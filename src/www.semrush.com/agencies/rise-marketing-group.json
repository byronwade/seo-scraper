Would recommend their services!\n\nSalem Co-operative Bank\non\nJun 4, 2024\n\nWe have been working with Rise Marketing Group to create a Google Analytics Looker Studio Dashboard, and our experience has been exceptional.

Ben has been so patient in explaining how Ads Manager works and what are the key indicators to look for. He is such a valuable member of the team, he has joined our team in preparing a manuscript! Highly recommend.\n\nWilson Hung\non\nMay 8, 2024\n\nWe hired Rise to help us launch on Adwords. Three main reasons why I recommend Rise: 1/ They're perfect for startups to go from v0->v1 to prove out the channel. They're extremely agile, nimble, and responsive. It helps when they have a full team of people who are experts at attribution, ad copy, reporting, and ad buying. So while my team was being built out, they were able to help out across multiple fuctions. 2/ The founder, Ben, is extremely approachable. Many agencies I work with, the founder just comes in for the sales call and then we never hear from them after the deal is closed. However, Ben checks in regularly to see how things are going and great suggestions. 3/ The team is fantastic. Our account manager was Ashley. She's very knowledgeable and what set her apart is not only does she identify opportunities, but she'll provide recommendations and a game plan to action it. Ultimately, we brought the channel in-house as we decided it was a core channel that we wanted to build internal capabilities for. But this was made possible because Rise did a fantastic job proving out the channel, and getting us to the point where we had confidence for increased investment. Highly recommend!\n\nAlisha Lumea\non\nJul 2, 2024\n\nRise has been a great partner to Wulf's Fish. Their counsel has always been knowledgeable and with our objectives in mind. We tried many different digital agencies before Rise, and they have been the best by far.\n\nOpen on Google\nNeed more information?\n\nNeed more data before you can make a decision and reach out to an agency?
