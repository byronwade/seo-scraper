  "content": "Using Semrush to Check Online Visibility\n\nOne of the first steps to take if you're new to Semrush is understanding your online visibility - where your website can already be found, where your competitors are, and what your goals and areas to improve should be. \n\nTo get a quick understanding of your online visibility, follow these steps:\n\n1. Compare Traffic Analytics\n\nThe best place on Semrush to understand how a website gets its traffic is the Traffic Analytics tool. Enter a domain and get info on its monthly visitors and their behavior on-site (pages/session, average session duration, bounce rate, etc). \n\nTo check your online visibility with this tool, enter your site and a few of your competitors to compare side by side. \n\nIf you don’t know who your competitors are, you can follow this workflow. \n\nWhen you enter multiple domains into this tool, you can see which sites get the most traffic from search, social media, paid search, direct, and referral traffic. \n\nWith this info, you can benchmark where your competitors are outperforming you to get an idea of what area of digital marketing you should focus on to grow your online visibility. \n\nSince these are your industry competitors, the amount of traffic they are getting can indicate how much more traffic is possible for your site to get if you can grow your online presence.\n\n2. Start a Project\n\nProjects are an 11-tool suite specifically designed to understand and enhance a website’s visibility. Setting up a Project is a great way to manage your own website or a client website as you run campaigns. \n\nLaunch a Project\n\nTo configure a Project, you need to enter the domain name and name your Project. Once you do that, you can start setting up any of the 11 tools in this suite - all of which will focus on the domain entered.\n\n3. Set up Position Tracking\n\nPosition Tracking tracks daily rankings on search results pages and measures your website’s visibility with a score that changes as it gains or loses positions for your target keywords. \n\nPosition Tracking is the easiest way to track how any SEO or PPC efforts are performing. The visibility score, estimated traffic, and average position metrics make monitoring and reporting progress simple and transparent. \n\nTo start this tool,  you need to enter a target location and your website’s target keywords. The visibility score reported by this tool is completely dependent on the target keywords and location being tracked - so make sure you choose the location and keywords that are actually important to your website/campaign. \n\nBelow is an example of how the configuration wizard looks during setup.\n\nIf you don’t know what keywords to track - no worries. Here’s a list of common sources of keywords you can use.\n\nStart with the core products, services, and keywords you KNOW are vital to your business\nUpload your keywords straight from Google Search Console into Position Tracking\nPull keywords from your industry competitors using the Organic Research Positions report on their domain. You can add filters like “keywords containing” that will give you more relevant keyword comparisons\nExpand upon the variations of the core keywords you’ve added by plugging them into our Keyword Magic tool. \n\nOnce you start the tool, it will begin gathering data every day on your and your competitors' rankings. You can check your overall status in the Landscape report and your specific keywords in the Overview report.\n\nYou’ll get an overall visibility score here that will give you an idea of how well you’re doing in the results and how much you can improve. You can check the specific keywords that you’re ranking for on the second page or below that you want to improve on in the Rankings report. \n\nThese keywords can be good starting points for quick wins, and you can use the keywords in this report to plan goals for your SEO and PPC campaigns. \n\n4. Create Your Project Dashboard\n\nThe Project Dashboard is another great place to keep your overview progress in mind. This dashboard connects to your Position Tracking campaign from your Project and can also integrate Google Analytics and Google Search Console. This puts all of your top-level metrics in one place. \n\nThis will be the best place to monitor your ongoing campaigns as you work towards your goals.  Bookmark this dashboard and watch your metrics grow as your campaigns run.\n\n5. Set Goals Based on Your Benchmarks\n\nNow that you have an established starting point for your visibility and a benchmark of where your competitors are, you can set goals. \n\nChoose goals that you can measure, like keyword positions in the top-3 results of Google, % of traffic share from social media, total monthly visits, or total clicks from search (which you can get from Google Search Console). \n\nTo help track your progress, you can set up “triggers” in Position Tracking campaign settings that send alerts via email whenever your site breaks a threshold in the SERP. \n\nThese triggers can be customized to tell you when your site or a competitor’s rankings change by a certain number or enter or leave a certain threshold of the SERP.\n\nYou can now use Semrush Position Tracking via a mobile app. Learn more here.\n\nFor quick wins: go back to your Project and set up the Site Audit and On Page SEO Checker tools. These tools will show you issues on your site that should be fixed for quick improvements and give you ideas for improving overall SEO. \n\nAs you work towards your goals, make use of My Reports to keep your client or your team on the same page regarding the website’s improving visibility. ",
