If you know your biggest competitors, you can gather insights into what they do well and build your own strategy to outperform theirs. This article will show you how to identify your top competitors using Semrush quickly.\n\nSemrush offers seven categories to find competitors based on the following criteria:\n\nOrganic Competitors (based on shared organic keyword rankings)\nBacklinks Competitors (based on shared backlinks)\nPaid Search Competitors (based on shared paid keyword rankings)\nPLA Competitors (based on shared Google Shopping keyword rankings)\nPosition Tracking Competitors Discovery (based on a custom list of target keywords)\nMarket Explorer (based on organic competitors and domain categories) \nDisplay Advertising Competitors (based on specific ads publishers and shared ads keywords)\n\nThis manual will provide more details about each competitive report type and where to find it.\n\nOrganic Competitors\n\nUse the Organic Research Competitors report to see all websites that frequently compete with your site for website traffic on organic search results.\n\nIf you want to improve SEO, this will show you your site’s top SEO competitors that you need to worry about.\n\nThe report is simple—just enter your domain name in the search bar (making sure you are under Organic Research and find the Competitors tab), and Semrush will list all of the sites that compete for the same keywords as the queried domain—based on common keywords and having a similar total organic keyword count.\n\nFor more info on how to use this report, read the user manual. To compare the exact similarities and differences between these competing domains’ organic keywords, you can use the Keyword Gap.\n\nIf you are working on a new website and don’t have any keyword rankings yet but you have a list of target keywords, you can use Position Tracking’s Competitors Discovery report to find the top competitors based on your keyword list.\n\nRun Organic Research\n\nBacklinks Competitors\n\nUse the Backlinks Competitors report to find the websites that have the most shared referring domains in their backlink profile as your site.\n\nThe reason you would want to know your competitors based on backlinks is if you want to improve your SEO with link building.\n\nThe report works very simply—go to Backlinks Analytics, enter your domain, and click on the “Competitors” tab. This will present the queried domain’s top competitors based on shared backlinks and referring domains.\n\nOnce you find out your site’s top competitors, you can look for new link building opportunities to build links to your own site based on who is linking to your competitors. For more on this report, check out the user manual.\n\nIf you want to find the exact similarities and differences between backlink profiles from all of these sites, you can enter them into the Backlink Gap. Here you can identify the backlinks that your competitors have that you don’t and make plans to acquire your own unique backlink from those sites.\n\nRun Backlink Analytics\n\nPaid Search Competitors\n\nGo to the Advertising Research Competitors report to find the websites competing with your site the most among Google’s PPC Google Ads results.\n\nThis report works very similarly to the Organic Research Competitors report in that it measures the competition level of websites by their shared keywords and similarity in total keyword count. However, the Advertising Research tool analyzes paid keywords. Enter your domain name under Advertising Research and click the Competitors tab to get the report.\n\nIf you want to improve the performance of your PPC campaigns, this report will show you the competitors you can analyze in Semrush to get more ideas and build your strategy to outperform theirs. For more, check out the user manual.\n\nOnce you’ve found your top advertising competitors, you can also compare keyword profiles and find gaps using the Keyword Gap tool and adding the filter for paid keywords.\n\nRun Advertising Research\n\nPLA Competitors\n\nAnother way to find advertising competitors is with the PLA Competitors report. PLA stands for Product Listings Ads, and this report will show you which sites compete with your site the most among Google Shopping results. Ensure you are under PLA Research when you query the domain and select the Competitors tab.\n\nCheck out the user manual for more on using our PLA reports to improve your Google Shopping campaigns.\n\nYou can also compare PLA keyword profiles and find gaps in your competition’s Google Shopping strategies using the Keyword Gap tool and adding the filter for PLA keywords.\n\nRun PLA Research\n\nPosition Tracking Competitors\n\nNow, if you don’t have any rankings yet but have a list of target keywords, you can find out who your top competitors will be by setting up a Position Tracking campaign.\n\nCreate a Project for your domain.\nGo to Position Tracking and start a new campaign.\nAdd your target keywords and location to start the tool. For help with configuration, read Configuring Position Tracking.\nNavigate to the Competitors Discovery tab and monitor the domains that appear in this report over time. These sites currently have the most visibility for your list of target keywords in the selected location.\n\nRead the user manual for more help using the Competitors Discovery report in Position Tracking.\n\nSet up Position Tracking\n\nIndustry Competitors\n\nA great way to see how your competitors in your industry are performing is by utilizing the Market Explorer tool, which is available as a part of Semrush .Trends. This tool gathers data using our Traffic Analytics database and third party data-providers to display estimated traffic and demographic information about a market’s audience. \n\nThis will provide you with a list of the top websites in the industry of the queried domain. When you click on your competitor's domain, you will see the metrics to the right reflect their traffic estimations.\n\nYou are able to see the total traffic of a domain, the total traffic trends, the domain’s top traffic sources, and the target audience’s age and gender.\n\n\n\nRun Market Explorer\n\nDisplay Ads Competitors\n\nAdClarity – Advertising Intelligence is a tool where you can discover Display Ads competitors and Video Ads competitors across a vast database of publisher websites and Social Media platforms (including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok). You can find AdClarity – Advertising Intelligence app in the Semrush App Center.\n\nWith AdClarity, you can discover your competitors that advertise on the same publisher sites, Social Media platforms, or YouTube channels as your business.\n\nFind the domain of a specific publisher or a YouTube channel name via the search bar at the top of the app's interface.\n\nThen, scroll down to the Top Ads, Top advertisers, and Top campaigns reports to gauge your competition.\n\nYou can also find your potential competition by shared keywords. Search by a keyword that describes your advertisements or product. Then, you'll be able to see your competitors' ads. Find the domain from the ad and search by it in AdClarity to uncover more about their advertising strategy. \n\nYou can check out this article for more information about the AdClarity – Advertising Intelligence app.\n\nGo to AdClarity – Advertising Intelligence\n\n \n\nAfter identifying your competitors, take the next step of your analysis with another how-to article:\n\nHow to Find Keyword Gaps in Your Market\nHow to Analyze a Competitor’s Advertising Strategy\nHow to Uncover Your Competitor’s Social Media Strategy\nHow to Benchmark Opportunities for Traffic Growth\n\nOr read more about Competitor Analysis in our blog:\n\nHow to Do a Competitor Analysis (Including Template)",
