You won't be able to pause or save your progress within the exam itself. Therefore, make sure you have sufficient time and are ready to focus when you begin the exam.\n\nWhat happens if I don’t pass my exam? Can I retake it?\nTo ensure a fair and comprehensive assessment, Semrush Academy allows enrollees a maximum of three attempts to pass the course exam and receive their certification.

However, we don't provide the correct answers to exams when they are not passed for several reasons:\n\nPromoting Learning: Our primary goal is to promote genuine learning and knowledge acquisition. By not immediately revealing the correct answers, we encourage users to review the course material and content, fostering a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\nExam Integrity: Providing the correct answers after an unsuccessful attempt could potentially compromise the integrity of the certification process. It might lead to users sharing answers, which undermines the value of the certification.\n\nPrivacy and Security: Protecting the privacy and security of our certification content is essential. Sharing correct answers indiscriminately can lead to unauthorized dissemination, impacting the quality of the certification.\n\nCertification Questions\nWhere can I find my certification?\nUpon successful completion of a certification course at Semrush Academy, you will be directed to a dedicated page where you can access a digital copy of your certification. On this page, you will have the option to download your certification for your personal records.\nDo certifications expire?\nYes, there is an expiration date for Semrush Academy certifications. Each certification is valid for a period of one year from the date of completion.
