Using Semrush gave them hands-on experience working with clients on SEO, content marketing, competitive research and analysis they can use in their professional careers. Semrush provided support and resources that made it easy to incorporate into my class plans as well as follow on opportunities for certification for those who wanted more.”\nJeremy Kagan\nProfessor, Columbia Business School and Cornell Tech.\n“As a student in the Digital Marketing course at the University of Auckland, I have found the Semrush for Education program to be an essential component of my studies. For one of my Digital Marketing assignments, I was required to use Semrush to conduct a digital audit for a company. I gained valuable skills and techniques that I believe will be useful in my future career. In addition to the insights provided by Semrush, the program also offers an industry-recognized Semrush SEO certificate, which I find empowering and valuable for obtaining skills and knowledge in the digital marketing industry.”\nJessica Mak\nStudent at the University of Auckland.\n\"We were glad to have Andrew Warden, CMO of Semrush, visit our Digital Marketing class. Andrew commented on trends and predictions from an industry expert perspective, which helped the students better understand the frameworks and techniques they learned in class. He also answered controversial questions like how ChatGPT helps with vs threatens to replace the work conducted by marketing analysts. Our students benefited a lot from the talk.\"\nXiaolin Li\nAssistant Professor of Marketing, Department of Management, The London School of Economics and Political Science.\n“The Semrush for Education programme is an essential component of our digital marketing class delivery. Industry certifications form a vital part of our assessment schedule, and access to the Semrush tool provides the necessary insights for our students to conduct a comprehensive digital audit of a live client's website. This empowers them with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the digital marketing industry.”\nPatrick Dodd\nProfessional Teaching Fellow, University of Auckland.\n“Our partners at Semrush provided access to the platform for use in our full-time MBA program. My students used Semrush for in-class activities and a semester-long Digital Marketing Audit project. Students were able to get real-world, hands-on experience with SEO, content marketing, and analytics by using Semrush, and many students went on to earn a Semrush certification. I can tell you, without hesitation, that having access to Semrush has been an amazing learning experience for our students.”\nMark Arnold\nDepartment Chair; Clarence and Helen Steber, Professor Department of Marketing, Saint Louis University.\n“The Semrush for Education program takes my students' experiences to the next level. I am extremely impressed with the quality of the content and the level of expertise that the instructors bring to the table through the hands-on approach to learning across multiple digital marketing subjects. Students also find it so valuable to get experience with such a well-known tool like Semrush and use those experiences in their jobs or during the interview process.”\nAshley Hass\nAssistant Professor of Marketing, University of Portland.\n“The reality of using the Semrush for Education program is that many students walk away with a much better grasp of SEO, content marketing, social media and marketing analytics. The program videos along with giving students the ability to go hands-on with Semrush tools and obtain certification are key to their learning from a practical perspective.”\nMark Tietbohl\nAdjunct instructor for Web Analytics/SEO and Mobile Marketing - IMC program, West Virginia University.\n”Semrush is a game-changing digital marketing research tool that has revolutionized the way students conduct their research.
