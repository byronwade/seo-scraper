Everything we do here is backed up with data, and your tool is giving us more ammunition. \n\nIdan Segal\nOrganic Growth Lead, Wix\n\n The most important thing I can have really is data. Data is my currency. I need to support initiatives, business cases - any tools that give me insight I find incredibly useful. Semrush is a very solid package that delivers exactly that. \n\nNick Wilsdon\nProduct Owner, Search, Vodafone Group\n\n Encouraged by our successes with Semrush software, I was asked to rollout Semrush to the rest of the university including all the faculties. With the help of Semrush, we empowered every single marketing team within the university to do what was done for the central sites. \n\nShefali Joshi\nMarketing Optimization Analyst, Monash University\n\n The competition is really tough. It’s getting harder to compete for the top 3 positions when it comes to the most popular KWs. You have to really deep dive into keyword research to find those untapped opportunities. Semrush helps us get to the very bottom of it to identify new type of terms can really help to drive the demand. \n\nJames Gibbons\nGrowth Manager, Skyscanner\n\n In the first 5 years of RockContent's existence Semrush has helped us to become Brazil's biggest digital marketing blog. \n\nVitor Peçanha\nCo-Founder, Rock Content\n\n By using Semrush, my team saves a lot of time by working on the right content and in a more data-driven way.
