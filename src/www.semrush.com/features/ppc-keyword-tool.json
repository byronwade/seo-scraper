The ‘Remove duplicates’ button will delete them in one click. You can also quickly remove special characters and unnecessary figures. Keyword grouping is another important stage in preparing a PPC campaign. A manual drag-and-drop feature is available, or, if you prefer, choose the ‘1 keyword = 1 group’ option.\n\nCross-Match Negative Keywords\nAvoid any cross-group duplicates\n\nWhen using the broad or modified broad match type in your campaigns, cross-matching negative keywords can be a real headache. Some search terms may cause your ads to compete with each other, making your CPC grow. The ‘Cross-group negatives’ function will save you hours, especially when you manage big campaigns.\n\nStay on budget and avoid competition among your own ads!\nRegister now\nPolish your keyword list with Recommendation\nThe Recommendations feature allows you to bring your campaign to perfection\nClean keywords\nImprove your keyword list by clearing out any unnecessary prepositions, articles, or other irrelevant keyword modifiers.\nRemove duplicates\nGet rid of keywords that are found in multiple ad groups.
