You can pull numbers from both sources associated with Google (Search Console, Ads, Sheets, etc.) and non-Google platforms (Facebook, Reddit, etc.). You can show website performance based on multiple sources in the same report, enabling your clients to see the bigger picture.\n\nEasily share your data with clients\n\nWhether you want to share with individuals or teams, just send them a link.
