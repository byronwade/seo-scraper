  "content": "What Is an A Href Link?\n\nAn “a href link” (or “href link”) is HTML code that uses an <a> tag and href attribute to create a clickable hyperlink. \n\nFor example, this href link creates the hyperlink “Semrush”:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">Semrush</a>\n\nThere are other types of HTML links (e.g., the <link> tag). And other ways to create hyperlinks (e.g., with JavaScript). But most links are created using <a> tags, also known as anchor tags or anchor elements. \n\nAnchor elements are defined by the start tag <a> and the end tag </a>.\n\nThe href attribute (hypertext reference attribute) defines the link destination or target. This is often a webpage URL. But there are other possible values.\n\nAnchor tags should also include anchor content—the content that the link is attached to. In many cases, this is anchor text (e.g., “Semrush”). But it can be an HTML element, such as an image.\n\nYour content management system (CMS) might have tools that eliminate the need to code a href links manually. But it’s helpful to understand how they work behind the scenes.\n\nTip: Check for link issues and other technical problems on your site with Semrush’s Site Audit tool. You can crawl up to 100 URLs for free.\n\nFind and Fix Link Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nWhy Are Href Links Important?\n\nHref links are important because they’re the most commonly used way to create hyperlinks. And hyperlinks help users and web crawlers to navigate the internet and access digital resources.\n\nThere are two main types of hyperlinks you can add to your website: internal links and external links. And a href links allow you to create both.\n\nInternal links are hyperlinks to locations or resources on your domain. \n\nExamples include:\n\nNavigational links to other pages on your site\nContextual links to other pages on your site\nAnchor links (or jump links) on your pages\nLinks to files (e.g., ebooks) on your domain’s server\n\nBy using internal links effectively, you encourage users to explore your site. This might mean that they’re more likely to make a purchase, share your content, or take another desirable action.\n\nPlus, internal links help Google discover pages on your domain. And understand how they fit together. This can lead to higher rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nExternal links (or outbound links) are hyperlinks to locations or resources outside your domain.\n\nUsed properly, external links add value to your content.\n\nFor example, you can build trust by linking out to reliable sources. Or share a useful tool that isn’t available on your site.\n\nGoogle’s John Mueller claims that external links to reputable sites don’t help with website rankings. But many SEO professionals believe that they do.\n\n5 Best Practices for A Href Links\n\nWhen creating a href links, follow these best practices to ensure your hyperlinks work properly. And benefit your site as much as possible.\n\n1. Choose the Right Href Attribute Value\n\nThe href attribute value is the link destination. This can be a webpage, part of a webpage, file, email address, or phone number, for example.\n\nThe link destination is placed in between the quotation marks of the href attribute, like so:\n\nhref=\"value\"\n\nLet’s explore the main types of href values:\n\nRelative URLs\n\nA relative URL is a path to a resource on the same website.\n\nFor example, our Semrush blog logo has the href value “/blog/”:\n\nSome web developers use relative URLs for all internal links. Because they’re concise. And they can still function after a site migration.\n\nHowever, we recommend using absolute URLs for SEO purposes. \n\nAbsolute URLs\n\nAn absolute URL is the full path to a URL, including the protocol, domain, and any additional paths or parameters.\n\nFor example:\n\nhref=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/\"\n\nYou’ll need to use absolute URLs when adding external links.\n\nBut they’re also helpful for internal links. Because you can always link to the canonical URL—the preferred version of a duplicated page.\n\nThis removes any ambiguity or confusion for search engines. So it can help your SEO.\n\nIn a Google video, John Mueller said that linking to canonical URLs “probably makes a little bit more sense, because then you don’t have to worry about things like [Google or users] accessing the non-WWW version of your website.”\n\nAnchor Links\n\nAnchor links (or jump links) are links to different parts of the same page. \n\nFor example, all the links in the table of contents for this article are anchor links.\n\nTo create a jump link, give the element you want to link to an id attribute (id=\"id-name\").\n\nLike this:\n\n<h2 id=\"faqs\">FAQs</h2>\n\nThen, create the link by using #id-name as the href value.\n\nLike so:\n\n<a href=\"#faqs\">jump to our FAQs</a>\n\nAlternatively, use href=\"#top\" or href=\"#\" to create a jump to the top of the page. \n\nMailto Links\n\nThe href=\"mailto:\" attribute creates a mailto link that opens a new email in the user’s email program.\n\nIt’s typically used in combination with a target email address.\n\nFor example, we have an href link like this in our site footer:\n\n<a href=\"mailto:mail@semrush.com\">mail@semrush.com</a>\n\nClicking the hyperlink creates an email draft like this:\n\nYou can also add parameters such as a subject line, body content, and CC address to the a href code.\n\nLet’s say you want job applicants to send their resume to jobs@example.com with the subject line “Web Developer Role.”\n\nTo make it easier, you could add an an HTML link like this:\n\n<a href=\"mailto:jobs@example.com?subject=Web%20Developer%20Role\">Apply Now</a>\n\nNote that “%20” is used instead of spaces. This is an example of URL encoding—a process that helps ensure parameters work properly.\n\nTel Links\n\nTo create a tel link, use the href=\"tel:\" attribute in combination with the phone number.\n\nLike so:\n\nWhen the user clicks the hyperlink on a compatible device, it’ll open the number on their dialer app. Making it easy for them to call you.\n\n2. Use Other Anchor Tag Attributes\n\nThe href attribute is important in an anchor element because it defines the link destination. But you can add other anchor tag attributes to determine what happens when the user clicks the link.\n\nThese attributes can also help search engines understand your links. And therefore benefit your SEO. \n\nHere’s a quick overview of the most common ones:\n\nAnchor Attribute\n\n\t\n\nPurpose\n\n\t\n\nAnchor Tag Example\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\t\n\nTell the browser to download the linked resource instead of opening it.\n\nInclude a descriptive filename in-between the quotation marks.\n\n\t\n\n<a href=\"example.pdf\" download=\"Filename\">Download [PDF]</a>\n\n\n\n\nRel\n\n\t\n\nInform search engines about your site’s relationship with the linked resource.\n\nFor example, rel=“nofollow” asks search engines to avoid treating the link as an endorsement of the linked page. (This is an important concept in link building.)\n\n\t\n\n<a href=\"https://www.example.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anchor Text</a>\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\n\t\n\nTell the browser where to open the link.\n\nFor example, target=\"_blank\" opens the resource in a new tab or window. While target=\"_self\" keeps it in the same frame.\n\n\t\n\n<a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Semrush</a>\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\t\n\nShow a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. \n\nInclude the tooltip text in-between the quotation marks.\n\n\t\n\n<a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\" title=\"Semrush homepage\">Semrush</a>\n\nTip: Certain kinds of links from other sites (backlinks) can benefit your SEO. With Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool, you can easily analyze your backlinks and compare them to competitors’.\n\nGet Insights on Backlink Profiles\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Use the Correct Syntax\n\nIt’s essential to use the correct syntax when creating a href links. If you don’t put things in the right order, your hyperlink won’t work as expected.\n\nHref syntax works like this:\n\nStart the a href link with <a\nAdd correctly formatted attributes inside the start tag\nLeave a space before each anchor tag attribute\nUse straight (not curly) quotation marks\nClose the start tag with >\nAdd your anchor content\nEnd the tag with </a>\n\nTip: Learn about other tags and how to use them with our HTML cheat sheet and semantic HTML guide.\n\n4. Optimize the Anchor Content\n\nAnchor content is the content that a link is attached to. So it’s important that it makes sense on your page.\n\nPlus, search engines use anchor content to understand what the linked page is about. Consistently optimizing it can improve your SEO.\n\nIn many cases, links are attached to anchor text (also known as HTML link text).\n\nLike this:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.example.com/\">Anchor Text Here</a>\n\nTry to avoid generic anchor text, like “Click here.”\n\nInstead, use descriptive anchor text. To help users and search engines understand what the linked resource is about.\n\nWhen linking to other pages on your site, use target keywords in anchor text where natural. This can help you establish relevance and improve your Google rankings.\n\nTo create an image link in HTML, add an image element to the anchor tag. (Instead of anchor text.)\n\nAnd include alt text. So search engines and people using screen readers know what the image depicts. \n\nFor example:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.example.com/product-category/product-name\"><img src=\"product-image.png\" alt=\"This is a description of the product image\"></a>\n\nYou can use SVGs, styled text, and other HTML elements as anchor content. \n\nTip: Perform keyword research with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. To identify target keywords for every page on your site and optimize links accordingly.\n\nFind Target Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Check Your Links Regularly\n\nHref links that don’t work properly provide a poor user experience. And can harm your SEO. So it’s important to check the ones on your site regularly.\n\nEven the tiniest mistake in your HTML can cause problems. Plus, hyperlinks may decay over time as link destinations get changed or removed.\n\nWith Semrush’s Site Audit tool, you can check for link issues at scale.\n\nAfter setting up, find the “Internal Linking” report and click “View details.”\n\nThen, look at the “Internal Link Issues” to see whether you have:\n\nBroken links (links that point to a nonexistent destination)\nToo many on-page links (more than 3,000 links on a single page)\nInternal links with nofollow attributes\nOrphan pages (sitemap pages without any internal links pointing to them)\nLinks with missing or non-descriptive anchor text\n\nAnd many other issues.\n\nClick “Learn more” or “Why and how to fix it” alongside any issue for more context.\n\nOr click the “# issues” button to see the affected URLs.\n\nUse the checkboxes and “Send to…” button to create tasks in the Semrush CRM, Trello, or Zapier. (Make sure to set up the integration first.)\n\nOr hide issues that don’t need resolving.\n\nDon’t forget to check other reports in Site Audit. To find and fix other technical SEO issues on your site.\n\nAnd rerun the audit every month or more. To catch any new issues that arise.\n\nFind and Fix Link Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
