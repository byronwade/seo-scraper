  "content": "What Is B2B Content Marketing?\n\nB2B content marketing is creating and distributing content to earn the attention of other businesses. And ultimately convert them into loyal customers (or clients).\n\nSome of the most popular types of B2B content are blog posts, white papers, templates, case studies, videos, webinars, and podcasts.\n\nThe most successful B2B content addresses the target companies’ needs and goals. Which may include professional challenges employees face.\n\n(This differs from B2C content marketing, which focuses on consumers’ personal interests.)\n\nFor example, Xero publishes small business guides. To attract audiences that might be interested in its accounting software.\n\nSome companies have an in-house marketing team or specialist to manage their B2B content marketing. Others work with external freelancers or content agencies.\n\nBut even solopreneurs can benefit from B2B content marketing.\n\nWhy Content Marketing Is Important for B2B Businesses\n\nContent marketing is important for B2B businesses because it can deliver a high return on investment (ROI). This is partly because it’s a relatively low-cost channel.\n\nYou need to account for labor costs. And potentially budget for content creation tools. But content marketing rarely incurs large financial investments (like those you can face with advertising and events).\n\nPlus, content often has a long life span. It can continue to deliver value for months or even years after it’s published.\n\nBy creating content your target audience values, you can:\n\nEarn search engine rankings that drive valuable traffic to your site\nGenerate social media shares that boost brand awareness\nEarn backlinks that drive traffic and benefit your SEO\nEstablish your brand as an industry authority\nBuild trust with prospects and customers\nEducate prospects about your brand and solution\nGain a competitive edge over your rivals\n\nB2B content marketing is an inbound marketing channel that aims to pull in leads naturally. It attempts to earn audiences’ attention (and business) by delivering genuine value.\n\nBest Practices for B2B Content Marketing\n\nEngage business prospects with these best practices for B2B content marketing.\n\n1. Conduct Audience Research\n\nAudience research is the number one factor that marketers and business owners say leads to success in content marketing, according to Semrush’s State of Content Marketing 2023 report.\n\nOnly by understanding your target audience can you create content that appeals to them. And distribute it effectively.\n\nIn B2B content marketing, your target audience encompasses businesses that might buy your products or services. More specifically, the relevant decision-makers who work at those companies.\n\nFor example, a commercial bank might target financial directors at manufacturing firms.\n\nYou can learn about your existing website users in Google Analytics.\n\nGo to “Reports” > “User” > “User Attributes” > “Overview.”\n\nThen look at the breakdown of users by country, age group, gender, language, and more.\n\nFor further insights, investigate your competitors’ audiences in Semrush’s One2Target tool.\n\nChoose a location, enter the domains of up to five rivals, then click “Analyze.”\n\nYou’ll see the “Demographics” report first. Which provides demographic data like age and location.\n\nNext, head to the “Socioeconomics” tab.\n\nThe “Employment Status” and “Education Level” charts can help you learn more about the audience’s professional status. Which is particularly useful in B2B content marketing, because it helps you understand their job roles.\n\nThose charts look like this:\n\nIn the “Behavior” tab, you can see which social media channels your competitors’ audiences use most. \n\nThese channels can be great places to distribute your content.\n\nWhatever audience research methods you use, try compiling your findings into buyer personas. These are profiles that represent different segments of your target audience.\n\nWith Semrush’s Persona tool, you can build B2B buyer personas step by step.\n\nFollow the instructions to create profiles like this:\n\nThen, reference your personas throughout the B2B content marketing process. The information will help you decide what content to create for different audiences and where to share it.\n\nAnalyze Your Target Audience\n\nwith Semrush’s One2Target Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Perform a Content Audit\n\nA content audit is an analysis of your existing content. This helps you spot opportunities for improvement. And gain insights to guide your B2B content strategy.\n\nGenerally, it’s a good idea to improve existing content before creating new content. Because:\n\nExisting content may have untapped potential\nUpdating content is generally quicker and easier than creating from scratch\nPoor-quality content can harm your brand’s reputation\nLarge amounts of unhelpful content can harm your site’s performance in Google Search\n\nYou can analyze your website content for free using Google Analytics.\n\nGo to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Engagement” > “Pages and screens” to see the pages on your site alongside key engagement metrics. (The report shows data for the past 28 days by default.)\n\nLike this:\n\nDepending on the nature of the page, a comparatively low number of views, users, or conversions could indicate that there’s room for improvement.\n\nAlso pay attention to the average engagement time. A low number suggests that the content may not provide what your audience wants.\n\nYou can see these metrics in the table at the bottom of the page:\n\nTo see how your pages perform in Google Search, use Google Search Console.\n\nGo to “Performance,” choose the “Search results” report, and check all the boxes.\n\nThen, scroll down and click the “PAGES” tab.\n\nYou’ll see the following data for each page on your site:\n\nClicks: The number of organic (unpaid) clicks from Google Search\nImpressions: The number of times the page appeared in visible search results\nCTR: Click-through rate—the percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks to the page\nPosition: The average position of the page’s organic rankings\n\nClick any page URL and then “QUERIES” to see the search queries (keywords) it ranks for. And each query’s individual metrics.\n\nAlternatively, use Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker.\n\nThe tool analyzes your landing pages and target keywords to provide tailored suggestions.\n\nThese recommendations may relate to content, user experience, and more.\n\nAfter setting up your project, go to the “Optimization Ideas” tab to access suggestions by page.\n\nTo focus on pages that need content improvements, select the arrow next to “All Ideas.”\n\nThen, choose “Content” from the drop-down menu.\n\nThe tool prioritizes pages for you. Based on the potential traffic gains.\n\nClick “# ideas” to see detailed recommendations for any URL.\n\nFor example, “Focus on creating more informative content” suggests that your rivals have more comprehensive content on their pages. And you could benefit from increasing your word count to cover the topic more extensively.\n\nImprove Your B2B Content\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Create Content for All Phases of the Marketing Funnel\n\nUnderstanding the customer journey is crucial to creating content that supports it. But B2B journeys are complex and varied.\n\nThat’s where the content marketing funnel comes in. It’s a simplified model of the customer journey that can guide your B2B content strategy.\n\nThe funnel shape represents the audience narrowing as their journey moves toward purchase (and beyond). It’s typically split into three sections:\n\nTop of the funnel (ToFu): People become aware of the problem you can solve\nMiddle of the funnel (MoFu): Prospects want a solution and consider their options\nBottom of the funnel (BoFu): Prospects decide on a solution and become customers\n\nBy creating content for users at each stage, you can reduce the risk that they’ll drop out of the funnel. And ultimately turn more prospects into loyal customers.\n\nToFu content should generate brand awareness. Typically, the main goal is attracting more visitors to your website.\n\nFor example, online payments provider Stripe has a guide to corporate structures. It’s not designed to sell Stripe’s services directly. It’s designed to attract early-stage prospects. Specifically, people starting a new business.\n\nThe page gets around 12,400 organic visits per month from Google users in the U.S. alone, according to Semrush’s Organic Research tool.\n\nMoFu content is aimed at people who are researching your solution. It should educate and guide them through the decision-making process.\n\nAt this stage, Stripe offers more product-focused content. Like this guide to monetizing payments:\n\nBoFu content should propel conversions.\n\nProduct overviews, customer reviews, and success stories (also called case studies) are the most popular content formats at this stage, according to a Semrush survey.\n\nNotice how this Stripe case study features a “Contact sales” button. This call to action nudges leads toward the all-important contact page.\n\nThe bottom of the funnel should also encompass post-purchase content. \n\nEffective aftercare can create loyal customers—people who purchase again and advocate for your brand. It can also reduce strain on your customer support team.\n\nStripe has a support center full of useful content. But it also publishes industry news, product updates, and other content to keep customers happy and engaged.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Content\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Experiment with Content Types\n\nPublishing different types of B2B content helps you engage people with various needs and preferences. \n\nPlus, new formats can give you access to new distribution channels.\n\nFor example, creating podcasts allows you to engage audiences on platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify. While videos can help you tap into YouTube’s user base.\n\nLet’s look at some of the most popular types of content marketing in the B2B sector:\n\nContent Type\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBlog posts\n\n\t\n\nWith the right blog topics, you can establish your brand as an authority in the field. And nurture leads through the marketing funnel.\n\nPerform keyword research to find the most-searched questions and queries in your niche. \n\n\n\n\nSuccess stories\n\n\t\n\nAlso known as case studies. These are detailed accounts of customers’ success with your business and solution.\n\nLots of people look for their peers’ approval (called “social proof”) before doing business with a brand. Or testing a new solution.\n\n\n\n\nResearch reports\n\n\t\n\nPublishing original research can help establish your brand as a thought leader in its niche.\n\nPlus, interesting findings can generate press coverage and links. Which help drive traffic to your site.\n\n\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\t\n\nLong-form audio recordings distributed on platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify allow you to cover topics in depth and in a conversational way. \n\nPodcasts are popular among busy professionals because they can be consumed on the go.\n\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\t\n\nMarketers and business owners say video is the best-performing content format, according to Semrush’s State of Content Marketing report. \n\nVideos can help users absorb a large amount of information in a relatively short amount of time.\n\n\n\n\nWebinars\n\n\t\n\nWebinar hosting is a popular lead generation strategy because it allows you to collect attendees’ contact details.\n\nWebinars provide a low-cost alternative to in-person events. \n\nWhatever content types you choose, it’s a good idea to repurpose content—i.e., convert it into different formats. \n\nThis can help you maximize your investment in content creation. Because it’s generally quicker and easier than creating from scratch.\n\nTry starting out with simpler formats so you can cost-effectively test and develop concepts.\n\nLet’s say you’re interested in hosting a webinar on trends impacting your industry. \n\nInstead of jumping right in with a webinar, write a LinkedIn post about the topic first. This will help you gauge interest. And potentially gather useful feedback.\n\n5. Build Topical Authority\n\nWhen you build topical authority in your niche, you become a go-to source of information. This helps increase brand awareness and trust. And it can lead to higher Google rankings.\n\nOne of the best ways to build topical authority is to publish a variety of helpful content related to a particular subject.\n\nIn other words, accurate, comprehensive, and insightful content that delivers genuine value to users. And showcases your expertise.\n\nSome of these pieces may take the form of thought leadership. This is content that demonstrates a unique insight or opinion on a topic. With the goal of influencing others.\n\nTo come up with strong content ideas, you should:\n\nKeep up to date with industry news and trends\nPerform keyword research to see what people search for\nMonitor relevant conversations on Reddit, Quora, and social media channels\nSpeak to other influencers in your niche\n\nFor a data-driven approach to idea generation, use Semrush’s Topic Research tool.\n\nEnter a topic, choose a country, then click “Get content ideas.”\n\nBy default, the tool prioritizes subtopic ideas by “Topic Efficiency.”\n\nThis is a measure of search opportunity, which considers:\n\nKeyword volume: The average number of monthly searches for the subtopic\nKeyword difficulty: A measure of how hard it will be to rank on Google’s first page\n\nClick the “Show more” button to see headlines, questions, and search queries related to each subtopic.\n\nWhen you’re ready to proceed with an idea, click “...” and then “Create SEO template.”\n\nThis will import your keywords to Semrush’s SEO Content Template tool.\n\nAdjust your settings if you want. Then click “Create content template.”\n\nThe tool will provide content recommendations based on the top 10 results for your target keywords. This includes readability and text length suggestions.\n\nWhen you’re ready to start writing, go to the “Real-time Content Check” tab.\n\nHere, you can open the SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nThe SEO Writing Assistant provides real-time recommendations related to SEO, readability, originality, and tone of voice.\n\nIf you get stuck, you can compose or rephrase content using AI.\n\nBuild Topical Authority\n\nwith the Content Marketing Platform\n\nStart Your Free Trial →\n6. Distribute Your Content Effectively\n\nAn effective content distribution strategy helps ensure that your target audience discovers your content.\n\nLet’s look at some of the most popular distribution channels in B2B content marketing:\n\nDistribution Channel\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBlogs\n\n\t\n\nPublishing high-quality blog posts can be a great way to generate organic traffic (unpaid search engine traffic).\n\nYou can optimize your content for search using on-page SEO tactics. Try using our on-page SEO checklist.\n\n\n\n\nEmail marketing\n\n\t\n\nEmail marketing is a great way to maintain contact with leads. \n\nYou can link out to your content from your emails. But you may improve engagement by placing content directly within the email.\n\n\n\n\nSocial media\n\n\t\n\nLinkedIn is a professional networking site, so it’s one of the most popular social media platforms among B2B businesses.\n\nYou can publish articles and posts, share videos and images, and much more. Check out our dedicated guide to learn more about LinkedIn marketing.\n\n\n\n\nContent syndication\n\n\t\n\nContent syndication is the process of getting your content republished on other sites or platforms.\n\nThe publisher should always credit you with a mention and a link.\n\n\n\n\nPaid channels\n\n\t\n\nIf you have an advertising budget, you may wish to promote your content through paid channels.\n\nPPC can be a great way to generate search traffic while you’re working on organic rankings.\n\nWhatever distribution channels you use, track metrics that align with your B2B content marketinggoals.\n\nThis allows you to see what’s working. So you can make adjustments as necessary. And use resources more effectively in the future.\n\nFor example, Semrush’s Position Tracking tool makes it easy to track your Google rankings.\n\nAfter configuring the tool, head to the “Overview” tab.\n\nThe “Visibility” graph shows your search visibility over time.\n\nScroll down to see how you’re performing for each target keyword you’re tracking.\n\nTo learn more about content marketing metrics, check out our guide.\n\n7. Document Your B2B Content Strategy\n\nA B2B content marketing strategy is a long-term plan that outlines how a business will attract their business customers through content.\n\nWhen creating a B2B content strategy, you need to define your goals and consider:\n\nWhat content you will create\nWhy you will create it\nWhen, where, and how you will distribute it\n\nReferencing this strategy helps keep your B2B content marketing efforts focused.
