  "content": "Writing interesting blog posts isn't enough to build a brand. Or generate recurring income. \n\nA successful blog also needs successful marketing. \n\nOur guide will give you foundational tips to market your blog like a business. Helping you drive traffic and visibility, connect with new readers, and get your content in front of the right people.\n\nNo matter your niche, here’s how to promote a blog strategically:\n\nOptimize Your Content for Search Engines\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) isn’t an explicitly promotional tactic. But it’s key for driving traffic to your blog. \n\nThat’s because SEO helps your content rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs). Which boosts the likelihood of searchers clicking on your blog posts.\n\nAs noted in a Backlinko study, on average, the first result on Google gets 27.6% of all clicks for that search. And traffic decreases as you go down the rankings.\n\nThere's a lot that goes into SEO. Including different on-page SEO, technical SEO, and off-page SEO methods. But for the purposes of this article, we’re just covering some basic techniques to get you started. \n\nFurther reading: The Importance of SEO: 10 Benefits of Search Engine Optimization\n\nConduct Keyword Research \n\nTo help promote your blog, you need to optimize your blog posts with relevant keywords (or search terms and phrases) that make your content more SEO-friendly.\n\nFor example, a high-quality blog post optimized for \"first-date outfits\" or \"what to wear on a first date\" is more likely to appear in search results when users enter these keywords into Google.\n\nStart by brainstorming potential keywords that align with your blog post topics. If you were writing a meal prep guide, you’d ask yourself, “What words or phrases would someone enter to find meal prep tips online?” \n\nPhrases like meal prep ideas\" and \"how to meal prep for the week\" would make sense.\n\nAs you’re thinking of ideas, use Google's Autocomplete function to generate even more popular, related terms.\n\nThis initial list contains your \"seed\" keywords—the search terms you’ll use as a basis for your research.\n\nEnter one of your seed keywords into the search bar. Select your target market, such as the United States or the United Kingdom, and click \"Search.\"\n\nOur tool will generate a list of search terms related to your seed keyword.\n\nYou can see the monthly search volume over a 12-month period. And the keyword difficulty (KD%) for each search term.\n\nThe latter shows how hard it would be for a website to rank in Google's top 10 organic (unpaid) results for a given keyword. Generally, less competitive keywords have a lower KD score.\n\nSort and filter the results by search volume, keyword difficulty, user intent (the purpose behind a search query), or other criteria.\n\nIn this example, we’ll use the filters to select keywords with at least 100 monthly searches and a KD score of 0% to 49%. These have a decent amount of monthly searches. And they won’t be extremely difficult to rank for.\n\nNow, we have a list of 91 keywords.\n\nOptimize your post for one primary keyword, or main search term, such as \"vegetarian meal prep ideas.\" Weave it into your copy naturally and in other strategic spots, including the:\n\nPage URL\nBlog post title\nAt least one subheading\nImage alt text \nTitle tag\nMeta description\n\nAnd add in secondary keywords where relevant. These are search terms related to your main keyword, like \"vegetable meal prep ideas\" or \"plant-based meal prep ideas.\"\n\nRepeat these steps each time you write a new post. \n\nJust make sure you avoid keyword stuffing—a practice that involves saturating a web page with a bunch of keywords to try and boost your search rankings. This tactic goes against Google's guidelines and may result in penalties.\n\nPro tip\n\nGo one step further and use your target keyword in social media posts, video transcripts, image file names, and other types of content you share online.\n\nFurther reading: How to Do Keyword Research for SEO (A Detailed 3-Step Guide)\n\nFind Keywords for Your Blog\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUse Pillar Pages and Topic Clusters to Organize Your Content\n\nOnce you have a list of keywords, create pillar pages and topic clusters around them.\n\nA pillar page covers a topic in depth. Like an \"ultimate guide.\" This page then links out to related content covering specific subtopics.\n\nWith this approach, you make it easier for visitors to discover more of your posts.\n\nAnd you build internal links, or hyperlinks that point to pages on the same website. Search engines use these to navigate your blog and gain a better understanding of its content. These links also pass authority from one web page to another, which can help boost their visibility in search results. \n\nWhen creating your pillar pages, leave room for more detail in subsequent posts. Choose broad topics so you can break them down into multiple sub-topics, as shown above.\n\nFor example, you could create a pillar page about “podcasting for beginners.” After that, you would write additional pages, or cluster content, covering relevant sub-topics like:\n\nPodcast room ideas\nHow to write a podcast intro\nPodcast kit\nCheap podcast studio\nHow to set up podcast equipment\n\nHere's what this topic cluster would look like:\n\nOptimize each page for one primary keyword and multiple secondary keywords related to the topic.\n\nThen, use SEO Writing Assistant to fine-tune your content. Our tool gives your posts scores for its:\n\nSEO\nTone of voice\nReadability \nOriginality\n\nAnd gives you clear suggestions to improve each area. \n\nIn the example below, see how the platform analyzed the piece based on its target keywords. And offered extra ones to boost its ranking potential.\n\nHave AI Review Your Blog Posts\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign up Now →\nPromote Your Blog on Social Media \n\nPromoting your blog on social media networks helps you connect with more potential readers—especially if your content goes viral. It's an opportunity to increase blog traffic, build loyal audiences, and establish your authority online.\n\nFor example, this low-carb banana bread recipe published by The Big Man's World got 543 likes and 217 shares on Facebook.\n\nIts author, Arman Liew, wrote a short caption and shared a photo to tease readers. But he didn't disclose the recipe in the actual Facebook post. Instead, he linked to his blog post with it in the comments section.\n\nThis approach hooks readers in and leaves them wanting to know more. Which drives them to click on the related blog content.\n\nLike Liew, you can create shareable content on social media to get exposure for your blog. Here are some strategies worth trying:\n\nShare High-Quality Content to Drive Engagement\n\nThe content you share on social media channels should resonate with the target audience and provide value.\n\nDon't just share a link to an article or blog post or say something like, \"Click here to see my favorite pre-workout snacks.\" As Liew did, you want to capture the reader’s attention by first hinting at the topic you cover on your blog—without giving away too much information.\n\nReturning to the above example, you could say, \"These pre-workout snacks feel like a treat! They're just perfect for those days when you need a quick energy boost, but don't have time for a full meal. Fun fact: They taste like Oreos and only have 80 calories per serving.\"\n\nInclude a link to your blog and a relevant image or video that’ll capture reader attention. Here’s an example from The Recipe Critic: \n\nBut remember: not every social post needs to link out to your blog content. Sharing relevant, unique insights and tips that entertain or educate users can still help grow your following and drive engagement.\n\nFor example, Lean Bodies Consulting shared 10 ways to get an extra 30+ grams of protein into your diet. The post got 91 comments on Facebook alone. \n\nPro tip\n\nUse hashtags to increase your reach on social media. Incorporate your target keywords in hashtags, post captions, photo descriptions, and alt text.\n\nDiversify Your Social Media Content\n\nPromote your blog with a mix of videos, images, live streams, and text posts.\n\nDifferent people prefer different types of content. And certain content formats may perform better than others, depending on the platform, device type, and user location.\n\nIn a 2022 survey, 66% of consumers agreed that short-form videos were the most engaging type of content shared by marketers on social media. The next most popular choices included:\n\nImages\nLive videos\nMemes and GIFs\nText-based posts\nUser-generated content (USG)\nLong-form videos\n\nLet's say you want to promote a blog post about the benefits of going vegan. Consider sharing the following types of content on social media:\n\nShort recipe videos featuring vegan meals and snacks\nInfographics that highlight the key benefits of a vegan lifestyle\nExcerpts or summaries from your blog post\nActionable tips for transitioning to a vegan lifestyle\nPrintable vegan grocery lists or nutrition cheat sheets\n\nFor example, the vegan blog/vlog Pick Up Limes shared a video featuring healthy eating hacks. Since its upload in 2019, it’s received over 8.7 million views, 341,000 likes, and 6,000 comments.\n\nThis can probably be partially attributed to the bonus resources the channel links to, including its free weekly meal planner and grocery shopping list. These extra goodies hook viewers (and readers) in.\n\nBesides free, helpful content, Pick Up Limes also clearly links to their social accounts and newsletter sign-up. Making it easy for interested users to further engage with the brand.\n\nPro tip\n\nRepurpose your blog posts into social media content to save time and grow your reach. For instance, you could create video versions of your blog posts and share them on YouTube, Instagram, or Facebook. Compare different content repurposing tools to find one that works for you.\n\nHow to Create Videos for Social Media\n\nAs we mentioned, short videos tend to drive the most engagement on social media. \n\nUse the Instant Video Creator app to easily generate high-quality videos from any blog post or article. And from-scratch videos that complement your blog posts and other content assets. \n\nYou have three options:\n\nURL to Video: Create videos based on existing blog posts\nAI Prompt: Enter a topic and let AI create a video\nBlank: Make a video from scratch or based on a script you wrote\n\nSay you choose the first option, \"URL to Video.\" Click on it and then enter your blog post URL and desired video length in the designated fields. For a teaser video, keep it under one minute.\n\nThen, choose the types of pictures to include, such as modern, hand-drawn, or 3-D illustrations. When you're done, click \"Create Video.\"\n\nNow, you’ve got your own video with captions, images, and audio content.\n\nThe audio script will appear on the right side of the page. If there's anything you want to change, simply click and edit those lines of text. You can also remove any blocks of text or add new ones.\n\nThere's also the option to add, remove, or replace images by clicking the icon next to each line of text. \n\nAnd now, you’re ready to post.\n\nFurther reading: Repurposing Content: How to Turn Articles into Videos\n\nPartner with Influencers\n\nAnother way to promote your blog is to partner with social media influencers targeting a similar audience as you.\n\nFor example, fitness bloggers might partner with prominent physical therapists, personal trainers, nutritionists, or athletes. \n\nThese aren’t your direct competitors—they’re professionals whose products or services complement yours. They have a larger following than you. And can get your blog name in front of more people.\n\nThese partnerships could look like co-authoring blog posts or appearing in each others’ vlogs. Or clear promotions of your own content on their platform.\n\nWhile it’s possible to build organic (free) relationships with influencers, you’ll usually need to compensate them for this type of promotion. This can range from free products to specific fees.\n\nCheck out our guide on how to find influencers for your brand to learn more.\n\nConsider Working with Micro-Influencers \n\nYou don't have to pay Kylie Jenner $1.84 million to mention your blog on her Instagram page. You can still engage in successful influencer marketing with a limited budget. \n\nHow?\n\nBy connecting with micro-influencers in your niche through online platforms like Modash or Klear.\n\nMicro-influencers have 1,000 to 100,000 followers. And users actually tend to trust them more than high-profile names like Jenner. Because they’re more relatable to most people.\n\nCase in point: in a 2023 survey, 69% of consumers said they were more likely to trust the recommendations of a family member, friend, or influencer than brands. But only 11% of consumers reported following celebrity influencers.\n\nTake micro-influencer Maheen (@southernchaii). One of her Instagram posts mentions a recipe from the food blog Hungry Paprikas. Maheen praised the account and encouraged over 20,000 followers to check it out. \n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s Influencer Analytics to discover influencers in your niche and gain insights into their performance. Our tool has built-in features for campaign management and competitor analysis, making it easier to optimize your marketing efforts. \n\nLeverage Email Marketing to Build a Loyal Following\n\nEmail marketing can engage your audience, increase blog traffic, and help you build trust. What's more, it allows you to share exclusive content and build an active community around your blog.\n\nAccording to Google research, newsletter subscribers visit twice as many website pages as non-subscribers, resulting in higher traffic. They're also 10 times more likely to become paid subscribers.\n\nAdd a newsletter sign-up form on your blog and social media. Include a strong call to action (CTA) to encourage readers to sign up. \n\nBelow is an example from Wendy Rowe, a makeup artist and blogger: \n\nCreate a sense of exclusivity by sharing original content in your newsletter. While you can link to existing blog posts, you don’t want to only share that. \n\nInstead, offer something different that readers can only get through your newsletter—whether it’s brand-new content, free resources, or coupon codes.\n\nAnd complement your text with images. According to GetResponse, emails with visual content have 8.37% higher open rates and 1.65% higher click-through rates than text-based newsletters.\n\nHere are some other beginner-friendly email marketing practices for your blog: \n\nSegment Your Email List to Connect With Different Groups of Readers\n\nSegment your email list’s subscribers by age, gender, location, job function, and other criteria.\n\nWith this approach, you can easily tailor your email content to each group. And personalize your emails to further strengthen readers’ emotional connection to your blog and brand.\n\nIf you send the same generic message to everyone, you risk losing their interest. For example, a newsletter offering basic fitness tips would appeal to novice gym-goers. But not to someone who's been training for years.\n\nThat's why it's crucial to segment your list and craft personalized content.\n\nEmail marketing platforms like Constant Contact, AWeber, and GetResponse have built-in tools you can use to collect and organize subscriber data.\n\nUse these insights to break your list into smaller, more targeted groups. \n\nSo, following the fitness example, you could potentially create different content for:\n\nWomen ages 19 to 24 who are just starting their fitness journey and interested in at-home workouts\nWomen ages 25 to 30 who’ve been working out for several years and want more advanced programs\nGet Organized and Pick Your Topics\n\nAim for at least one email newsletter per month or up to two newsletters per week. Sending too few emails can result in disengagement. But sending too many can lead to information overload or come off as spam. \n\nTo come up with ideas for what to include in those emails, use Topic Research. You'll find it under \"Content Marketing\" on the Semrush dashboard.\n\nTopic Research generates related subtopics and ideas based on a given topic. It also takes into account your target market and other aspects, such as trending blog topics and top-shared headlines.\n\nGet Blog Newsletter Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nFocus on One Theme at a Time\n\nStick to one main theme for each newsletter you send. Addressing too many topics at once can lead to information overload.\n\nOn a similar note, use a single CTA to avoid confusing your readers.\n\nPro tip\n\nInclude social share buttons in your newsletters so readers can easily distribute your content. It’s an opportunity to reach more people and drive sign-ups. \n\nWrite with Your Audience in Mind\n\nAdjust your tone and language for each subscriber segment. Express yourself clearly and avoid using jargon.\n\nSay you're writing a newsletter with fitness tips for women who are new to exercise. Chances are, your target audience doesn't know much about dropsets, supersets, or LISS cardio. Use terms they can understand. Along with illustrations, videos, and real-world examples.\n\nFurther reading: How to Win People Over with Compelling Email Content \n\nPromote Your Blog With Paid Advertising\n\nSometimes, it makes sense to promote your blog posts through paid advertising platforms like Google ads, Facebook ads, or LinkedIn ads.\n\nIt allows you to target very specific audiences, putting your content in front of people most likely to read it. Plus, it can generate immediate traffic, whereas SEO takes more time.\n\nFor example, you may use this option to generate exposure for a product roundup (e.g., \"The 10 Best Running Shoes for Men\") or ultimate guide where it’s relevant to promote affiliate products without coming off as too salesy. \n\nOur advice?\n\nFocus on promoting high-value pieces rather than promoting everything.\n\nAnd read this guide to paid advertising. We'll tell you all about different types of paid ads, when to use them for the best results, and how to launch your first campaign.\n\nAddress the Reader's Pain Points\n\nHighlight how your blog recognizes your readers' pain points in the ad copy.\n\nSo, you can position your blog as a solution to their needs.\n\nFor example, this blog post ad from The Mindfulness Meditation Institute emphasizes fast ways to learn mindfulness for busy readers:\n\nUse an Elevator Pitch Framework\n\nAn elevator pitch is a brief speech that outlines a concept, product, or service. It lasts around 30 seconds and should be persuasive enough to convince the audience to take action.\n\nApply this principle to your ads. Craft a short, persuasive ad that sparks curiosity and leaves the reader wanting to click to learn more. \n\nGet to the point quickly, and frame your value proposition around the problems you can solve for your audience. End with a strong CTA that clearly shows readers what to do next.\n\nConduct A/B Testing \n\nA/B testing involves comparing two versions of an ad, web page, or other form of content to determine which one performs best. \n\nFor example, you can compare two versions of an ad set or individual ad. Experiment with different subject lines, CTA buttons, ad text, fonts, or colors to find a winning combination. \n\nChange one element at a time, and then test your ads on a small scale.\n\nHarness the Power of Networking\n\nBeyond influencer marketing, connect with others in your industry by intentionally building strategic partnerships with experts, entrepreneurs, and other fellow bloggers.\n\nJoin Online Communities\n\nTo start, join relevant groups on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Reddit. Learn from other bloggers, make new friends, and promote your content where it’s appropriate. Like in dedicated weekly threads.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nFacebook\n\nThe Blog It Better Society\nASelfGuru - Biz Blog Community\nBlogging Supporting Bloggers\nContent Writers and Bloggers\nBlogger Round-Up Requests \n\nLinkedIn\n\nDigital Marketing\nSmall Business Network by Entrepreneurs HQ\nGlobal Blogger Network\nGuest Posting, Link Building, and Blogger Outreach \n\nReddit\n\nr/Blogging\nr/Bloggers\nr/BloggersCommunity\nAsk to Collaborate\n\nMessage other bloggers in related niches to see if you could partner on original content.\n\nThis kind of partnership helps both of you reach a larger audience and gain exposure. It's also a good way to find inspiration, keep your blog current, and grow your social media following.\n\nFor example, if you run a blog about healthy eating, you could contact fitness or lifestyle bloggers. Or collaborate with other food bloggers. \n\nThat’s what Laura Wright (@thefirstmess) and Luay Ghafari (@urbanfarmandkitchen) did in February 2023 when she wrote a forward to his cookbook. \n\nOther collaborations can include: \n\nCo-authoring a series of blog posts\nGuest posting on each other's blogs\nLinking to their relevant content (and vice versa)\nAppearing in social media content together\n\nPro tip\n\nLeave meaningful comments on relevant blogs in your niche to build rapport with their owners. Be sincere and authentic in mentioning what you like about your content.\n\nMake It Easy to Promote Your Blog With Semrush\n\nBuilding a successful blog isn’t just about writing awesome content.
