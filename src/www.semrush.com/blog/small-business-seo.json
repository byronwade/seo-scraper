Even with limited time and resources.\n\nBelow, we’ve provided concrete, actionable steps to get you started with small business search engine optimization.\n\nWhat Is Small Business SEO?\n\nSmall business SEO is the process of optimizing your website and online presence to improve traffic from Google and other search engines.\n\nThis means bringing more of the right people to your website: potential customers, clients, and leads.\n\nSmall business SEO is simply a subset of general SEO. But with a more targeted approach and fewer resources.\n\nAnd if you’re a small business with a physical location, an emphasis on local search results, too.\n\nSmall Business SEO vs. Local SEO\n\nSmall business SEO and local SEO are related. But they’re not the same thing.\n\nLocal SEO can help any business, large or small, that has a physical location.\n\nBut small business SEO is just for small businesses, whether they have a physical location or not.\n\nWith that said, small businesses often have physical locations and need local SEO, so we’ll cover both in the tips below. \n\nBenefits of SEO for Small Business\n\nThe benefits of SEO for small businesses include the following:\n\nIncreased Awareness\n\nWith more visibility in the SERPs, more people will see your listing and become aware of your business.\n\nIncreased awareness can lead to more business over time.\n\nIncreased Traffic\n\nAs you optimize your online presence with SEO, you can get more traffic to your website, social media pages, and Google Business Profile.\n\nAs you get more traffic, you’ll have the opportunity to turn that traffic into clients or customers.\n\nConnect With Your Target Audience Early \n\nSEO provides the opportunity to reach your target audience early in their buyer journey. \n\nBy providing quality content that addresses pain points users may be experiencing early on, you can connect with your target audience and garner trust in your brand.\n\nFor example, while Semrush offers a wide range of powerful SEO tools, we’ve provided this article to help you with small business SEO before you even consider paying for SEO tools.\n\nCompetitive Advantage\n\nBy ranking higher in search results and increasing your online visibility, you can reach more people and generate more leads and sales.\n\nThis can help you compete with larger companies in your industry and strengthen your foothold in the marketplace.\n\nYou’re Open 24/7\n\nYour target customers don’t live their lives nine-to-five. They have needs and problems and may look for solutions at all hours of the day.\n\nWith an optimized online presence, your business can be an option for them whenever they need it. \n\nIt’s Free\n\nUnlike traditional marketing strategies that rely on upfront investment and ongoing costs, small businesses can leverage SEO for free.\n\nIt only requires time and effort.\n\nIf you’re willing to put in the time and effort, SEO is a cost-effective marketing strategy that can reap long-term benefits for your business.\n\n14 SEO Tips for Small Businesses\n\nHere are 14 tips that will help you leverage effective SEO for your small business.\n\n1. Set Up Google Analytics and Google Search Console\n\nGoogle Analytics and Google Search Console are fundamental tools for tracking your SEO efforts and monitoring your progress. \n\nYou’ll need to first gain a baseline understanding of your current traffic and engagement metrics to know whether any SEO efforts are working. \n\nYou’ll also need to continue to monitor this data over time to understand how you're doing, track your progress, and know which changes have had positive effects on your business.\n\nFortunately, Google provides these solutions for free.\n\nAnd they connect with your pre-existing website using a few lines of code. (Don’t worry—it’s easy.) \n\nGoogle Analytics is an analytics platform that provides in-depth data on traffic, how users engage with your website, conversions, user demographics, and much more. \n\nGoogle Analytics is an integral tool for tracking your progress and understanding your users. \n\nFurther reading: How to Set Up Google Analytics\n\nGoogle Search Console is a dashboard that provides data and information on how your site appears in Google Search.\n\nIt will also provide data on any issues Google has with your website and allow you to submit fixes, sitemaps, and other important information. \n\nWhile Google Analytics is important for understanding your users and how they interact with your site, Google Search Console is key for understanding how Google views your site and how it performs in the SERPs.\n\nFurther reading: How to Add Google Search Console to Your Website\n\n2. Set Up Your Google Business Profile\n\nA Google Business Profile is absolutely essential if you’re a local business that serves customers in a specific geographic area.\n\nSuch local businesses include restaurants, physical stores, law firms, doctor offices, dental offices, electricians, mechanics, and many more.\n\nGoogle Business Profile is a free tool that influences how your business appears on Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Shopping. \n\nIt’s basically a profile you can set up on Google to help users find and learn about your business.\n\nWith a Google Business Profile, you can gain search visibility and garner and respond to reviews.\n\nYou can also share important business information with customers, such as your phone number, email address, and business hours. \n\nUsers will see your listing when they search for terms related to your local business.\n\nAdditionally, Google Business Profile accounts have access to analytics and data.\n\nThe platform provides data on profile views, calls, messages, how many times people searched for your business, and more.\n\nYou can use this data to further optimize your profile. \n\nFurther reading: How to Set Up Your Google Business Profile\n\n3. Do Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research is the foundation of any small business SEO strategy.\n\nYou’ll use it to ideate content, optimize your pages, build a site structure, and even curate your Google Business Profile listing.\n\nKeywords are words and phrases users type into Google search. \n\nKeywords are important for SEO because they tell you exactly what people are searching for and the words used to find it.\n\nYou can use these keywords to optimize your website so that both Google and your potential customers know that your business can provide what they are looking for. \n\nTo do keyword research, write down a list of terms that you would expect people to search for when trying to find a business like yours.\n\nThen open the Keyword Overview tool and enter the terms you just wrote down.\n\nClick “Search.”\n\nThe Keyword Overview tool will provide information on each of the keywords you entered. \n\nThis information includes the number of monthly searches of each term, its search intent, and its keyword difficulty (how hard it will be to rank in the top 10 for that term in Google search results). \n\nTypically, higher search volumes mean greater difficulty.\n\nSo when first getting started, you may want to choose lower-volume keywords with lower difficulty. \n\nYou can add these keywords to a list to begin building out a keyword plan.\n\nOnce you’ve started to build out your list, you can take your keyword research a step further with the Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nYou can use this tool to generate more keywords related to your business.\n\nOpen the tool and enter any of the main keywords you've identified.\n\nFor example, if you run a sushi restaurant in Chicago, you might enter “sushi chicago.”\n\nClick “Search.”\n\nYou'll receive a list of keyword ideas that are related to the main search term you entered.\n\nAdd any relevant terms to your keyword list.\n\nYou’ll use this list later to plan out your site's structure, content, and optimizations. \n\nSince we’re looking at a local business (e.g., a sushi restaurant in Chicago), it’s valuable to analyze the keyword data that’s specific to that city.\n\nTo do that, head to the Keyword Overview tool, enter your keyword, and select your location from the drop-down menu.\n\nNow, you’ll see city-specific keyword data for your chosen keyword. Such as keyword difficulty, search intent, local search volume, competitive density, and cost-per-click (CPC).\n\nThese metrics will give you a good baseline of how difficult it is to rank locally for your target keyword. And how costly it would be to run a Google Ads campaign.\n\nFurthermore, you’ll get an even better understanding of the local market with the SERP analysis in the same report.\n\nThis shows you which competitor webpages are ranking for your keywords. And how authoritative those pages are.\n\nIt also shows you which SERP features (such as images, sitelinks, People Also Ask, etc.) your local rivals rank for—which we’ll dive into in our next tip.\n\nFurther reading: How to Do Keyword Research for SEO\n\n4. Analyze SERP Competitors\n\nBy analyzing your SERP competitors, you can find additional keywords, understand the kind of content your users want to see, and gain a broader understanding of the online landscape for your business.\n\nBut what are SERP competitors?\n\nYour SERP competitors are the websites you’ll be competing with for visibility on the SERPs. \n\nThey may or may not be your offline competitors. \n\nTake a look at the SERP for “sushi in chicago.”\n\nThe top three results in the map pack (labeled in the image as “Places”) are sushi restaurants. These may be your actual offline competitors.\n\nHowever, after that, the results seem to be restaurant review websites and blogs.\n\nRegardless of which sites you find in the SERPs, you need to know what you’re up against so you can tailor your approach accordingly.\n\nYou can analyze these sites for how they use keywords, how they structure their sites, and what kind of content they are creating.\n\nYou’ll need this information when it comes time to start optimizing your own site. \n\nWhen analyzing SERP competitors for your target keywords, note the following:\n\nAre they ranking their homepage or a dedicated page?\nHow are keywords used on the page?\nHow do they structure their websites? (Hint: Look at their header navigation menus.)\nWhat kind of content do they have?\nWho do they seem to be targeting (e.g., children, families, businesspeople, etc.)?\n\nYou can take your SERP competitor analysis a step further with Semrush’s Organic Research tool. \n\nSimply enter the URL of one of your competitors and click “Search.”\n\nIn the Organic Research dashboard, you can see how many keywords they rank for, how much monthly traffic they get from Google, and their top SEO keywords.\n\nIf you click on the “Positions” tab, you can see all the keywords your competitor ranks for. \n\nMany of these keywords are ones you should also target. \n\nIn the above example, we can see that this small sushi business brings in more than 4.5% of its organic traffic every month with the keyword “sushi restaurant.”\n\nThis may not seem like a lot, but it’s 4.5% of an estimated 23,400 visitors every month from one keyword.\n\nThat’s over 1,000 potential customers.\n\nEvery month. \n\nIt’s also only one of near 1,900 keywords they rank for. \n\nYou get the idea. \n\nSERP competitor analysis is a crucial step in optimizing your own website.\n\nFurther reading: How to Do SERP Analysis\n\n5. Review Your Site Structure\n\nSite structure is the way your pages and content are grouped together.\n\nIt determines how easily search engines and users can navigate your website. \n\nThis includes your header and footer menus, as well as your URL structure and how you link to pages within your site. \n\nWith a bad site structure, your pages may not rank well. And your users will never find them.\n\nThis is bad for SEO. And bad for business.\n\nA good site structure enables users (and search engines) to easily navigate your website and reach every page in four clicks or fewer. \n\nTo review your website’s current structure, pretend you’re a user looking for specific information on your website. \n\nCan you find what you need easily? \n\nIs anything confusing, in the wrong place, or hidden?\n\nIf you notice any problems with your website structure, you should consider mapping out a new one.\n\nKeyword research is often key to determining the ideal website structure.\n\nBut what’s most important is that your website’s structure is clear, easy, and logical.\n\nFor our sushi restaurant in Chicago, we could stick with a simple structure. With the following items in the header menu:\n\nMenu page\nAbout page\nOnline reservations page\nContact page\nBlog where we could post articles or news about our business (optional)\nGallery of images (optional)\n\nIf we have multiple locations for our restaurant, we can include individual pages for each location, using URLs like the following:\n\nsushi-restaurant.com/lincoln-park/\nsushi-restaurant.com/michigan-ave/\nsushi-restaurant.com/wicker-park/\n\nOr if you're operating in a single location but have multiple aspects to your business, you may go with something like:\n\nsushi-restaurant.com/omakase/\nsushi-restaurant.com/catering/\nsushi-restaurant.com/take-out-bento/\n\nMap out the pages you need based on your keyword research and SERP analysis. And carefully consider how your customers engage with your business.\n\nFurther reading: How to Build Your Website Architecture for SEO\n\n6. Add Schema Markup\n\nSchema markup is specially formatted data you can add to your code to provide search engines with additional information about your page. \n\nUsing schema markup can also help you appear in special results in the SERPs called rich results.\n\nIn the example below, Google serves up rich results for Target.\n\nThese rich results are not only helpful for users, but they provide Target with more SERP real estate, as they push the rest of the results down.\n\nThis will likely result in more clicks for Target.\n\nThere are schema types for:\n\nLocal businesses\nRestaurants\nDentists\nFlorists\nHospitals\nHotels\nNail salons\nReal estate agents\nAnd more\n\nWhile schema is an advanced SEO concept, there are simple ways to implement it on your website using third-party tools and plugins. \n\nFurther reading: What Is Schema Markup & How to Implement Structured Data\n\n7. Optimize On-Page Elements\n\nOptimizing on-page elements, such as titles, meta descriptions, and headers, is one of the quickest ways to get SEO wins for small businesses. \n\nTitles\n\nTitles, also referred to as title tags and meta titles, are website elements that denote the title of a page.\n\nThey’re most commonly seen and used in search results. \n\nIn the example below, “Hamachi Sushi Bar - Chicago” is the title. \n\nTitles can be optimized with keywords to influence ranking in the SERPs. \n\nAnd because they’re the first thing users notice in the search results, you should optimize them for clickability and compellingness.\n\nFor Hamachi Sushi Bar, a better title for their homepage—one that leverages keywords and will entice users to click—might look like this:\n\nEnsure every page on your website has a unique, compelling title.\n\nHere are some more best practices for writing title tags:\n\nTitles should be 55 to 60 characters long\nUse your target keywords\nDescribe your page content clearly and accurately\nHelp people understand what they will find on the page\nEntice users to click \nUse your company name or brand wisely\nKeep it simple\n\nFurther reading: What Is a Title Tag & How to Optimize Title Tags for Google\n\nMeta Descriptions\n\nMeta descriptions are website elements that tell Google and your users what your pages are about. \n\nThey’re a great opportunity to tell users a little bit about your pages and encourage them to click on your result.\n\nThey can be found in the SERPs, just under the title. \n\nIn the example below, it seems Kamehachi forgot to write a meta description, so Google pulled bits of text from the page in order to give users some information. \n\nThis is a missed opportunity for Kamehachi. \n\nA better, more compelling meta description for Kamehachi’s homepage might look like this: \n\nEnsure every page on your site has a unique meta description that accurately reflects the contents of the page. \n\nAnd ideally, leverage keywords from your research.\n\nHere are some best practices for writing meta descriptions for your small business:\n\nMeta descriptions should be one or two sentences and 140 to 160 characters long\nInclude one or two keywords\nAdd a call to action if it’s relevant\nMeta descriptions should be meaningful and descriptive of your content\nTarget an emotion\n\nFurther reading: What Is a Meta Description & How to Write One\n\nHeaders\n\nHeaders are elements that denote the structure and hierarchy of content. \n\nThat just means headers are the differently sized and/or styled text that indicates different sections of a piece of content.\n\nHeader values used on websites are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6.\n\nH1s are typically the biggest and most important.\n\nThey usually serve as the on-page title of the page. \n\nIn the example below, taken from the Semrush blog, we can see two headers, an H2 and an H3:\n\nHeaders like these make up the structure of a page or piece of content. And provide Google (and users) with more context on what your page is about. \n\nGoogle recommends using headers to structure your content.\n\nAnd the search engine appears to assign more weight to keywords used in headers. \n\nLeverage keywords in headers to better connect your page with the terms your target audience is searching for. \n\nJust make sure your headers still read naturally and provide a logical structure for your page.\n\nThe following are some best practices for using headers:\n\nUse an H1 for the main heading (or on-page title) of every page\nInclude keywords naturally\nUse H2s through H6s to break up your page content and provide a logical structure\nWrite for your target users\nUse them to summarize the content contained in their sections \n\nFurther reading: What Is an H1 Tag? Why It Matters & Best Practices for SEO\n\n8. Create Content to Connect With Your Customers\n\nCreating content is a great way to bring more traffic to your website. It can help you reach potential customers and turn them into actual customers.\n\nThe idea is for users to find your content in the SERPs, engage with it, and keep you in mind when they are ready to make a purchase or become a customer. \n\nBut to create effective content for small business SEO, you need to understand your target audience and what they want to see.\n\nThis is where your keyword research is beneficial.\n\nYou can use keyword research to create pages that target important keywords for your business. \n\nFor example, we used the Keyword Magic Tool to find keywords that included the word “sushi.”\n\nUsing this cursory research, we can create several articles for our sushi restaurant that target keywords like “what is sushi,” “is sushi healthy,” and “is sushi gluten free.” \n\nThousands of people search these questions every month. \n\nIf you can rank for these terms, you can bring a lot of potential customers to your website. \n\nYou’ll also be adding a way to educate and connect with your potential customers.\n\nUse your unique experience and expertise to create high-quality, informative content that provides value to your audience.\n\nIncorporate keywords and use headers to structure your content.\n\nAdd visuals like images and videos to make your content more engaging.\n\nYou can also promote your content by sharing it on social media and other channels to bring in even more traffic.\n\nGreat content that connects with your target audience can bring traffic to your website and continue to do so long after it’s published. \n\nFurther reading: Content Marketing for Small Business\n\n9. Find and Fix Basic SEO Issues\n\nMany technical aspects of SEO could negatively affect your rankings and visibility in the SERPs.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nPages Google can’t find or crawl\nBroken links\nSlow site speed\nSitemap errors\nDuplicate content\nWeb security issues\nSchema implementation errors\nAnd more\n\nThese issues are often difficult to diagnose and resolve for small businesses with limited time and resources.\n\nFortunately, tools like Semrush’s Site Audit tool can do a lot of the work for you. \n\nSimply type in your domain and click “Start Audit” to begin setting up an audit for your website.\n\nThe next page presents options you can use to fine-tune your audit. \n\nHowever, as a small business, you probably don’t have to worry about them for now. \n\nSo click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nOnce it’s ready, click on your project to see the results of your audit. \n\nThe Site Audit dashboard provides a number of issues it found with your site.\n\nYou can click on the errors, warnings, or notices to get more detailed information on them. As well as suggestions on how to fix them.\n\nWork your way through the issues and fix what you can. \n\nEven if you can’t fix everything at the moment, any improvements you make will only improve your SEO and search visibility.\n\nFurther reading: How to Perform an SEO Audit\n\n10. Create Relevant Online Listings for Your Business\n\nOne of Google’s core ranking factors is backlinks. These are links on other websites that point to your website. \n\nThey are important for Google because they serve as votes of confidence in your website.\n\nBasically, a link to your website tells Google your site is a good resource.\n\nThe more backlinks you get, and the bigger and better the sites you get them from, the better it looks to Google.\n\nAnd Google will rank your site higher as a result. \n\nBut getting websites to link to yours isn’t easy.\n\nIt takes time and skill.\n\nStill, small businesses need backlinks to rank well in the SERPs. \n\nLuckily, a simple way to get links to your website is to submit your business to relevant directories.\n\nNot only will you build relevant links to your website from each directory profile, but you’ll also appear on directory pages that rank on Google. \n\nFor example, the following are good places to start submitting your business listing:\n\nGoogle Business Profile (as outlined in tip No. 2 above)\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nBing Places for Business\nYelp for Business\nApple Maps\n\nThere are many other industry-specific business listings to seek out and consider. \n\nLinks from these directories will help with your SEO efforts. And you may also get traffic directly from these directories.\n\nJust ensure that the business name, address, and phone number (we refer to these collectively as NAPs) you submit are accurate and consistent. (More on this later.)\n\nFurther reading: Link Building for SEO\n\n11. Ask Your Suppliers and Business Associations to Link to Your Website\n\nAnother proven link building strategy that nearly every small business can execute is to reach out to suppliers and business associations and ask them to link to you.\n\nIf you sell or use another business’s products, reach out to them and ask whether they’d be willing to link to your site. \n\nThey probably have a “where to buy” or “stockists” section on their own website.\n\nThey may also have a testimonials section, where they’d most likely be willing to feature you in exchange for a testimonial. \n\nAlternatively, if you sell products that other companies use as part of their own offerings, you could ask them to link to your website in a section that describes where they source materials.\n\nThey may also have a section that outlines their business partners. \n\nGet creative and try to think of more ways you can get links to your website on other websites related to your industry. \n\nFurther reading: How to Get Backlinks\n\n12. Monitor Local Listings\n\nThe accuracy and consistency of your important business information (NAP, or name, address, and phone number) is vital.\n\nIf this information is inaccurate somewhere—say, on your website or on your Google Business Profile—potential customers won’t be able to reach you. And you’ll miss out on business.\n\nUsers will feel the pain, too. They’ll have found a business they like, only to be unable to reach it.\n\nGoogle recognizes this and places great importance on the accuracy and consistency of your local listings—specifically your business name, address, and phone number.\n\nIf your business has two different phone numbers or addresses listed out there on the internet somewhere, Google will probably rank you lower. \n\nAfter all, Google wants to serve up the best, most helpful results.\n\nBut it doesn’t know which of these listings is the right one.\n\nWhy would it serve up a result that may have inaccurate business information?\n\nSo it’s essential to monitor your local listings (that is, everywhere online that your business is mentioned) and ensure that they’re all up to date and consistent. \n\nBut as your number of listings grows, keeping track of them all can become increasingly complicated.\n\nSemrush’s Listing Management tool provides a convenient solution to this problem.\n\nSimply type in your business name and select it from the options.\n\nIn the example below, we looked into the local listings of Sushi-san, a sushi restaurant in Chicago. \n\nUnfortunately, Sushi-san has a few issues to resolve, including 34 inaccurate or inconsistent listings. \n\nThe Listing Management tool will not only show you exactly which listings are problematic and how, but it will also help you fix them. \n\nFurther reading: Listing Management\n\n13. Encourage & Respond to Reviews \n\nReviews affect your Google ranking and whether people will trust your business.\n\nThe more reviews you have, the better it is for business. \n\nIn fact, the number of reviews can be even more important than your rating.\n\n(Of course, you should try to keep your rating as high as possible, too.)\n\nIn the example below, we searched for “sushi in chicago.” \n\nAs you can see, Juno Sushi Chicago ranks above Sushi Suite 202, despite having an inferior rating. \n\nThis may be because Juno Sushi Chicago has more reviews. At least partly.\n\nEncourage your clients and customers to leave ratings and reviews. \n\nAnd respond to the reviews—whether they’re positive or negative. \n\nPeople love to see businesses that are attentive and care about their customers.\n\nGoogle also appears to reward businesses that respond to reviews, as it indicates freshness and activity. \n\nFurther reading: Online Reputation Management\n\n14. Track Your Rankings\n\nTracking your ranking and performance for important keywords is crucial for properly attributing your SEO efforts. \n\nAfter all, you want to know that your work is paying off, right? \n\nGoogle Analytics and Google Search Console can provide a lot of valuable data.\n\nBut they can’t tell you how well you rank for specific keywords.\n\nThis information can help you understand which of your optimization techniques are working. And which need further refinement.\n\nSemrush’s Position Tracking tool provides detailed information on how you rank for your keywords. Including local results. \n\nIt also provides traffic estimates and historical data. So you can see how rankings have changed over time. \n\nAdditionally, you can track your rankings in specific cities and even neighborhoods. \n\nThis gives you unparalleled insights into your local rankings and how your customers are seeing your results on Google.\n\nTo get started, open the Position Tracking tool and click “Create project.”\n\nIn the pop-up window, enter your domain name, give your project a name, and click “Create project.”\n\nThen choose your location and language. And add your business name as its show in the local map pack.\n\nClick “Continue To Keywords.”\n\nAdd the keywords you want to track to the “Keywords” field.\n\nClick “Add keywords to campaign.” Then click “Start Tracking.”\n\nIn the Position Tracking dashboard, you’ll be able to view ranking data on specific keywords, ranking distributions, search visibility, and even “share of voice” related to your competitors. \n\nMonitor your ranking data over time. And make SEO tweaks to pages that aren’t performing as well as you think they should be. \n\nFurther reading: How to Track Your Google Rankings\n\nLeverage SEO for Small Business to Drive Ongoing Success\n\nYou can do many of the tasks outlined above in a single day. And for free.\n\nAnd if you do everything on this list, you’ll probably see some great results.\n\nBut like most worthwhile endeavors, you’ll only see long-term benefits from SEO if you keep at it. \n\nSEO is a process.\n\nYou need to keep creating great content for your users.\n\nKeep optimizing your titles, meta descriptions, and headers.\n\nAnd keep tracking your traffic and rankings.\n\nWith a bit of persistence, you can achieve long-term success with small business SEO.\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
