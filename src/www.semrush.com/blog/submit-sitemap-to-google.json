Which is good for your SEO.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll share:\n\nHow to submit your sitemap to Google \nWhat an XML sitemap should contain\nHow to detect and fix issues with your sitemap\n\nLet's dive in. \n\nNote: If you want to learn more about sitemaps first, read our beginner's guide to website sitemaps.\n\nHow to Submit a Sitemap to Google\n\nGoogle allows you to submit your sitemap directly in its free tool called Google Search Console (GSC), formerly known as Google Webmaster Tools.\n\nNote: If you don't have a GSC account, you'll have to create one. Read our guide to Google Search Console to learn how to set it up.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to submitting a sitemap to Google:\n\nLog in to Google Search Console\nGo to the ‘Sitemaps’ Report\nFind the URL of Your Sitemap\nAdd a New Sitemap\nStep 1: Log in to Google Search Console\n\nFirst, log in to your Google Search Console account.\n\nThen, in the top left corner, select the website for which you want to submit a sitemap. (In case you have more than one property under the same account.)\n\nStep 2: Go to the ‘Sitemaps’ Report\n\nIn the left sidebar menu, you'll find a “Sitemaps” report in the “Indexing” section. Go there.\n\nThis is where you can manage all your sitemaps. It contains two main sections:\n\n“Add a new sitemap”\n“Submitted sitemaps”\n\nWe'll focus on the first one. \n\nStep 3: Find the URL of Your Sitemap\n\nThere are two basic types of sitemaps: XML sitemaps and HTML sitemaps. HTML sitemaps are not used for SEO purposes, so we'll focus on an XML sitemap here. \n\nHere are some effective ways to find your XML sitemap: \n\nTry the most common placement. There's a high chance your XML sitemap will be located at https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml.\nUse a search operator. If you search Google for “site:yourdomain.com filetype:xml,” you should find the location of your sitemap.\nCheck your robots.txt file. Your robots.txt file (located at https://yourdomain.com/robots.txt) may contain a link to your sitemap. \n\nIf you don't have an XML sitemap, you'll need to create one. Check out our guide on how to create an XML sitemap.\n\nStep 4: Add a New Sitemap\n\nNow, you can add your sitemap to the “Add a new sitemap” section of the “Sitemaps” report.\n\nJust paste the URL and click “Submit.”\n\nYou'll see a message confirming that your sitemap has been successfully submitted.\n\nAfter some time, you'll see your sitemap in the list of “Submitted sitemaps.” It contains information about when the sitemap was submitted, when it was last read, and how many pages Google discovered in it.\n\nMost importantly, it will show you the status of your sitemap submission. A green “Success” status means there are no issues.\n\nIf you see a “Couldn't fetch” or “Has errors” status, you'll need to follow the report's suggestions on how to fix the issues.\n\nJump to the \"Sitemap Issues\" section of this post to learn more about possible issues and how to detect them. \n\nWhat Should a Sitemap Contain?\n\nYou should use your sitemap to indicate important pages you want search engines to index and show in their search results. \n\nHere is the information your XML sitemap should contain:\n\nURLs you want to have indexed. There's no point in including pages that have a “noindex” tag, as you don't want those pages indexed.\nThe “lastmod” value. Include information about when the page was last updated.\nThe “hreflang” value for local variants of the URLs. If your pages have localized versions, you can indicate them in the sitemap.\n\nAnd here is some information you should not include in your sitemap:\n\nNon-canonical pages: If there are multiple (duplicate or near-duplicate) versions of the same page, only include the one that has a canonical tag.\n3xx or 4xx pages: If a URL returns a 4xx status code (client error) or a 3xx status code (redirect), don't include it in your XML sitemap.\nThe “changefreq” and “priority” values: Google ignores these values, so it is a waste of time to use them in your sitemap.\n\nHere’s some good news: If you use one of the well-known content management systems (CMSs) like WordPress, Wix, etc., for your website, or if you generated your sitemap with a sitemap generator, you probably don't have to worry about any of these items. \n\nYour CMS (or the generator you used) will likely adhere to these best practices and automatically include everything you need in your sitemap. \n\nFurther reading: How to Create a Sitemap for a WordPress Website\n\nHow to Detect and Fix Sitemap Issues\n\nTo find and fix the most serious issues related to your sitemap, you can conduct a technical SEO audit of your website. Semrush's Site Audit tool is a great place to start. \n\nStart by creating a free Semrush account. \n\nOnce you've signed up, follow these steps:\n\nCreate a project in the “Projects” section\nGo to Site Audit and select your domain\nIn the “Site Audit Settings” window, configure your audit settings (follow this step-by-step setup guide if you're not sure about something) \nHit the “Start Site Audit” button\n\nA free account allows you to crawl up to 100 pages. Once the audit is finished, you’ll get an overview of your website's health, detailed reports about various aspects, and—most importantly—a list of all the issues.\n\nGo to the “Issues” tab and search for “sitemap.” A list of all the possible issues related to your sitemap will appear.\n\nIf your website has an issue, you can click the link with the number of affected pages. \n\nThis will open a new report with a full list of affected pages.\n\nBy clicking the “Why and how to fix it” link, you can see the detailed description of the issue and follow the instructions on how to fix it.\n\nAfter you've fixed all the sitemap-related issues, you can run another audit to make sure everything is resolved.\n\nNote: TheGoogle Search Console “Sitemaps” report will also inform you if there are issues with the sitemap you've submitted. Google's guidelines include the full error list that covers most of the issues GSC may detect. \n\nCommon Sitemap Issues\n\nHere are some common sitemap issues that the Site Audit tool can detect:\n\nSitemap not found. Your website does not have a sitemap, or the sitemap is not located in the expected location.\nSitemap.xml not indicated in robots.txt. Your website's robots.txt file does not indicate the location of the sitemap.xml file.\nIncorrect pages found in a sitemap. Your sitemap contains URLs that are not supposed to be in a sitemap (e.g., redirects, non-canonical URLs, etc.)\nSitemap has format errors. There are errors in the format of your sitemap file, such as missing XML tags.\nSitemap files are too large. Your sitemap is too large, exceeding the size limits set by Google.\n\nFurther reading: How to Perform a Technical SEO Audit\n\nFind and Fix Sitemap Errors\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nFAQs\nDo I Have to Submit a Sitemap to Google?\n\nNo. Google’s bots will crawl your website eventually. Submitting a sitemap just speeds up the process.\n\nHowever, uploading your sitemap to Google Search Console is still considered the SEO best practice. Since it will only take you a couple of seconds, there is no reason not to do it. \n\nHow Can I Remove My Sitemap from Google?\n\nSometimes, it is just easier to remove the old sitemap and upload a new one. Especially if the site architecture has changed significantly. Or if the old sitemap has many errors. \n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to remove a sitemap from Google:\n\nLog in to your Google Search Console account\nIf you own multiple websites, select the website for which you want to remove the sitemap in the top left corner\nClick “Sitemaps” under the “Indexing” section of the left sidebar menu\nIn the “Submitted sitemaps” section, click the line with the sitemap you want to remove \nClick the three-dot menu icon next in the top right corner. Then click “Remove sitemap.” \nConfirm the removal by clicking the “Remove” button in the pop-up window that appears\n\nWait for Google to process your request. \n\nAlternatively, you can just delete the sitemap file from your website. Google will eventually stop checking the file if it is not available for a longer period of time. \n\nCan I Use Multiple Sitemaps?\n\nYes. For example, you can use different sitemaps for different types of content (e.g., a sitemap for pages, a sitemap for posts, a sitemap for videos, etc.)\n\nAlso, you'll have to use more sitemaps if your sitemap file is more than 50MB (uncompressed) or contains more than 50,000 URLs. (Both are technical limitations for a single sitemap file set by Google.)\n\nIf you use multiple sitemaps, you need to create a sitemap index file. A sitemap index is basically a sitemap that contains all of your sitemaps. It contains the URLs of all your sitemaps. \n\nThen, you can follow the instructions in this guide and submit the sitemap index URL to Google Search Console the same way you would do with a regular sitemap. \n\nFind and Fix Sitemap Errors\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
