  "content": "What Is Social Media Management?\n\nSocial media management is the process of overseeing every detail related to your brand's social media presence. To grow awareness and connect with your target audience.\n\nSocial media managers are typically the individuals responsible for this. And their main tasks may include:\n\nDeveloping a social media strategy\nCreating and posting social content\nResponding to comments and messages from followers and other users\nMonitoring social channels for brand mentions and relevant conversations\nIdentifying and collaborating with influencers\nSetting up and managing paid social media advertising campaigns\nTracking key performance metrics and creating reports\nContinuously optimizing tactics based on performance data\n\nSome businesses have a dedicated social media manager or a team handling these activities. Others outsource to freelancers or social media marketing agencies.\n\nBelow, we’ll discuss why social media management is crucial for your brand, your options for social media management, and how to manage your social media presence if you opt to do it yourself.\n\nWhy Is Social Media Management Important?\n\nSocial media management ensures you’re working toward team objectives that contribute to your company’s larger goals. \n\nSpecifically, it can help with:\n\nBuilding brand awareness\nFostering community\nDriving traffic to your website\nGenerating leads\nCultivating customer loyalty\n\nLet’s say you’re looking to grow brand awareness across social media by a certain percentage. To support your business’s revenue growth goals. \n\nNow, consider that more than five billion people use social media. \n\nIf you use social media, you can tap into valuable opportunities to reach and engage your target audience (i.e., people who are likely to buy from you).\n\nFor example, Wendy’s has 3.7 million followers on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nTheir posts regularly reach hundreds of thousands of people. And generate tons of comments, shares, and likes.\n\nThey also actively respond to users. \n\nAll this creates a lot of positive attention for Wendy's. Which can drive people to their restaurants.\n\nOn the other hand, poorly managed social media accounts can send negative signals. Suggesting that a brand is out of touch or indifferent to its audience. \n\nThis perception can push potential customers toward competitors.\n\nIn short, social media management helps you maintain a positive brand image and build relationships. Which can translate to business success. \n\nIn-House vs. Outsourced Social Media Management\n\nChoosing between in-house and outsourced social media management depends on your company's needs and resources.\n\nIn-house social media management gives you complete control, makes implementing changes quick, and ensures posts and comments are always aligned with your brand. But it can take time to develop expertise, and the necessary tools and hiring can be costly.\n\nOutsourced social media management gives you immediate access to skilled professionals and frees you to focus on more pressing matters. But it removes some of your control, often involves delays, and can quickly become expensive depending on the services you need. \n\nIf you're a small business looking to grow your presence without a huge upfront investment, hiring an in-house social media manager could be a good start.\n\nBut if you need specialized knowledge or want to scale quickly, an external agency or freelancer may be a better choice.\n\nHow to Get Started with Social Media Management\n\nYou can manage social media using the tools available on the social platforms themselves. But many businesses use third-party social media management tools to consolidate their efforts in one place and gain additional insights.\n\nBelow, we’ll cover tactics for social media management success. And social media management software solutions you can use for each step.\n\nNote\n\nThe steps below are intended for those who’ve decided to go the in-house social media management route. \n\n1. Set Goals\n\nSetting social media management goals gives you direction and ensures you stay on track to reach company goals.\n\nYour goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).\n\nFor instance, rather than a vague goal like \"increase engagement,\" a SMART goal would be \"increase the average engagement rate by 20% within the next two months.\"\n\nThis clarity guides decisions about what formats to create, what topics to focus on, etc. And ensures you use your time and resources efficiently. \n\n2. Identify Your Target Audience\n\nUnderstanding your target audience can help you choose the right platforms, create compelling content, and engage with users more effectively.\n\nStart by gathering insights about your current social media followers by looking into your social media analytics. \n\nPlatforms like Meta provide audience insights. Such as age, gender, and location breakdowns.\n\nNext, use Semrush's One2Target to analyze your target audience.\n\nOpen the tool, choose your location, and enter the domains of up to five competitors. Then, click “Analyze.”\n\nCheck the \"Demographics\" tab (which you’ll reach by default) to learn about the audience’s age, gender, and location data.\n\nGo to the \"Socioeconomics\" tab to see the audience's household size, income level, employment status, and education level.\n\nFinally, click the \"Behavior\" tab to see the interests, device types, and social platforms that are most popular with this audience.\n\nUse these audience insights to prioritize your social media management efforts.\n\nFor example, if the data shows the audience is largely people between the ages of 35 and 34 who work full time and prefer YouTube, you might focus on creating short-form social videos.\n\nStreamline Audience Research\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\n3. Choose the Right Social Media Platforms\n\nYou can manage social media accounts on one or more platforms. But the right platforms for your brand depend on who you’re trying to reach. \n\nFor example, many people use Pinterest to get home decor inspiration. So it’s great for brands like IKEA. \n\nAnd they get more than 10 million views on their Pinterest boards every month (as of February 2024).\n\nWhereas lots of tech lovers hang out on Discord. So brands like Samsung are present there.\n\nRevisit the information you found in One2Target to identify the best platforms for you. And consider doing even more research into your competitors’ social media presences.\n\nTheir follower numbers give an idea of potential reach (or the total number of people who potentially see their content).\n\nWhile views, likes, comments, and shares show engagement potential.\n\nOnce you’ve created your list of potential social platforms, you need to prioritize.\n\nUse these tips to help:\n\nStart small: It’s better to manage one platform well than several platforms poorly. Start with one or two accounts and build your presence over time. To reduce the risk of spreading yourself too thin.\nPlay to your strengths: Start on platforms you’re familiar with. And stick to the content formats that suit them.\nPick similar platforms: Repurposing content across multiple platforms can save you time. The more similar the platforms you’re using, the easier this is. \nDo a trial run: As a test, create a week’s worth of content for the platform you’re considering. This should give you a good idea of the resources required.\n\nTip\n\nDo you already oversee some brand accounts? Only maintain them if they have strong potential or are already performing well. Otherwise, focus on your priority platforms first.\n\n4. Create and Optimize Your Social Media Profiles\n\nNow, it’s time to create (or optimize) your brand’s profiles.\n\nThe process differs by platform. But here are some best practices to keep in mind:\n\nChoose Appropriate Social Media Handles\n\nMany social media platforms require you to choose a handle. This is the alias your brand goes by on the platform.\n\nIntuitive and consistent handles make it easier for people to find your brand. And tag you in conversations.\n\nFor example, Semrush goes by “@semrush” on YouTube, X, Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram.\n\nCreating multiple accounts? Use Namecheckr to see what handles are available.\n\nWant to change one of your existing handles? Check out the respective social platform’s support section for guidance.\n\nUse Appealing Profile Pictures\n\nYour profile picture is the main image associated with a social media account. And consistency across profiles makes it easier for people to recognize your brand. \n\nMost businesses use their logo.\n\nIf you’re building a personal brand, you could use a high-quality headshot instead.\n\nAnd know that some platforms allow you to upload extra profile images (e.g., the header image on X).\n\nThis can also be a great way to promote your latest campaign.\n\nWrite Compelling Bios\n\nThe bio is the short description that appears on a social media profile. Which you can use to explain what your business does and why someone should follow you. \n\nFor example, Semrush’s Pinterest bio uses social proof and an emoji to grab users’ attention.\n\nAnd fill in any other fields, such as your website URL and contact details. To make it easier for social media users to learn about and engage with your brand.\n\nTry looking at your rivals’ bios for inspiration. \n\nComplete Verification Steps\n\nSocial media verification is the process of proving that your brand account is authentic. That it really belongs to you or your business (and isn’t being run by an imitator).\n\nMost social media platforms display a “Verified” badge on verified profiles. Like this:\n\nIf you can get verified, you should (just note that verification on X requires a paid plan). To build trust with users. \n\nModify Your Privacy Settings\n\nCheck each platform’s privacy settings to ensure anyone can find, follow, and contact your brand.\n\nFor example, “Public posts” are visible to people on and off X. And are eligible to appear in X search results and Google search results.\n\nMeanwhile, “Protected posts” are only visible to your X followers.\n\nTo protect (or unprotect) your posts, go to your account settings. And click “Privacy and safety” > “Audience, media and tagging.”\n\nThen click or unclick the checkbox beside “Protect your posts” and “Protect your videos.”\n\nYou can also make it easier for people to privately message you for customer service reasons. By going back to your \"Privacy and safety\" settings. And clicking on \"Direct messages.\"\n\nFrom there, you can configure who can message you under \"Allow message requests from.\" And even filter out low-quality messages.\n\nRemember to review privacy settings on all your social media accounts. If you need help, check out each platform’s support pages.\n\n5. Post High-Quality Content\n\nThe key to success on any social media platform is consistently posting high-quality content your target audience finds helpful, interesting, and/or entertaining. \n\nSo, strategically plan your social content to earn followers and turn them into loyal customers. Here’s how:\n\nCreate a Posting Strategy and Schedule\n\nDeveloping a posting strategy and schedule helps you save time and stay on track toward your goals.\n\nTo start, list the content formats available on your chosen platforms. This will help you brainstorm good ideas.\n\nFor Instagram, your list might look like this:\n\nReels (videos up to 90 seconds with an aspect ratio of 9:16)\nPhotos (aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5)\nCarousels (up to 10 videos and photos in a single post)\nStories (photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours)\n\nTip\n\nVisit the brand help center on your chosen platforms for guidance:\n \n\nX\nInstagram\nPinterest\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\n\nNext, come up with the types of content you could create for each format. Such as case studies, tutorials, or product demos. (Get more ideas from this list of social content types.)\n\nNarrow it down to the best ideas by considering why your audience will find that content valuable and how you’ll create it.\n\nKeep your notes together in a document.\n\nLet’s say you’re doing social media marketing management for the camera brand GoPro. The start of your Instagram strategy might look like this:\n\nFormat\n\n\t\n\nWhat\n\n\t\n\nWhy\n\n\t\n\nHow\n\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\n\t\n\nCustomer photo\n\n\t\n\nInspire\n\n\t\n\nAsk customers to share photos using #GoPro\n\n\n\n\nReel\n\n\t\n\nExtreme sports videos\n\n\t\n\nEntertain\n\n\t\n\nSponsor extreme sports athletes\n\n\n\n\nCarousel\n\n\t\n\nTop tips\n\n\t\n\nEducate\n\n\t\n\nUse image editing software\n\nHere’s an example of a resulting post:\n\nTo find out what content performs best in your niche, try Social Tracker (part of Semrush Social). \n\nThe “Top Content by Channel” section showcases posts with the best engagement. (From competitors’ profiles and your own.)\n\nNext, decide how often to post on each platform. And at what times.\n\nGo to the “Activity” tab for relevant social media platforms in Social Tracker to find out when your competitors post. And how engagement varies by day.\n\nAnd think about key points in your target audience’s day. For example, professionals might check LinkedIn before they start work for the day. \n\nStreamline Social Media Management\n\nwith Semrush Social\n\nGet Now →\nSet Up a Social Media Content Calendar\n\nCreating and scheduling content in advance makes it easier to accomplish the following:\n\nPrepare for upcoming events like marketing campaigns and public holidays\nMaintain a consistent posting schedule\nPost a variety of content\n\nIt also gives social media managers more time to focus on community engagement each day.\n\nThe best way to stay organized is to use a social media content calendar. Which lays out what you’ll post and when.\n\nOur free social media calendar template includes the following columns: \n\nChannel\n\n\t\n\nThe social media platform you’ll post on\n\n\n\n\nDay\n\n\t\n\nThe day of the week (to match up with the date)\n\n\n\n\nStatus\n\n\t\n\nWhether your content is planned, in progress, scheduled, or published\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\t\n\nThe publishing date\n\n\n\n\nTime\n\n\t\n\nThe publishing time\n\n\n\n\nPost Topic/Type\n\n\t\n\nThe post type and topic\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\t\n\nThe text that will be used in your post\n\n\n\n\nVisual Type\n\n\t\n\nThe specific visuals (e.g., GIFs, videos, and still images) \n\n\n\n\nVisual (Drive Link)\n\n\t\n\nLinks to your visuals once you’ve created them\n\n\n\n\nLink to Assets\n\n\t\n\nLinks to any related assets, such as blog posts or products\n\n\n\n\nLink to Published Post\n\n\t\n\nThe post URL once it’s published\n\nOnce you have your template copy, populate the calendar with ideas. \n\nTry to use a variety of content types from your social strategy. And take upcoming events into account.\n\nLet’s say you wanted to share GIFs and New Year’s Day is coming up. You could create an animated “Happy New Year” greeting for your followers.\n\nTip\n\nFor inspiration, check out our list of ways to create engaging social media content.\n\nCreate Your Posts\n\nNext, bring your ideas to life.\n\nUse AI Social Content Generator to quickly create engaging posts—including videos, images, and carousels—for various social media platforms. \n\nOpen the app and set up your account by providing details about your brand.\n\nOnce done, select \"Text to Post\" as the type of post you want to create.\n\nAdd the topic you want to focus on. And make the prompt detailed to ensure the best possible output.\n\nNext, select the type of post you need, the input and output language, and choose your own assets or let the AI do it for you. \n\nOnce you’re done, click “Generate.”\n\nThe tool will generate your social media posts. And they’ll be stored in the \"Content Library.\"\n\nOnce your posts are ready, the final step is scheduling them.\n\nSocial Poster from Semrush Social allows you to simultaneously schedule posts on up to six social media platforms: Facebook, X, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Google Business Profile. (Google Business Profile isn’t strictly a social media site. But you can post updates to your profile.)\n\nJust choose the appropriate platform(s) for your post, add your content, and click “Schedule” to choose when the post(s) should publish.\n\nCreate Social Posts\n\nwith the AI Social Content Generator\n\nTry It for Free →\n6. Engage with Your Audience\n\nIn addition to scheduling content, monitor activity in your niche using social media management platforms to identify conversations you can be a part of. And engage with trends that can boost your visibility.\n\nHere are a few ways to engage with your followers: \n\nMonitor Brand Mentions\n\nYou should know when people are talking to (or about) your brand. So you can respond effectively and make adjustments to your strategy.\n\nThis is called “social listening.”\n\nTo get alerts when someone addresses your brand directly, use the Social Inbox––a part of Semrush Social–– to see Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn mentions in one place.\n\nYou can even send responses here. It’s an efficient way to manage multiple accounts.\n\nYou can also switch on notifications in your individual social media accounts for the following:\n\nTags: Someone tagged your @handle in a post or comment\nReplies: Someone replied to your post or comment\nDirect messages: Someone messaged you privately\nComments: Someone commented on your post\nReactions: Someone reacted (e.g., “Liked”) to your post or comment\n\nAnd anything else that’s relevant on the platform.\n\nTo know when someone mentions your brand without tagging, get automatic updates with the Media Monitoring app. \n\nFor example, here’s a report for Amazon that includes brand mentions on TikTok:\n\nThe app also indicates whether mentions have positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Which helps you determine whether to intervene—and how.\n\nAlways respond to negative comments first. Addressing issues quickly, politely, and effectively can prevent them from escalating.\n\nResolve private and complex matters via direct message (or another private channel).\n\nIf someone posts something positive, responding (or reacting) can strengthen your relationship with them. And draw others’ attention to their praise.\n\nLike Robinhood did here:\n\nTip\n\nFor in-depth advice, enroll in Semrush’s free social listening course.\n\nJoin and Start Conversations\n\nTo keep track of conversations in your niche, follow competitors and influencers. Who you can find by searching relevant keywords on each platform.\n\nAnd subscribe to relevant topics or hashtags, if possible. \n\nFor example, go to “More” > “Topics” on X. And click the “+” icon on any topics you’re interested in.\n\nThen, take some time each day to identify major talking points (and popular posts) in your feed. And get involved when you can add value.\n\nOn TikTok, many brands comment on other users’ videos (especially those going viral). To gain exposure and build a personable brand image.\n\nBut start conversations, too.\n\nSimple questions and prompts can boost engagement and get people talking. And references to trending topics show you’re part of the community. \n\nOn TikTok, brands tap into trending sounds and memes to generate engagement. The site’s Creative Center can help you find what’s hot.\n\nAmplify Others\n\nSharing someone else’s content makes them more likely to engage with your post. Which can get you in front of their audience to grow brand awareness.\n\nThey might even return the favor at a later date. By sharing your content from their account.\n\nFor the best results, amplify influencers in your niche. Meaning people with a target audience you want to tap into.\n\nRepost their content alongside your commentary. Or, share content from elsewhere (e.g., blog posts) and tag the creator.\n\nWe recommend following these guidelines when amplifying someone else’s content:\n\nShare content from creators who make sense for your brand (i.e., creators in a similar niche or creators who directly mention your brand or product)\nAmplify a variety of creators\nContinue to dedicate most of your time and resources to producing original content\n7. Expand Your Reach with Ads\n\nSocial media advertising allows you to reach a targeted audience beyond your organic followers on the platforms you’re already using. Putting you in front of more people who are likely to be interested in what you offer.\n\nOne simple way to get started is by boosting your regular social media posts.\n\nCreate a regular post. And then pay to “boost” its visibility in more people’s feeds. Which can help you achieve campaign goals with content you already have.\n\nThese \"boosted\" posts have a \"Sponsored\" or “Promoted” label to signify that they’re ads:\n\nYou can also create dedicated ads.\n\nBefore you get started, gain some inspiration from competitors’ campaigns using the AdClarity app. It shows you:\n\nWhich platforms they’re advertising on\nWhich ad formats they’re using\nHow much they’re spending\nHow many impressions they’re getting\nWhich of their ads perform best\n\nUse this information to inform your own campaigns.\n\nNow, here’s an overview of some popular platforms and the format and targeting options for each:\n\nSee Competitors' Ad Campaign Data\n\nWith the AdClarity App\n\nTry For Free →\nMeta Ads\n\nFacebook and Instagram offer a range of ad options:\n\nImage and video ads in users’ feeds and in stories\nCarousel ads with multiple images or videos\nCollection ads that showcase products\nMessenger ads that start conversations\nAugmented reality ads that allow people to \"try on\" products\n\nYou can target Meta ads based on demographics, interests, behaviors, and other attributes. You can also create lookalike audiences that include people who share characteristics with your existing customers.\n\nX Ads\n\nX offers several ad formats, including:\n\nImage and video ads\nCarousel ads with up to six images or videos\nVertical video ads that take up the users’ full screen\nCollection ads that show a group of related offerings in a single view\n\nX's targeting options include keywords, interests, and behaviors. You can also target specific accounts' followers or create custom audiences.\n\nLinkedIn Ads\n\nLinkedIn provides ad options like:\n\nSponsored messaging sent directly to users' inboxes\nText and dynamic ads\nVideo ads\nEvent ads to promote your LinkedIn events\n\nLinkedIn lets you target based on company, job, education, interests, and other attributes. You can also upload contact lists.\n\nYouTube Ads\n\nYouTube offers several video ad formats, like:\n\nSkippable and non-skippable in-stream ads that play before, during, or after a video\nVideo discovery ads that appear in search results and next to related videos\nBumper ads—six-second, non-skippable video ads\nMasthead ads that appear at the top of the YouTube homepage\n\nYou can target YouTube ads based on demographics, interests, and behaviors. You can also show ads to people who’ve interacted with your videos or YouTube channel.\n\nTikTok Ads\n\nTikTok offers several ad types, including:\n\nIn-feed ads that appear in users' \"For You\" feeds\nTopView ads that appear when users open the app\nBranded hashtag challenge ads that encourage user participation\nBranded effect ads that allow brands to create custom filters and lenses\n\nTikTok's targeting options include demographics, interests, behaviors, and devices. You can also create custom and lookalike audiences.\n\nPinterest Ads\n\nPinterest provides ad formats like:\n\nStatic and video Pins that appear in users' feeds and search results\nCarousel ads with multiple images\nShopping ads that feature products\nApp install ads\n\nPinterest allows targeting based on interests, keywords, demographics, and customer lists. You can also retarget people who’ve engaged with your pins or website.\n\nFurther reading: A Guide to the Best Advertising Platforms for Your Business\n\n8. Collaborate with Influencers\n\nInfluencer marketing involves working with social media influencers to promote your brand. \n\nIt allows you to tap into an established audience. And associate your brand with a popular personality.\n\nInfluencers fall into three categories:\n\nMicro-influencers have fewer than 100,000 followers. They’re great for targeted campaigns because they often have a strong connection with their audiences.\nMacro-influencers have between 100,000 to 1 million followers. They help increase brand awareness due to their larger audience size.\nCelebrities have over 1 million followers and can significantly boost your brand’s visibility. Although, they’re the most expensive to partner with.\n\nUse the Influencer Analytics app to search for ideal influencers. \n\nOpen the tool, go to \"Influencer Discovery,\" and select the platform you want to focus on.\n\nNext, use filters to narrow down the list of influencers based on your requirements and budget. \n\nYou’ll then get a list of results you can review.\n\nClick on an individual influencer's profile for additional data. Including their contact details (if available).\n\nThe app also has influencer recruitment, collaboration, and analytics tools to help you run your entire influencer marketing campaign.\n\nOnce you’ve identified the influencers to partner with, reach out to them with a proposal. Here are some common collaboration types you can go with:\n\nOne-time sponsored posts: The influencer creates content featuring your product or service\nContests and giveaways: The influencer promotes a contest or giveaway featuring your product or service\nLong-term ambassadorships: The influencer consistently promote your brand over an extended period of time\n\nMicro-influencers are typically the most affordable, but some influencers are open to negotiation. Especially for long-term partnership.\n\nFurther reading: How to Find Influencers for Your Brand\n\n9. Measure Your Results\n\nMonitoring and analyzing social media results shows you what’s working and what isn’t. So you can improve your social media management and keep growing.\n\nOne key metric to monitor is audience size—the number of followers or subscribers you have on each platform.\n\nView everything at a glance (including your competitors’ follower counts) in the Social Tracker tool within Semrush Social.\n\nBut it’s also wise to focus on increasing engagement. (The number of interactions such as likes, comments, clicks, and replies.) \n\nEngagements are positive signals that you’re doing something right. And engaged followers may be more likely to become customers.\n\nMeasure your engagements in Social Tracker as well. You’ll find competitors’ data in the overview tab. Which can provide context—and give you something to aim for.\n\nTo monitor the success of individual posts, head to the “Posts” report in the “Facebook” or “Instagram” tab. Or the “Tweets” report in the “Twitter” tab.\n\nEngagement rate (“Eng. rate”) is a key metric for comparison here. (Visit our knowledge base to learn how it’s calculated.)\n\nClick on the column head to sort from highest to lowest. That way, you’ll see which posts performed best in your chosen time period. Then, look for trends in post types, hashtags, and times.\n\nFindings here will help you refine your content strategy. \n\nLet’s say your photo posts outperformed text posts on Facebook. Next month, you can invest more time in imagery. And see if it improves your overall engagement rate.\n\nFurther reading: 18 Social Media KPIs (and How to Track Them)\n\nMonitor Your Social Media Performance\n\nwith Semrush Social\n\nStart Now →\nUse Social Media Management to Drive Results\n\nSemrush Social saves you time on social media management.
