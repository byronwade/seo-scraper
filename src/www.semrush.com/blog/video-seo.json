  "content": "Every creator wants their videos to be seen by as many people as possible.\n\nAnd video SEO is one way to achieve that.\n\nThis guide explains what it is and how to go about it.\n\nWhat Is Video SEO?\n\nVideo SEO is all about reaching a wider audience and getting more video views from search engines like Google.\n\nIt involves optimizing your video content so it ranks highly when people search for the topic your video covers.\n\nThis ensures viewers click your video instead of competitors’ videos.\n\nDone right, it leads to growth in views, subscribers, and website visitors (if you have a website).\n\nBut how do you get your videos to rank on Google? And what are the best practices to follow?\n\nLet’s find out.\n\n9 Video SEO Tips to Help Your Videos Rank\n\nRanking your videos on Google boils down to nine simple steps. Let’s go through them one by one.\n\nNote\n\nYou can optimize your videos so they rank well within YouTube as well—learn more about that in our YouTube SEO guide. But this article will focus on getting your videos to appear in traditional search engines. \n\n1. Make Videos About Topics People Are Searching For\n\nIf nobody is searching for the topic your video covers, then it won’t get many views from Google. Even if it ranks high.\n\nThat’s why it’s so important to focus on topics people are interested in.\n\nBut how do you find these topics?\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool can help.\n\nLet’s say you review and unbox tech products. Start by entering broad keywords like “unboxing” or “review” in the tool.\n\nIn this case, the tool will return all the popular search terms that contain the word “review.” Or some close variation.\n\nLooking at these keywords, they all seem unrelated to tech. \n\nSo we need to narrow things down.\n\nWhat do you review? Maybe smartphones, laptops, or game consoles?\n\nWhen people search for reviews, they usually search for videos of a specific product from a particular brand.\n\nFor example, “iphone 15 pro review.”\n\nSo, let’s focus our results by applying a filter to show product- or brand-specific keywords.\n\nYou can do this by clicking the “Include keywords” drop-down, selecting the circle next to “Any keywords,” and adding relevant brand or product names.\n\nAnd you’ll see a large pool of topic ideas for your videos.\n\nBut these topics aren’t fully qualified yet.\n\nFor a topic to make sense for a video, it must have clear \"video intent\"—i.e., people want to watch a video around your topic.\n\nIf the topic doesn’t have video intent, that means your video won’t rank in search results. No matter how hard you try.\n\nNormally, Google will just show traditional plain “blue link” results.\n\nBut if your topic has a video intent, it’ll show a special “Videos” section in search results. Like this:\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool can help you further narrow your list to only show topics where videos appear in search results. \n\nJust toggle these options under “SERP features” in the “Advanced filters” drop-down:\n\nYou’ll now be left with topics you should definitely cover.\n\nFind Topic Ideas for Videos\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Make High-Quality Videos\n\nGoogle ranks content that’s high quality.\n\nWhat does “high quality” mean?\n\nThere’s no definitive answer to this. And the exact recipe for creating a high-quality video varies from niche to niche.\n\nFor example, a tech reviewer should focus on in-depth analyses. While a fitness influencer should focus on showcasing proper form and technique.\n\nBut there are some common characteristics high-quality videos tend to have.\n\nFirst, their intros capture attention right away—in the first 15-20 seconds. So viewers are more likely to stay for the full video.\n\nSecond, high-quality videos provide value. By educating, entertaining, inspiring, and/or helping people in some way.\n\nAnd third, they meet certain production quality standards. Things like good camerawork, audio, lighting, editing, and overall technical execution matter a lot.\n\nThey make videos more immersive and enjoyable to watch.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about creating high-quality videos your audience wants to watch, check out our YouTube video on creating engaging videos.\n\n3. Optimize Your Videos’ Titles\n\nYour video’s title (which you add when uploading to YouTube or another hosting platform) appears alongside your video in the search results.\n\nLike this:\n\nOr specifically in the “Videos” section:\n\nGoogle looks at the title of your video to understand what topic your video covers. So, include your main keyword naturally in the title. \n\nNow, if someone searches for that keyword (and it has video intent), Google is more likely to show your video in the search results.\n\nAlso, keep your title under 60 characters. Because Google truncates titles that are too long.\n\nTitles also present the opportunity to improve the click-through rate (CTR) for your videos. And more clicks translate to more views.\n\nHow do you write titles that attract more clicks?\n\nAsk a question or include numbers if relevant. Like \"10 Tips for...\" or \"5 Must-Have Tools...\"\n\nMore people are likely to click on titles like these.\n\n4. Optimize Your Video Descriptions\n\nThe description you add when you upload your video can influence whether people click on it if it appears in search results.\n\nHow can you optimize your video description for CTR?\n\nHook people in the first sentence or so with a bold statement related to the video topic. Or highlight key benefits (if you’re covering a product).\n\nYou should also feature your main keyword in the video description. Because Google looks at the video description to understand your video’s topic and determine whether it should appear in search results.\n\nOne additional element to consider is the length of the description.\n\nYes, descriptions beyond 120 characters often get truncated in search results. \n\nBut if your video is hosted on YouTube or another hosting platform, it’s often best to provide a description that’s as detailed as possible.\n\nIn fact, longer descriptions are often better.\n\nThey give Google a deeper understanding of the content. Which can help your video show up for even more relevant phrases.\n\n5. Create Eye-Catching Thumbnails\n\nA video thumbnail is an image that shows what your content is about and draws the user’s interest.\n\nConsider this scenario:\n\nA user types in a query, and the search results populate along with a list of videos—including yours.\n\nIt would be difficult to stand out if you have a lousy thumbnail. And a user probably wouldn’t bother clicking.\n\nOn the other hand, having an eye-catching thumbnail is more likely to grab their attention. Increasing the chances they’ll click to watch your video.\n\nHow do you create eye-catching thumbnails?\n\nA lot of it depends on your niche.\n\nFor example, if you are a travel vlogger, using an image of yourself in a scenic destination related to your video's topic could be effective.\n\nOr, if you’re a tech reviewer, close-up shots of the product taken from an interesting angle could be enticing.\n\nThat’s what Marques Brownlee, a popular tech creator, often does with his videos:\n\nYou can also look at thumbnails from top creators in your space to see what works well. Take inspiration from those but give your thumbnails their own spin.\n\n6. Add Time Stamps to Your Videos\n\nGoogle sometimes shows time stamps as “key moments” under videos displayed in search results.\n\nThese key moments break your video into digestible sections. Which improves the user experience. Because viewers can easily skip to the parts they find the most relevant.\n\nHere are some best practices to follow when creating time stamps:\n\nWrite the timecode in MM:SS format (minutes:seconds)\nPut the label (a short descriptor) on the same line, separated by a colon or hyphen\nKeep your labels brief—otherwise, Google will truncate them\nMaintain chronological order matching the video flow\n\nCheck out the time stamps below from a video about Google Pixel 8 Pro for inspiration.\n\n7. Embed Your Videos in Relevant Webpages\n\nAdd your videos to relevant webpages on your site.\n\nThat’s what tech news site The Verge often does. \n\nFor example, when they published their review of the new iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, they embedded their full YouTube video covering the review in the post itself.\n\nThis enables them to have their video content rank in a few ways:\n\nThe original YouTube video can appear in Google search results\nThe webpage with the embedded video can also rank in regular Google search results.\n\nWhen someone clicks on the video-embedded page, they get sent to The Verge’s site—not YouTube.\n\nAnd that way, users will be able to engage with the video content and their website.\n\n8. Add Schema Markup to Pages with Embedded Videos\n\nIf you’re planning to embed videos in your webpages, consider using schema markup. Which is basically a code that gives Google additional context about your content.\n\nSpecifically, you can implement the VideoObject schema.\n\nThe sample code for that looks like this:\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n\"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\",\n\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n\"name\": \"Name of the video\",\n\"description\": \"This is the description of the video\",\n\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://example.com/thumbnail.png\",\n\"uploadDate\": \"2024-01-13\",\n\"duration\": \"PT1M54S\",\n}\n</script>\n\nWhat does this do? \n\nIt hands Google everything it needs to showcase your video in search results. And not just as a plain blue link result.\n\nWe're talking about rich results. Meaning your video's title, description, thumbnail, length, and other upload details can all be displayed right in the search results.\n\nLike this:\n\nYou might think adding a schema code requires highly technical skills. But you can do this yourself pretty easily.\n\nCheck out our dedicated resource on video schema that walks you through the entire process step by step.\n\n9. Build Links to Pages with Videos\n\nRanking well in Google results can be tough without backlinks.\n\nThese are links that point from other websites to your own.\n\nGoogle may look at these links as votes in your favor—indicators that other sites find your content authoritative, credible, and worth linking to.\n\nAnd more votes generally mean a higher chance of ranking well.\n\nThere are lots of link building strategies out there. Most of these revolve around outreach.\n\nThis is when you reach out to other sites in your industry and ask them to link to your video-embedded pages.\n\nBut first, you need to find those sites. \n\nSemrush’s Link Building Tool can help.\n\nFollow the setup process to get started.\n\nAnd you’ll see a list of websites that you can potentially reach out to:\n\nBefore you contact them, come up with a solid reason why they should link to you.\n\nIs it because your video provides a fresh perspective on a topic they're passionate about? Or maybe it offers exclusive information not published elsewhere?\n\nYour pitch should clearly highlight the value your content has.\n\nOnce you’re ready with your pitch, you can send it within the tool itself.\n\nBuild Backlinks\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nStart Your Video SEO Journey\n\nThat’s what you need to know about video SEO.\n\nNow put all that knowledge into practice:\n\nFind the best video topics using Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool\nOptimize them using the best practices shared in this post\nBuild links to your pages with videos\n\nBefore long, you should see your video content start ranking higher in Google search results.",
