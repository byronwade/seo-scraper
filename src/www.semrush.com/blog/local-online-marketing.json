  "content": "Local online marketing is how you promote your business to an audience in a specific geographic area using online digital tactics. \n\nAnd it can be extremely effective.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll discuss the different local digital marketing tactics you can use. And the importance of measuring your results.\n\n9 Local Online Marketing Tips to Grow Your Business\n\nLocal online marketing can help you gain visibility in search results, increase sales, and compete with larger companies.\n\nHere are some techniques you can include in your local online marketing strategy.\n\n1. Optimize Your Website for Local SEO\n\nSEO stands for search engine optimization. It involves making improvements to your website (and some off-page activities) to increase your visibility in search results. \n\nAnd local SEO is the process of optimizing your online presence to increase visibility on a local level.\n\nA key part of that is using the right keywords (terms people enter into search engines). So, you need content that uses keywords locals are searching for. \n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool can help you find local keywords that are a good fit for your business.\n\nTo get started, open the tool and enter a seed keyword (a broad search term related to your business) along with the geographic area you’re targeting. \n\n(We’re using “ac repair tampa” as an example for a company that provides air conditioning services in Tampa, Florida.)\n\nAnd then click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll now see a list of potential keywords. \n\nIncluding the location in the keyword helps to refine the results. But you can narrow your results even more by using the suggested groups and subgroups in the column to the left.\n\nOr try filtering by keyword difficulty. This is a metric out of 100 that indicates how difficult it would be to rank in the top 10 results for a given keyword.\n\nGo to the “KD %” drop-down menu and set a custom range from 0 to 29 to show only keywords that are categorized as “Easy” or “Very Easy.”\n\nYou probably don’t want to only focus on keywords with low difficulty scores. But this is a good starting point for local businesses that don’t have much online visibility.\n\nYou can also get ideas for keywords that people are searching in your area using Google’s autocomplete function. Because the suggestions are partially based on your location.\n\nStart entering a seed keyword and then see what suggestions Google offers. \n\nYou can then use Keyword Overview to look into the specifics for those keywords. And even find data specific to the location you’re interested in.\n\nIn the tool, enter the term you discovered using Google autocomplete (which might not contain a location name). Then set your location and click “Search.”\n\nNow, you can see location-specific information about the keyword. And determine whether you want to include it in your content plans. \n\nAnd here are some types of pages that are great for using keywords you want to include in your local SEO plans:\n\nAbout us: A page about your business, who you are, and how you got started. Locals like to get to know more about the companies they intend to do business with.\nFAQs: A page with FAQs about your products or services. Your local audience will often have questions they need answered before they’ll do business with you. Example: “Do You Charge Extra for Service Calls After Hours?”\nService pages: A page about a specific service you offer. These can rank for keywords related to services you offer and where you offer these services. Example: “AC Repair in Tampa, FL.”\nLocation pages: A page about your business’s physical locations. These can rank for your main business category and where your locations are. Example: “HVAC Contractors in Tampa, FL”.\nService area pages: A page about an area that you service but don’t have a physical location in. These can rank for your main business category and where you service customers. Example: “HVAC Contractors Serving Tampa, FL”.\nBlog articles: Educational pieces of content that can rank for keywords related to your business. These can help locals discover your business when they’re looking for a solution to their problem. Example: “How Often Should I Service My AC in Florida?”\n\nYour site’s user experience is also important.\n\nSo, focus on the mobile aspect and consider both layout and speed. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause many people make local searches on mobile devices when they’re out and about.\n\nYou can verify whether your site is mobile-friendly using Google Search Console.\n\nGo to “Experience” > “Mobile Usability” to identify any pages that aren’t mobile-friendly. And identify the specific issues you should address.\n\nFurther reading: Learn more about technical SEO and how it can impact your website.\n\n2. Create a Google Business Profile and Bing Places for Business Listing\n\nGoogle and Bing listings give you the opportunity to show more prominently in search results—which is huge when you consider how frequently people use search to find local options. And also help you generate online reviews.\n\nGoogle Business Profiles (GBPs) show up in Google searches in a knowledge panel (an information box about a local business).\n\nThey can also appear in Google Maps and the local pack (the top GBP listings for a given keyword).\n\nBing Places for Business listings show in Bing search results and Bing Maps.\n\nThese listings will show your business:\n\nName\nAddress\nPhone number\nWebsite link\nHours\nPrimary category\nDescription\n\nBest practices are to fill out each available field in your listings. This includes high-quality, helpful photos. We also recommend keeping your listings up to date.\n\nFor Google Business Profiles, go to Google Maps, open the left-hand menu, and click “Add your business.”\n\nThen, enter your business name.\n\nIf you see your business show up here, a listing already exists. You just need to claim it. You can start this process by clicking on your business and then following the prompts to verify your business.\n\nIf your business doesn’t show up, create the profile by clicking “Create a business with this name” and then following the prompts to create your business listing.\n\nFor Bing, create an account or log into Bing Places for Business.\n\nClick on “Claim or add your business manually” to start from the beginning. Or click on “Import from Google Business Profile now” if you’ve already set up and claimed your GBP.\n\nIf you don’t have a GBP listing yet, enter your business information and click “Search.”\n\nIf your business already exists, click on “Claim Business” and then follow the prompts to verify your business.\n\nIf your business does not show up, click on “My business is not listed in the search results” and then follow the prompts to create your business listing.\n\n3. Get Listed in Local Directories\n\nIt’s important that all of your business listings have consistent information to make sure everything customers are seeing is accurate and up to date. This includes your business name, address, and phone number (NAP).\n\nOne way you can do this is by creating business listings (also called citations) in other local directories such as:\n\nYelp\nBBB\nApple Maps\nCitysearch\nMerchantCircle\nSuperpages\nThe Real Yellow Pages\n\nYou’ll want to scan your listings across these directories to see whether they’re consistent. Then, you’ll know what needs to be added or corrected.\n\nThis can be done easily with Listing Management—which also works for Google Business Profile and Bing Places for Business.\n\nLook up your business by entering your business name, phone number, or website into the tool. \n\nYou’ll be brought to a screen showing you a summary of how your listings look across directories. That includes this information:\n\nOnline presence: A grade of how healthy your citations are overall\nListings to fix: How many listings need to be fixed\nAverage star rating: Your average review rating\nTotal reviews: Your total number of reviews\n\nIt will also show you a snippet of which citations are missing or have incorrect data.\n\nYou can export this list and use it to start addressing issues manually.\n\nOr click “Try it now” to test out the tool’s enhanced features for automatically updating your listings.\n\nIncrease Your Visibility\n\nwith the Listing Management Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Create Social Media Business Pages\n\nSocial media profiles are important because they’re a source of traffic. And they allow you to engage directly with your audience.\n\nThe first step in creating social media profiles is to determine which social media channels your target audience uses.\n\nOne2Target can help you do this.\n\nTo get started, open the tool, choose your location, and enter up to five competitors’ domains. Then, click “Analyze.”\n\nClick on the “Behavior” tab to see which social media channels your top competitors’ audiences are using.\n\nLet’s say you see that Instagram is one of the top social media channels your competitors’ audiences are using. It would be a good idea to create a social media profile there also.\n\nStart by creating your business account. \n\nNote that Instagram requires you to create a personal profile first. But it takes just a few minutes.\n\nYou can then easily complete your business account. And include information about your hours, location, and more.\n\nShow your location and contact information. So people nearby will be able to see that you’re close and easy to reach.\n\nSome social media platforms allow you to hide your business information as well. This can be helpful if you have a service-area business or if you have a very small client base and want to keep that information on a need-to-know basis.\n\n5. Monitor and Respond to Online Reviews\n\nMonitoring and responding to online reviews can help improve your online reputation. And alert you of issues that need your attention.\n\nWhen people leave reviews it’s very important to reply to them for two reasons:\n\nIt makes the customer who left the review feel appreciated and noticed\nIt can build trust with other potential customers who may be reading your public replies\n\nIt’s easy to monitor your online reviews with Review Management. You can see what people are saying about your business across different online directories.\n\nEnter your company name and click on the search icon.\n\nNow, scroll down to where it says “Manage reputation & track competitors.”\n\nYou’ll be able to see your average rating. As well as your total number of reviews.\n\nClick “Manage reviews now” to subscribe to use all the features. Including the ability to respond to Google reviews directly within the tool.\n\nThe goal is to reply to as many reviews as possible (positive, neutral, and negative) and to keep an eye out for important customer feedback.\n\nAnd remember that negative reviews can be valuable for identifying ways to improve.\n\n6. Set Up Geo-Targeted Search Ads\n\nTargeting search ads (ads that show up on search engines) by location puts you in front of nearby people actively searching for topics related to your business.\n\nYou can target your audience by a specific location directly within Google Ads. \n\nWhen you get to “Campaign settings,” scroll down to “Locations” and enter a relevant location (city, state, ZIP code, etc.). And select “Target.”\n\nYou can also set a specific radius (in miles or kilometers) around a location if you choose the “Advanced search” option. \n\n7. Run Ads on Social Media\n\nSocial media ads can also be targeted by location. Which puts you in front of nearby people who are active on social media.\n\nFor example, you can target Facebook Ads by location.\n\nStart by opening Meta Ads Manager and setting up your campaign. \n\nWhen you get to the “Audience” section, scroll down to “Locations.”\n\nHere, you can specify countries, states, cities, ZIP codes, and more. \n\n8. Create Content Focused on Your Local Audiences\n\nCreating content specifically intended for your local audience helps you appeal to their specific needs. And can boost your local SEO efforts.\n\nYou can identify which of your topics are already most popular with your local audience in Google Analytics 4 (GA4).\n\nLog into Google Analytics and go to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Engagement” > “Pages and screens.”\n\nClick on “Add filter.” Under “Dimensions” in the right-hand menu that appears, select a relevant option under “Geography.” \n\nFor “Match Type,” choose “exactly matches.” And then check the boxes for the location you want to include in the “Value” drop-down menu.\n\nNow, you can see which pages are most popular for this specific location. To help you understand which types of pieces you might want to create more of.\n\nYou can also generate new content ideas that are likely to appeal to locals using Semrush’s Topic Research tool.\n\nTo do this, open the tool, enter your topic, select your country, and click “Get content ideas”.\n\nNext, you’ll be shown content ideas. On this screen, you can drill down to the region or city level by clicking the drop-down menu that lists your country. And choosing a relevant region or city.\n\nIn this example, we’re using Tampa, Florida.\n\nYou can browse these results to see which topics might be a good fit for your local audience.\n\nFind Out What Ranks\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nFurther reading: Looking for more ideas?

Because it puts you in direct contact with locals who’ve agreed to be on your mailing list.\n\nYou can collect email addresses in many ways. Like by allowing users to subscribe to your newsletter, offering special content to those who submit their information (this is called gated content), and asking for email addresses when someone makes a purchase.\n\nOnce you’ve collected email addresses and other useful information about customers and prospects, you can segment your email lists by geography to target specific locations. It’s simple to do with just about any email marketing software.\n\nThis tactic can be very powerful for brick-and-mortar businesses running promotions. Because it can entice people to come in and become customers.\n\nNote ​​​​\n\nMake sure the users on your email list have opted in somehow. Meaning they’ve given you permission to email them.\n\nThe Importance of Using Analytics Tools to Track Performance\n\nTracking the performance of your marketing activities allows you to see what is and isn’t working. \n\nYou can also look for optimization opportunities, troubleshoot drops in traffic or conversions, and calculate your return on investment (ROI).\n\nThe first step is to identify your key performance indicators (KPIs). Which are valuable metrics you should track to see how you’re performing based on your goals.\n\nThen, you can monitor your performance tools like these:\n\nGoogle Analytics: Allows you to evaluate the overall performance of your website and content. Common metrics include views, users, conversions, and average engagement time per session.\nGoogle Search Console: Gives you an overview of your website’s SEO performance. Some of the most useful metrics are clicks, click-through rate, and impressions. \nGoogle Ads: Provides an overview of your performance across Google Ads campaigns. Some of the most common metrics marketers measure are click-through rate (CTR), cost per click (CPC), and return on ad spend (ROAS).\nMeta Ads Manager: Lets you review performance for campaigns across Facebook and Instagram. Some of the most commonly measured metrics are CTR, CPC, and ROAS.\nListing Management: Enables you to evaluate whether your listings are correct and consistent. And simplifies responding to reviews. Some metrics you might want to keep an eye on are listings to fix, total number of reviews, and average review rating.\n\nYou can even keep tabs on your local SEO performance using Position Tracking.\n\nFollow the Position Tracking configuration guide to start your project. And make sure to specify your specific location during setup. \n\nThen, click “Start Tracking.”\n\nThen, go to the “Overview” report to look into your specific rankings. And how they’re changing on a local level. \n\nFurther reading: If you’d like to see more metrics that might be helpful to track, read our guide on marketing KPIs.\n\nStart Reaching Local Audiences\n\nThere are many local online marketing tactics to choose from. But you don’t have to use all of them. Especially if you’re just getting started.\n\nFor instance, maybe you want to start by getting local listings and managing your reviews.\n\nListing Management can help with both.
