  "content": "If you sell products or services online, knowing the facts about ecommerce is key.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it can help you understand what the competition is up to, reveal untapped opportunities, and more.\n\nWith that in mind, here are the top 31 ecommerce statistics.\n\nGeneral Ecommerce Industry Statistics\nThere are more than 27 million ecommerce websites on the internet. Shopify is the most popular and is used by more than 5 million websites. (BuiltWith, 2024)\n\nImage Data Source: BuiltWith\n\nGlobal ecommerce sales reached an estimated $5.8 trillion in 2023. And Alibaba is the largest ecommerce retailer in the world, with a 23% market share. (Statista, 2023)\nAmazon is set to surpass Alibaba in global sales by 2027 (Statista, 2023)\nAmazon is expected to reach nearly 41% of total ecommerce sales in the U.S. in 2025 (eMarketer, 2024)\nThe average number of products per ecommerce order is 4.41 (Statista, 2024)\nThe average ecommerce conversion rate is 3.52% (Dynamic Yield, 2024)\nThe average ecommerce cart abandonment rate is 70.19% (Baymard Institute, 2023)\nThe top reason for cart abandonment is that the additional costs (e.g., shipping fees) are too high (Statista, 2024) \nMore than 90% of U.S. shoppers typically look for deals and discounts before making an online purchase (Statista, 2020)\nMillennials and Gen Z shoppers are more likely to wait for discounts before purchasing something online. Gen X shoppers are the least likely to wait for discounts. (Statista, 2023)\nFree shipping is the most important ecommerce delivery criterion for U.S. shoppers (Statista, 2024)\nEcommerce businesses lost $48 billion to fraud in 2023 (Juniper Research, 2024)\nWhat These Stats Reveal\n\nGiven the huge footprint Amazon and Alibaba have in the ecommerce space, it’s a good idea to use those types of platforms if it makes sense for your brand. \n\nIt’s also clear that online shoppers have a lot of barriers to buying. So, it’s wise to do anything you can to streamline their experiences.\n\nOne way to do that is to ensure your pages load quickly. Which deters visitors from leaving before making a purchase.\n\nUse the Site Audit tool to identify slow pages. And then take steps to improve them.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nMobile Ecommerce Statistics\nSmartphone devices accounted for 77% of online retail store visits in Q1 of 2024 (Statista, 2024)\nTwo-thirds of online purchases are made with smartphone devices (Statista, 2024)\nWorldwide mobile ecommerce sales reached $2.2 trillion in 2023. And they’re expected to surpass $3.4 trillion by 2027. (Statista, 2023)\nMobile ecommerce sales account for 60% of all ecommerce sales globally (Statista, 2023)\nMore than three-quarters of U.S. adults make online purchases using a smartphone (Pew Research, 2022)\n\nImage Data Source: Pew Research\n\nAlmost half of U.S. adults aged 30 to 49 make online purchases using their smartphone every week (Pew Research, 2022)\nWhat These Stats Reveal\n\nIt should come as no surprise that mobile devices account for a large percentage of online ecommerce visits and purchases.\n\nAnd because smartphone use in online shopping is expected to grow, it’s a good idea to work on making your website as mobile-friendly as possible.\n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to identify issues that affect your website’s mobile performance.\n\nSocial Commerce Statistics\nThree out of every 10 U.S. social media users have purchased a product after seeing an influencer post about it (Pew Research, 2022)\nU.S. adults aged 18 to 29 are most likely to make purchases based on influencer recommendations, with 41% having done so (Pew Research, 2022)\n\nImage Source: Pew Research\n\nAlmost half (49.5%) of social media users in the U.S. have made at least one purchase via a social channel in 2023 (eMarketer, 2023)\nU.S. social sales are expected to grow to over $144 billion by 2027 (eMarketer, 2023)\nWorldwide social commerce sales amounted to $571 billion in 2023 (Statista, 2024)\nForecasts show that annual social commerce sales per buyer will rise to over $1,200 by 2027 (eMarketer, 2023)\nAdult social media users in the U.S. are most likely to make purchases through Facebook (eMarketer, 2024)\nFacebook is expected to have over 69 million social buyers in 2025. Instagram follows right behind it, with 47 million expected social buyers by 2025 (Statista, 2023) \nAlmost 70% of Gen Z shoppers are likely to make purchases directly on TikTok (Jungle Scout, 2023)\nWhat These Stats Reveal\n\nSocial media platforms and influencers have a big impact on online shoppers’ behavior. So, it’s crucial to have a social media marketing strategy and a strong brand presence across relevant social networks.\n\nYou can use the “Behavior” report in Semrush’s One2Target tool to learn which platforms your audience spends the most time on.\n\nAnd then work on growing your brand’s presence across those platforms.\n\nStreamline Audience Research\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\nOnline Payment Statistics\nDigital wallet payments account for about half of all ecommerce payments around the world (Statista, 2023)\nThe estimated transaction value for ecommerce digital wallet payments in 2023 was $3.1 billion (Statista, 2023)\nDigital wallets are expected to make up 61% of ecommerce transaction value—for a total of $5.4 billion—by 2027 (Statista, 2023)\nPayPal is the most popular ecommerce payment brand among U.S. shoppers (Statista, 2024)\n\nImage Source: Statista\n\nWhat These Stats Reveal\n\nDigital wallets are steadily overtaking credit and debit cards as ecommerce payment options.\n\nIf you haven’t done so already, you should work on implementing multiple digital wallet payment options to give customers more ways to pay. And possibly optimize conversion rates among shoppers who aren’t comfortable sharing their credit or debit card information online.\n\nGrow Your Ecommerce Business\n\nKeeping up with online shopping trends is crucial for ensuring that your ecommerce business stays profitable.\n\nWe recommend that you focus on growing your brand’s presence on social media and implementing more payment options to cater to consumers’ changing preferences. \n\nAlso, work on improving your website’s performance and mobile-friendliness with the help of Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nGet started with Semrush today.\n\nElevate Your Digital Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
