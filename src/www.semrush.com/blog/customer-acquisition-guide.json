  "content": "Your customers are your company’s most valuable assets. \n\nSo, you need to have a solid customer acquisition strategy that consistently brings new customers to your business. Helping you generate more revenue and sustainable growth. \n\nIn this guide, we’ll show you how to build a powerful customer acquisition strategy that attracts new leads and turns them into loyal customers. \n\nBut first, let’s start with the basics.\n\nWhat Is Customer Acquisition?\n\nCustomer acquisition is the process of bringing new customers to your business. Through channels like social media, search engines (like Google), and email marketing.\n\nCustomer acquisition involves identifying, reaching, engaging, and nurturing potential customers through these channels. And ultimately converting them into paying customers.\n\nThe primary goal of customer acquisition is to engage your potential customers in ways that build trust, interest in what you have to offer, and a willingness to make a purchase.\n\nIn this way, customer acquisition goes hand-in-hand with customer retention.\n\nCustomer Acquisition vs. Customer Retention\n\nCustomer acquisition focuses on acquiring new customers.\n\nCustomer retention is the process of turning your existing customers into repeat buyers.\n\nBoth are closely linked and essential for long-term success and business growth. But you can’t retain customers without acquiring them in the first place.\n\nFurther reading: 65 Customer Retention Statistics You Need to Know in 2024\n\nWhy Is Customer Acquisition Important?\n\nCustomer acquisition helps you expand your customer base. And it counterbalances the natural attrition of your existing customer base. \n\nBecause no matter how good a company’s customer retention strategy is, they’re likely to lose some existing customers over time. \n\nHaving a powerful customer acquisition strategy lets you offset these inevitable losses. Helping your business not only maintain a balance but also a steady pace of growth.\n\nCustomer acquisition is also important for:\n\nMarket expansion: Acquiring new customers from untouched segments can help you diversify your customer base. And reduce your dependence on a single market.\nIncreased brand awareness: As your customer base grows, so does the chance of other people hearing about your brand through word of mouth. Helping you increase brand awareness and build a solid reputation in the market.\nGather feedback: New customers bring new feedback and demands. Which can help you drive improvements in your products or services.\nThe 3 Main Customer Acquisition Stages\n\nAt any given time, your customers are at different stages of the buyer’s journey. This journey can be summarized into a funnel of three customer acquisition stages:\n\n1. Awareness\n\nIn the awareness stage, potential customers understand that they have a specific need or problem. And they may (or may not) be actively looking for a solution. They also likely don’t have a product or service in mind yet.\n\nThis is your opportunity to grab their attention and introduce them to your brand. By addressing and providing a solution to their problem. \n\nImagine you sell an online fitness course. Your potential customers include people who feel less energetic and struggle to stay motivated throughout the day. \n\nThey search for queries like “how to get fit” or “how to increase energy levels” on Google.\n\nHere, they realize they have a problem and need a solution. But they aren’t necessarily looking to make a purchase yet.\n\n2. Consideration\n\nIn this stage, potential customers explore different solutions to solve their problem. This is your opportunity to show how your solution stands out from the alternatives.\n\nYour potential customers have realized that subscribing to an online fitness course can help them.\n\nThey now search for queries like “best online fitness courses” on Google. To compare the different options and find the best fit for them.\n\n3. Conversion \n\nConversion is the final stage where potential customers make the decision to purchase your product or service. \n\nYour potential customers have compared different online fitness courses. And are now leaning toward your course.\n\nThis is where having an effective conversion rate optimization strategy comes into play.\n\nNote\n\nThere are other ways to define the different stages of customer acquisition, often called the marketing funnel. \n\nTop Customer Acquisition Channels\n\nHere are the best customer acquisition channels to consider, no matter what type of business you run:\n\n1. Organic Search \n\nOrganic search refers to unpaid listings that appear in search engine results pages (SERPs). \n\nHere’s an example of a website ranking organically for the keyword “best project management software”:\n\nWhy leverage organic search as a customer acquisition channel?\n\nBecause Google processes 6.3 million searches each minute. Bing has more than 100 million daily active users across the globe.\n\nSearch engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo are the go-to places for many people to find answers to their queries. And—importantly—to discover products and services.\n\nStandard organic search listings represent great opportunities for customer acquisition. For example, a potential customer at the beginning of the buyer’s journey might search for a term like “what is padel tennis” and see results like below:\n\nThe top result is from Head, a sports company that sells padel racquets. They include links to their products in this article. Showcasing organic search as a viable customer acquisition channel.\n\nBut organic search is also a powerful acquisition channel for small and local businesses.\n\nImagine you own a plumbing business. And you target potential customers in your local area.\n\nYour target audience might search for the keyword “plumbing services london” and see your website ranking in the local pack. \n\nAppearing in the local pack can:\n\nIncrease your business’s visibility\nProvide users with key information about your business (like where it is on the map)\nBuild credibility\n2. Paid Search\n\nPaid search refers to paid search results. These results are typically labeled as “Sponsored” or “Ad.” \n\nHere’s an example of a paid search ad ranking for the query “web hosting provider”:\n\nTo leverage paid search as a customer acquisition channel, you need to run a paid ads campaign. \n\nOn search engines, paid ads typically run on a pay-per-click (PPC) basis. PPC is a business model where an advertiser pays a fee each time someone clicks on their ad. \n\nWhen you launch a PPC campaign, your ads can appear in front of your target audience almost instantly. And the moment you stop funding your PPC campaign or your ad budget runs out, the visibility and traffic from these campaigns come to an immediate stop. \n\nAside from traditional search ads that appear like those in the image above, you’ll also find paid ads in Google’s Shopping tab.\n\nPeople browsing this tab for search terms are likely in the consideration or perhaps even conversion stage of the customer acquisition funnel. Making paid ads in this area a useful channel for businesses that sell products.\n\nYou can also find paid ads in areas like the local finder, which appears when you expand the local pack.\n\nAs with appearing in the local pack organically, this is a useful place to get your local business in front of searchers that are likely ready to spend money. \n\n3. Organic Social \n\nOrganic social refers to unpaid social media content. \n\nAs with organic search, you don’t have to pay money to put your content in front of your target audience. Instead, your audience discovers it naturally.\n\nHere’s an example of social media post from Chewy organically appearing in Instagram’s reel section:\n\nPeople spend an average of more than two hours on social media each day. And social media platforms have billions of active users.\n\nBut which platform(s) should you choose?\n\nIdentify the ones where your target audience hangs out the most. And makes purchasing decisions on. \n\nFor example, if you sell customer relationship management (CRM) software, leveraging professional/business-focused channels like LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter) make sense. \n\nConversely, if you run a fashion brand, consider Instagram and TikTok. Because these platforms are visually oriented and often used to share fashion and lifestyle content.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse One2Target to quickly understand which social media platforms your target audience uses most. And use this information to pinpoint your customer acquisition strategy.\n \n\n4. Paid Social \n\nPaid social is social media content you display to your target audience through paid ads. \n\nSuch content is typically marked as “Ad,” “Promoted,” or “Sponsored.”\n\nHere’s an example of a paid ad on LinkedIn:\n\nHere are some benefits of paid social over organic:\n\nTargeted reach: You can pinpoint what kind of people you want to engage by setting specific criteria such as age, location, interests, and behaviors\nFast visibility: You can quickly boost visibility because paid ads can start showing up in your audience’s feeds as soon as you fund your campaigns\nTrack results: You can closely monitor the effectiveness of your campaigns by tracking metrics like engagement rate, click-through rate, and conversions\n\nAs with paid search ads, there are various places your paid social media content can appear. Including in users’ feeds, stories, and videos, like Instagram Reels. \n\n5. Email \n\nEmail is another powerful customer acquisition channel. Because billions of people use email to communicate with others. \n\nYou can leverage this channel to directly communicate with your potential and existing customers. \n\nHere’s an example from Airtable, where they communicate the launch of their new feature, Airtable AI, through email:\n\nUnlike many other customer acquisition channels, where algorithms can have a major impact on your visibility, you have (almost) full control over email. \n\nYou can leverage this channel for different purposes. Like educating potential customers about your products and promoting new offerings. \n\nFurther reading: What Is Email Marketing? The Definitive Guide for Beginners\n\n6. Podcast Streaming Platforms\n\nMore than 460 million people listen to podcasts. Making podcast streaming platforms (like Spotify and Apple Podcasts) great channels for customer acquisition.\n\nImagine you own a small coffee shop. \n\nBy hosting a podcast that focuses on discussions about coffee beans and brewing techniques, you can attract an audience interested in specialty coffee and café culture.\n\nBy sharing your expertise and passion for coffee, you can build trust and establish your brand as a thought leader in the coffee industry. \n\nYou can also appear as a guest on other popular coffee-related podcasts or invite experts to speak on your own podcast. \n\nWhen you invite industry experts to your show, it enriches your podcast with diverse knowledge and perspectives. Making it appealing to regular listeners.\n\nSimilarly, by appearing on other podcasts, you can tap into the host’s established following and authority to expand your reach. And further build trust and authority with potential customers. \n\n6 Winning Customer Acquisition Strategies\n\nHere are six customer acquisition strategies to suit the channels we discussed above:\n\n1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving a website’s search engine visibility through non-paid tactics. \n\nThese tactics involve publishing high-quality content and optimizing it for both users and search engines. Helping you improve visibility and attract more customers.\n\nThe higher your website ranks on search engines, the more likely it is to be seen by potential customers. \n\nA Backlinko study of around 4 million Google Search results revealed that:\n\nThe first organic search result attracts 27.6% of all clicks\nThe second position receives 15.8%.\nThe third organic search result garners 11% of the total clicks\n\nSEO involves a lot of different strategies and techniques, including:\n\nFinding the right keywords for your business\nMaking your website mobile-friendly\nAdding on-page SEO elements (like title tags and headers) to your webpages \nLinking internally to other important pages and posts\n\nAnd much more.\n\nSemrush offers a wide range of tools to guide your SEO efforts. \n\nLike the Keyword Magic Tool. It helps you identify relevant keywords for your business. Which you can target on your website to improve your rankings. \n\nTo get started, enter a seed keyword (a broad term related to your business). Select a target location and click “Search.”\n\nNext, you’ll see a list of related keywords. Along with key metrics like search intent, search volume, and keyword difficulty. \n\nTo find keywords that are most likely to lead to customer acquisition for your business, narrow your search down with filters.\n\nFor example, you can filter for terms with lower keyword difficulties. To do this, click the “KD %” filter and set a custom range of 0-49. Then click “Apply.”\n\nYou can also filter by intent. This lets you only show keywords that, for example, suggest the searcher is closer to the conversion stage of the customer acquisition funnel. \n\nTo do this, click the “Intent” filter and select “Commercial” and “Transactional.” Then click “Apply.”\n\nIn the list below, you may want to target terms like “dog toys for aggressive chewers.” It’s a specific keyword with high search volume and a relatively low keyword difficulty. Plus, it has transactional intent (denoted by the “T”), indicating the searcher is ready to buy.\n\nOnce you have a list of keywords to target, you can then create and optimize high-quality content for those terms. And hopefully drive potential customers to your website through organic search.\n\nFind Keywords to Acquire New Customers\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Paid Advertising\n\nYou can run paid advertising campaigns on search engines, like Google and Bing. And on social media platforms, like Facebook and LinkedIn.\n\nObviously paid ad campaigns cost money. So this is only a viable customer acquisition strategy for those with the budget. \n\nHowever, it can yield results much faster than a strategy like SEO. Making it an ideal choice for businesses that need to convert users quickly. Or for launching products or special promotions that are time-sensitive. \n\nUse Semrush’s advertising tools to guide your paid ads efforts. \n\nFor example, the Advertising Research tool helps you review your competitors’ ads with ease. To find out what’s working for them and gain insights to adapt your own strategies.\n\nEnter your competitor’s website URL and select your target location. Then click “Search.” \n\nThen click the “Ads Copies” tab. \n\nHere, you can see a list of ads your competitor has used, and the copy each ad contained. Clicking the “Keywords” drop-down under one of the ads will show you all the keywords the ad could show for. Along with search volume and the cost per click.\n\nYou can use these as inspiration to run a winning paid search campaign for your own business. \n\nAnalyze Your Competitors’ Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Social Media Marketing\n\nSocial media marketing refers to the use of social media platforms to naturally attract and engage your audience. It involves:\n\nBuilding a social media strategy\nPublishing high-quality content consistently on social media channels where your target audience is most active\nInteracting with your target audience, typically through comments\nAnalyzing and reporting on platform-specific metrics\n\nSocial media marketing can help you reach more customers. But it requires significant time investment.\n\nUse the Semrush Social toolkit to streamline the social media management process. For example, use the Social Poster to draft, schedule, and post content on multiple social media channels at once.\n\nUse Social Tracker to analyze your competitors’ social media presence. And compare their growth and engagement to yours.\n\nAnd use Social Analytics to measure your social media marketing efforts. To monitor your followers and engagement levels for Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn all in one place.\n\nFinally, use Social Inbox to receive and respond to social media messages across different platforms, all in one place.\n\nThese tools make managing your social media marketing strategy straightforward and less time consuming. So you can focus more on customer acquisition, rather than juggling lots of different platforms at one time.\n\nStreamline Your Social Media Management\n\nwith a Semrush Social Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\n4. Content Marketing\n\nContent marketing involves producing and sharing valuable online content (like blog posts, how-to guides, videos, podcast episodes, and emails) to attract and engage your target audience. \n\nYou can create content for different customer acquisition channels like organic search, organic social, email, and podcast streaming platforms. \n\nContent marketing can increase brand awareness, build trust, and establish authority. Helping you generate more leads and conversions.\n\nContent marketing is more than just producing and sharing content online. You need to produce content that’s valuable, engaging, and interesting. It should:\n\nAddress your audience’s needs and problems\nProvide them with a solution \nCatch their attention at first glance and keep them engaged\nEncourage your readers/viewers to take action\n\nUse the Topic Research tool to generate ideas for engaging content. Enter a broad topic related to your business. Let’s imagine you offer graphic design tuition services and you also offer courses as a digital product.\n\nSelect your target location and click “Get content ideas.”\n\nThe tool will display cards of related topics for you to create content around. Clicking “Show more” under one of the cards displays top headlines and questions for that topic. \n\nAlong with search volume, difficulty, and topic efficiency (where high topic efficiency means high volume but low difficulty).\n\nUse these topic ideas to create content. Or to optimize your existing content with relevant subheadings and questions your target audience is asking.\n\nFor example, you could create blog posts that answer questions surrounding where people can learn graphic design and how they can learn logo design. Then you can point to your course within those blog posts as a way to acquire customers.\n\nGet Content Ideas to Acquire New Customers\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n5. Video Marketing\n\nVideo marketing uses videos to market your product, service, or brand. \n\nIt involves planning, producing, editing, and sharing videos on different channels. Like YouTube, social media, and your website.\n\nHere’s an example from GoPro’s YouTube channel:\n\nThe video showcases user-generated content in a way that also shows off GoPro’s product. Making it a great blend of entertaining content and product promotion.\n\nYou can create different kinds of videos to suit different customer acquisition strategies:\n\nEducational: To educate your audience about a specific topic revolving around their pain points\nUser-generated: To showcase real-life customer experiences related to your product, service, or brand (like the GoPro example above)\nProduct walkthroughs: To demonstrate how your product works\nHow-to: To deliver practical advice or instructions on achieving specific tasks using your product\nCase study: To showcase results achieved by your customers after using your product or service\n\nYou can use videos to establish a strong organic presence (as videos often show up in Google search results). \n\nAnd you can use them in your paid ad campaigns. To increase the chances of catching your audience’s attention. And making them click-through to your landing pages.\n\nFurther reading: Video Marketing: The Ultimate Guide for 2024\n\n6. Email Marketing\n\nEmail marketing involves sending targeted emails to your email list. This is a list of email addresses of people who have signed up to receive emails from your business. \n\nYou can run email marketing campaigns to:\n\nKeep your subscribers engaged, by sharing valuable content like blog posts\nInform potential customers about upcoming product launches\nPromote special offers or discounts to encourage sales\nAnnounce events or webinars\n\nSegment your email list to deliver more personalized and relevant content to different groups of subscribers. Based on their interests, behaviors, and stages in the customer journey.\n\nDifferent types of emails you can create include:\n\nEducational Emails\n\nEducational emails help you address and provide a solution to the problems your target audience faces. Further helping you build trust and establish your brand as an authority in the field.\n\nThe Semrush Newsroom email newsletter is an example of this. It provides readers with the latest SEO news, along with helpful tips and resources. \n\nPromotional Emails\n\nPromotional emails can help you encourage purchases. By showcasing special offers, discounts, or new products to encourage purchases.\n\nThis email, by Old Navy, uses a sense of urgency to drive purchases. The countdown clock indicates that a 40% off everything sale is ending soon. Also, the use of \"online exclusive\" suggests that this offer isn’t available in physical stores.\n\nRe-Engagement Emails\n\nRe-engagement emails can help you reconnect with subscribers who haven't interacted with your brand in a while. \n\nThis email by Grammarly is a clever example of a re-engagement email. The playful concept of a “Wrinkle in Time Badge” adds a touch of humor and acknowledges the user's absence without being pushy.\n\nAlso, it encourages the recipient to come back and continue using the service by reminding them of the value Grammarly adds to their writing.\n\nHow to Build a Customer Acquisition Plan\n\nFollow these steps to create a winning customer acquisition plan for your business:\n\n1. Define Your Target Audience\n\nDefining your target audience gives you clarity on: \n\nThe challenges they face\nHow they make purchasing decisions\nWhat kind of content they like to consume\nWhich platforms they use\nTheir interests\n\nTo find out detailed information about your target audience and where they hang out, use Semrush’s One2Target tool.\n\nTo start, enter up to five competitor URLs (your competitor’s target audience is likely similar to yours). Then, click “Analyze.”\n\nThe tool will then provide information about your competitors’ target audience. Like their demographics, behaviors, and socioeconomics. You can find out which platforms your target audience uses by clicking the “Behavior” tab.\n\nThis shows you which social media platforms are most popular with each competitor’s audience. Use this information to understand which social media platforms might be the best customer acquisition channels for your own business.\n\nIdentify Your Target Audience\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\n2. Perform Competitive Analysis\n\nA competitive analysis is the process of researching your competitors to better understand their product, sales, and marketing strategies. \n\nYou can use this research to identify their strengths and weaknesses. And discover opportunities. \n\nPerforming competitive analysis lets you:\n\nBetter understand your target market, industry, and customers\nFind out who your direct competitors are\nUnderstand what customer acquisition channels your competitors are using\nIdentify gaps in your existing customer acquisition strategy\n\nSemrush’s Organic Research tool lets you gain insights into your competitor’s presence on search engines. Use this information to understand how you can leverage organic search as a customer acquisition channel.\n\nTo get started, enter a competitor’s domain, choose a target location, and click “Search.”\n\nNext, you’ll see a comprehensive overview of their domain's performance in organic search results. This includes key metrics like the number of keywords they rank for, their organic traffic, and their top keywords by traffic share. \n\nClicking “View all # keywords” shows you all the keywords that competitor ranks for.\n\nThis data can give you an insight into the kinds of terms your competitors are targeting. Helping you understand what kinds of keywords you might want to target with your own content marketing efforts.\n\nPro tip\n\nAs with the Keyword Magic Tool, you can use filters like keyword difficulty and search intent to narrow down the list of keywords most suitable for your business.\n \n\n3. Set Your Goals\n\nSetting appropriate goals will guide your customer acquisition efforts. \n\nThey should directly align with your business goals. To prove your customer acquisition efforts are directly contributing to your revenue metrics.\n\nSo, if your revenue goal is $500K in new business over the next year, you need to set customer acquisition goals that directly align with reaching this revenue target.\n\nUse the SMART framework to do this:\n\nHere’s an example of a SMART customer acquisition goal:\n\nAcquire 10,000 new website visitors by the end of Q3 through a combination of SEO and content marketing strategies.\n\nThis goal is:\n\n(S)pecific: Focused on increasing website visitors\n(M)easurable: Quantified as 10,000 visitors\n(A)chievable: It’s a fairly realistic number\n(R)elevant: More visitors can lead to more conversions\n(T)ime-bound: By the end of Q3 2024\n\nHere are some more examples of SMART customer acquisition goals you can adapt to your own plans:\n\nConvert 2% of website visitors into email subscribers within the next 6 months by optimizing the website's call to action placements and offering valuable lead magnets\nLaunch a targeted ad campaign on LinkedIn to generate 500 qualified leads in Q2, aiming for a 5% conversion rate into paying customers\n4. Decide the Best Customer Acquisition Channels for Your Business\n\nWe noted above that you can find the best social media platforms to target as customer acquisition channels using the One2Target tool. \n\nBut here are a few more ways to identify the best channels for your business:\n\nConduct customer surveys: Ask your existing customers (or leads) which channels they’re active on the most, or how they found your business\nTrack your website analytics: This helps you understand which sources already drive traffic to your website\nPerform A/B testing: Run marketing campaigns across different channels to see which platforms deliver the best return on investment (ROI)\nUse industry benchmarks: Research industry benchmarks to understand which ones typically offer the best return for businesses like yours\n\nYou also need to consider your budget and resources. If you have a limited budget, you might have to rule out strategies like paid social and instead focus on SEO or content marketing. \n\nAnd while targeting multiple channels can generate more leads and sales when done right, spreading your resources too thin can mitigate these potential gains. So you might see better results by focusing on a single channel at first.\n\n5. Measure Your Customer Acquisition Efforts\n\nMeasuring your customer acquisition efforts can give insights into what’s working and what’s not. Helping ensure you spend your marketing budget wisely.\n\nHere are some key metrics to track:\n\nCustomer Acquisition Cost (CAC)\n\nCAC is the total cost of acquiring a new customer. It includes marketing and sales expenses divided by the number of new customers acquired during a specific period. You calculate it with the following formula:\n\nCustomer Growth Rate\n\nThis is the increase in the number of new customers over a specific time frame. It reflects the business's ability to expand its customer base.\n\nCustomer Lifetime Value (CLV)\n\nCLV is the total revenue a business can reasonably expect from a single customer throughout the business relationship.\n\nChurn Rate\n\nChurn rate is the percentage of customers or subscribers who stop using a company's products or services within a specific time period. It's a critical metric for understanding customer retention and satisfaction.\n\nContinuously Refine Your Content Acquisition Strategy\n\nBuilding a customer acquisition strategy isn’t a one-off task. \n\nYou need to measure your efforts and continuously refine it. Based on what’s working for your business. And what’s not.\n\nTools like Semrush can help you at every step of the customer acquisition process.\n\nWhether it’s the Keyword Magic Tool to find terms to target with your blog content. Or One2Target for identifying the best social media platforms to run paid ads on to reach your target audience.\n\nGet access to 55+ helpful tools and reports with a Semrush free trial.\n\nBoost Your Customer Acquisition Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
