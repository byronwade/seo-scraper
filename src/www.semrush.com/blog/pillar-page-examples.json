  "content": "What Is a Pillar Page?\n\nA pillar page is a webpage that offers an extensive overview of a broad topic.\n\nIt’s called a “pillar” page because it provides foundational knowledge of the topic. Which other pages called “cluster pages” will expand upon while covering relevant subtopics.\n\nThe pillar page also links to the cluster pages—and vice versa—to help readers broaden their knowledge of the overall topic cluster.\n\nLike so:\n\nThis way, readers can learn more about the main topic as a whole. No matter whether they started by reading a pillar page or a cluster page.\n\nLet’s look at three types of pillar pages you can create, along with some of the best pillar page examples.\n\nTypes of Pillar Pages\n\nThere are three broad categories of pillar pages:\n\n“Guide” pillar pages aim to provide an overall guide to a topic. They may answer general questions like “What is [topic],” “How does [topic] work,” “How can you get started with [topic],” and “What are tips for doing [topic].”\n“What-is” pillar pages focus on defining a topic and providing its background context. For example, apart from answering the question “What is [topic],” a what-is pillar page may also explain how the topic’s underlying concepts were derived. Or, the history behind it.\n“How-to” pillar pages explain how to do something in relation to the topic. They often include step-by-step instructions. How-to pillar pages may also include diagrams and videos to facilitate the discussion.\n\nThere is some overlap between each pillar page type.\n\nFor example, guide pillar pages often include explanations of “what is” and “how to.” Which “what-is” and “how-to” pillar pages respectively also cover—though usually in more detail.\n\nSo, we recommend not getting hung up on forcing your content into any one pillar page type.\n\nInstead, focus your efforts on finding keywords worth creating pillar pages for—and building high-performing content pillars around.\n\nHow to Find Pillar Page Keywords\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool can help you find broad keywords for pillar pages.\n\nLaunch the tool and type a broad keyword related to your niche into it. Select the country from which you want to see results, then click “Search.”\n\nYou will get a list of potential pillar page keywords.\n\nIn this example, the Keyword Magic Tool suggests keywords like:\n\nMeditation: Could be the keyword for a guide pillar page on meditation\nMeditation music: Could be the keyword for a guide pillar page on meditation music\nHow to meditate: Could be the keyword for a how-to pillar page explaining how to meditate\n\nYou can also refine the keyword list using the filters at the top of the tool.\n\nFor example, select “Broad Match” to see keywords that are variations of your initial keyword.\n\nAnd click the “Questions” tab to get keywords in the form of questions. Like:\n\nHow to meditate: Could be the keyword for a how-to pillar page explaining how to meditate (as mentioned earlier)\nWhat is meditation: Could be the keyword for a what-is pillar page explaining what meditation is. And how the practice came about.\nWhat is transcendental meditation: Could be the keyword for a what-is pillar page explaining the concept of transcendental meditation\n\nGet Pillar Page Ideas\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nFinding Pillar Page Subtopics for Cluster Pages\n\nAfter creating your pillar page, build cluster pages on relevant subtopics.\n\nDoing so creates a topic cluster. Which helps your website become the one-stop, go-to resource for information on your niche.\n\nIn turn, getting you more eyeballs on and backlinks to your website. And potentially boosting your traffic and rankings.\n\nGet ideas for pillar page subtopics by researching keyword clusters in Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool.\n\nEnter your pillar page keyword into the tool and select “US” as the database from which you want to get results. Then click “Search.”\n\nNote\n\nOnly the United States database can provide keyword cluster data at this time.\n\nScroll down the “Overview” page and click “View all clusters” to get keyword clusters for your pillar page keyword.\n\nThe tool will display the keyword clusters in a new browser tab. Make a note of those that look like good pillar page subtopics.\n\nSemrush’s Topic Research tool can also help you generate a list of pillar page subtopics.\n\nLaunch the tool and type your pillar page keyword into the search bar. Select the country from which you want to see results, then click “Get content ideas.”\n\nYou’ll see various cards with related topic ideas for your pillar page keyword. Along with the search volume for their associated keywords.\n\nClick any card to learn:\n\nThe headlines of articles others have written about this related topic\nThe questions people have been asking about this topic\nRelated searches for the topic\n\nAll of these can provide inspiration for pillar page subtopics.\n\n9 Top Pillar Page Examples\n\nLet’s look at nine outstanding examples of pillar pages—three from each pillar page type—worth taking notes from as you create your own.\n\nExamples of Guide Pillar Pages\n1. “A First-Time Owner’s Guide to Caring for a New Puppy” by Petcube\n\nThis guide pillar page provides essential information that first-time owners should know about getting a puppy, like:\n\nHow to choose a puppy\nHow to puppy-proof their home\nTypes of puppy supplies they’ll need\nBasic puppy training commands\nCommon new puppy owner mistakes\n\nEach page section includes links to other articles with more detailed information on related topics:\n\nAnd at the bottom of the page are answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) on puppy ownership.\n\nThe page also includes photos of cute puppies!\n\nThese photos catch the reader’s eye. And entice them to continue reading.\n\nIn any case, readers will know the page will take them roughly 11 minutes to read. As seen from the page’s estimated read time:\n\nWhich in turn gives them an idea of the page’s comprehensiveness beforehand.\n\nMain takeaways:\n\nProvide answers to FAQs on your pillar page. These answers can also appear as the answers to the “People Also Ask” (PAA) questions on Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs)—and get great visibility there. Seventy-five percent of PAA results are found within the top three results on the SERPs, according to our 2020 PAA SEO study.\nInclude images to make your page more visually interesting. And hold readers’ attention for longer. (But since images generally have larger file sizes, compress them. So they don’t take too long to load.)\nDisplay your pillar page’s estimated read time to let readers know how long they may need to read it in full. And help them decide whether your page provides the level of detail they’re looking for.\n2. “Guide to Pottery Techniques: Everything You Need to Know” by Gathered\n\nGathered collaborated with expert potter Katrina Pechal to produce this guide pillar page on pottery-making.\n\nA table of contents at the top of the page tells readers what they can learn from it:\n\nAnd each table of contents heading is a jump link that leads visitors to its respective content section when clicked.\n\nSprinkled throughout the page are images and video embeds that help illustrate various pottery techniques:\n\nThe page also recommends places where budding potters can access materials and kilns.

Which talk about their rock-climbing experience.\n\nWhile at the top, you’ll see that the page has gotten hundreds of reviews—leading to an overall positive review of four out of five stars.\n\nThis acts as social proof that many others have found the guide useful. Suggesting that you will, too.\n\nMain takeaways:\n\nLink to a glossary if your pillar page contains technical terms readers may not understand\nSignal your page’s credibility by linking readers to other authoritative websites on the topic.

Like:\n\nWhy local SEO is important\nHow local SEO works\nHow to do local SEO\nLocal SEO tools\n\nThe page puts these topics in a “sticky” table of contents that stays in place even as the reader scrolls down. To help the reader conveniently jump to different sections from any part of the page.\n\nThe page uses short paragraphs to improve readability.\n\nAnd it includes “Further reading” links at the end of certain topic sections. So users can learn more about these topics.\n\nThe page also demonstrates how readers can use Semrush’s tools to improve their local SEO.\n\nWhich drives awareness of them. And encourages account sign-ups.\n\nMain takeaways:\n\nDefine the subject of your what-is pillar page at the start of it. Don’t bury this explanation further down the page or make it difficult to find.\nAfter defining the subject, provide readers with related information they may find useful. Both on the pillar page and via the relevant resources you’ve linked to.\nIf the page features your products or services, show how these can solve the reader’s pain points. Instead of merely listing their features.\n5. “What Is Engineering?” by Live Science\n\nThis page by Live Science explains what engineering is.
