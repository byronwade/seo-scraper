And are much more time-efficient than a manual approach to keyword research.\n\nHere are some of the main advantages of using competitor keyword analysis tools:\n\nImprove SEO rankings. Learn how your competitors optimize their content for specific keywords. To identify ways to improve your own rankings for those terms.\nIdentify content gaps. Discover keywords your competitors rank for that you do not. This can help you create new content to attract traffic currently going to your competitors.\nOptimize PPC bids. Study which keywords your competitors bid on to find terms with a high potential for clicks and conversions. You can choose to compete directly on these high-value keywords. Or strategically focus on less competitive terms to optimize your ad spend.\nImprove ad copy. Analyze the messaging and calls to action (CTAs) competitors use. To refine your own copy for the same keywords.\nBenchmark performance. Compare your keyword rankings, traffic, and engagement metrics with those of your competitors. This will help you track the progress of your own search engine marketing efforts over time.\n\nFurther reading: How to Find & Analyze Competitor Keywords\n\nTop 6 Competitor Keyword Analysis Tools\n\nLet’s compare the best competitor keyword analysis tools (free and paid) and discuss their top use cases:\n\n1. Organic Research Tool\n\nSemrush’s Organic Research is a keyword competitor analysis tool that lets you see who your organic search rivals are. And what keywords they rank for.\n\nTo start, enter your domain and hit “Search.”\n\nNext, open the “Competitors” report. \n\nHere, you’ll see a graph showing the main competitors for your domain based on their organic traffic and the number of keywords they rank for.\n\nScroll down to see a full list of competitor sites. \n\nBy default, sites are listed in order of “Competition Level.” This metric is calculated based on the number of keywords you and your competitor rank for. And how many of these keywords you have in common.\n\nClick on any competitor domain to learn more about the specific terms they rank for.\n\nThen, under the “Positions” report, you’ll see a full list of your competitor’s organic keywords.\n\nThe table provides metrics such as the estimated organic traffic each keyword drives to the competitor. And tells you which URL ranks for that term.\n\nThe “Position Changes” report allows you to see how your competitor’s rankings fluctuate over time.\n\nAt the top of the report, you’ll see two widgets: “Position Changes Trend” and “Top Page Changes.” \n\nThese provide an overview of the domain’s recent ranking gains and losses. And tell you which pages have experienced the biggest traffic changes.\n\nFurther down the report, you’ll see a full breakdown of recent position and traffic changes for different keywords.\n\nPosition changes fall into one of four categories: \n\nNew\nImproved\nDeclined\nLost \n\nFilter results based on these categories by using the “Position changes” drop-down. To find key opportunities to capitalize on competitor drops. Or to identify trending topics you might want to target.\n\nTop Use Cases for This Tool\n\nOrganic Research is an ideal first stop for gathering competitive intelligence on your rivals’ organic keyword strategies.\n\nThe “Position Changes” report is especially helpful for identifying current weak spots in your competitors’ campaigns. \n\nFor example, if a rival’s rankings are dropping for a particular keyword, it could mean their content is outdated. You could potentially create better, more up-to-date content targeting that term to capture more of the search demand for yourself.\n\nPricing\n\nOrganic Research is available on all Semrush plans.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of pricing and limits for each plan:\n\nFree: $0.00/month (10 requests per day, 10 results per report, no historical data)\nPro: $139.95/month (3,000 requests per day, 10,000 results per report, no historical data)\nGuru: $249.95/month (5,000 requests per day, 30,000 results per report, historical data included)\nBusiness: $499.95/month (10,000 requests per day, 50,000 results per report, historical data included)\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ SEO Results\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Keyword Gap Tool\n\nKeyword Gap allows you to compare your site’s keyword profile with up to four rival sites.\n\nThis Semrush tool shows how much your keywords overlap with your competitors. And which unique keywords your competitors rank for that you don’t.\n\nYou can use Keyword Gap to analyze organic, paid, and PLA (product listing ad) keywords.\n\nStart by adding your domain and your competitors’ domains. And specify the type of keywords you want to analyze.\n\nThen hit “Compare.”\n\nYou’ll see a graphic representing the keyword profile of each competitor. And how much they overlap with each other.\n\nScroll down to the main keyword table. This shows how each domain’s keyword profile intersects.\n\nThere are several intersection types:\n\nShared: Keywords all sites rank for\nMissing: Keywords all sites rank for, except yours\nWeak: Keywords all sites rank for, but you’re ranking lowest\nStrong: Keywords for which you rank higher than the other sites\nUntapped: Keywords you don’t rank for but another site does\nUnique: Keywords only you rank for\n\nLooking at “Missing” and “Weak” keywords helps you see where your site falls short compared to your competitors. Targeting these terms could help you capture some of the share of this traffic.\n\nMeanwhile, “Strong” and “Unique” keywords represent your site’s competitive strengths. You could choose to double-down on high-volume terms within these categories to maximize your ranking potential. \n\nYou could also begin targeting “Untapped” terms so your competitors no longer enjoy uncontested rankings. \n\nPro tip\n\nYou can quickly identify which competitor ranks highest for a given keyword by looking for the green box on each row.\n \n\nTop Use Cases for This Tool\n\nKeyword Gap lets you quickly gauge where you stand in relation to your competitors.\n\nThe tool makes it easy to spot keyword opportunities to help you keep up with (and get ahead of) the pack.\n\nYou can also use the tool to find keywords competitors rank for but that have little or no advertising competition. You could potentially run a PPC campaign to target these terms and take some of the traffic for yourself. \n\nPricing\n\nKeyword Gap is available on all Semrush plans.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of pricing:\n\nFree: $0.00/month (up to 10 searches per day)\nPro: $139.95/month\nGuru: $249.95/month \nBusiness: $499.95/month \n\nFind New Keyword Opportunities’\n\nwith the Keyword Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Advertising Research Tool\n\nThe Advertising Research tool lets you identify your closest paid search competitors, see which keywords they target, and view real examples of their ads.\n\nIt’s similar to the Organic Research tool we mentioned earlier. But for paid keywords.\n\nTo see who your main PPC competitors are, enter your domain into the search bar. Then click “Search.”\n\nNext, head to the “Competitors” tab. \n\nHere, you’ll see a chart visualizing how much paid traffic you receive and how many keywords you pay for compared with competitors.\n\nScroll down to see a full list of your paid search competitors.\n\nClick on any competitor site to dive into the details of their paid ad strategy.\n\nAt the top of the “Positions” report, you’ll see:\n\nHow many keywords your competitor targets\nHow much monthly traffic they receive from those keywords\nThe total estimated cost for those ads\n\nScroll down to see a full list of all the keywords your competitor is ranking for in paid results.\n\nThe table includes metrics like the position, search volume, cost per click (CPC), landing page URL, and estimated paid traffic for each keyword.\n\nAnd to view the specific ad that appears for each keyword, hover over the green “Ad” icon in the “Ad” column.\n\nTop Use Cases for This Tool\n\nAdvertising Research provides a comprehensive view of your competitors’ PPC campaigns.\n\nThe tool allows you to see where your rivals are gaining and losing ad positions. And analyze real examples of ads they’ve run in the past. \n\nYou can then use these insights to improve your own paid campaigns. For example, you might analyze the ads that worked best for a competitor for specific keywords. And emulate those copy elements in your own messaging. \n\nFurther reading: The 6 Best PPC Keyword Tools to Elevate Your Ad Campaigns\n\nPricing\n\nYou can access Advertising Research on all Semrush plans.\n\nHere are the prices and tool limits for each plan:\n\nFree: $0.00/month (10 requests per day, 10 results per report, no historical data)\nPro: $139.95/month (3,000 requests per day, 10,000 results per report, no historical data)\nGuru: $249.95/month (5,000 requests per day, 30,000 results per report, historical data included)\nBusiness: $499.95/month (10,000 requests per day, 50,000 results per report, historical data included)\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Google Keyword Planner\n\nKeyword Planner is a free keyword research tool from Google.\n\nThe tool is primarily designed to help advertisers plan their PPC campaigns. But you can also use it to gather competitive keyword insights.\n\nYou can use Keyword Planner for free. You’ll just need to set up a Google Ads account to use it.\n\nTo get set up, go to Google Ads and hit “Start now” to sign in.\n\nNext, click “Skip campaign creation.” This lets you use the tool without creating an ad campaign.\n\nFollow the setup instructions. \n\nThen go to the “Tools” section in the Google Ads menu. Under “Planning,” select “Keyword Planner.”\n\nSelect “Discover new keywords.”\n\nNext, select “Start with a website” and enter a competitor’s URL.\n\nClick “Get results.”\n\nThe tool will then generate a list of keywords relevant to the content on your competitor’s site. \n\nYou can then examine these suggestions to identify gaps in your own keyword list. \n\nIn particular, look for any high-volume keywords that are related to your business that you don’t currently target.\n\nFurther reading: How to Use Google Keyword Planner to Find Keywords\n\nTop Use Cases for This Tool\n\nKeyword Planner is an easy-to-use tool that lets you see which keywords Google associates with your competitors. \n\nThis gives you an idea of which terms your competitors may be targeting. And it helps you uncover new keywords that you might not have considered.\n\nHowever, you may need to run an active Google Ads campaign (i.e., spend money) to unlock precise keyword data. Such as exact search volume numbers and detailed cost-per-click (CPC) estimates.\n\nBut as a free tool, it can be a useful place to start your competitor keyword research.\n\nPricing\n\nGoogle Keyword Planner is free with a Google Ads account.\n\n5. SpyFu\n\nSpyFu is a competitive intelligence tool for SEO and PPC marketers.\n\nIt lets you see which keywords your competitors target, how much traffic they get from them, and how their search positions have changed over time.\n\nStart by entering a competitor’s URL into the search bar and clicking “SEARCH.”\n\nThis will take you to an overview, where you’ll find several high-level performance metrics of your competitor’s SEO and PPC campaigns.\n\nFor example, it shows how much of the site’s Google traffic comes from paid versus organic search. \n\nIn the “SEO Research” tab, you’ll find multiple reports about your competitor’s organic keywords.\n\nAnd in the “PPC Research” tab, you can view a list of your competitor’s top paid keywords.\n\nTop Use Cases for This Tool\n\nSpyFu gives you a basic understanding of your competitors’ PPC and SEO keywords.
