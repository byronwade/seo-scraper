  "content": "What Is Page Speed?\n\nPage speed (also called “load speed”) measures how fast the content of a page loads.\n\nBut it’s important to clarify: \n\n“Page speed” is not a single metric.\n\nContent loads in different stages. Which is why page speed is an umbrella term for the many ways to measure how quickly content appears on a page. Like:\n\nTime to First Byte (TTFB): How long it takes for the page to begin loading\nFirst Contentful Paint (FCP): How long it takes for the user to see the first element of a page (like an image)\nFirst Input Delay (FID): How long it takes for your site to respond to a user input (like a button click)\nOnload time: How long it takes to fully load the content of a page\n\nSometimes, the first thing a user sees is a blank page. Then, some elements appear. And finally, the full page loads.\n\nPage speed metrics measure each of these events separately. To help you understand how fast your page is. And how fast it should be based on Google’s thresholds.\n\nPro tip​​​​​​\n\nTo get an idea of how fast or slow your pages are, plug your URL into Google's PageSpeed Insights.\n \n\nOr use Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n \n\nFrom your Site Audit dashboard, click on “View details” under “Site Performance.”\n \n\n  \nYou’ll get a full report. With details on how quickly each of your pages load.\n\n  \nClick on “# issues” beside “Slow page (HTML) load speed.” To get a full list of your pages that load slowly.\n \n\nKeep reading to discover how page speed affects SEO and ways to improve it.\n\nCheck Your Page Speed\n\nwith Semrush Site Audit\n\nCheck Your Page Speed →\nWhy Is Page Speed Important for SEO?\n\nPage load speed is a confirmed ranking factor on desktop and mobile. In fact, Google says extremely slow pages are less likely to rank high.\n\nWhich means Google algorithms take page speed (and other signals) into account when deciding how to rank your site.\n\nGoogle cares how fast your page is because slow sites make for a poor user experience. \n\nIn fact, a user is three times more likely to bounce (i.e., leave your page) if your page takes longer than three seconds to load, according to Google.\n\nThey recommend making sure all your pages reach the \"Good\" thresholds for key page speed metrics. \n\nHow to Check Your Page Load Time\n\nHere are two of the best tools to check your page load time. And how to use them.\n\nGoogle PageSpeed Insights\n\nGoogle PageSpeed Insights (PSI) is a free tool that measures a webpage’s performance. \n\nIn addition to page load time, you can use PSI to measure Core Web Vitals (i.e., three important user experience metrics), view performance data, and get recommendations for improving your site.\n\nNote\n\nGoogle PageSpeed Insights can only tell you how fast a particular page is. You can’t use it to measure overall site load speed.\n\nTo begin, open the tool. And paste the URL of the page you want to analyze into the search bar.\n\nThen, hit “Analyze.”\n\nAt the top of the report, you’ll see an overall assessment of page performance: “Passed” or “Failed.”\n\nAlong with Core Web Vital metrics. And other important page speed metrics like FCP, TTFB, and FID.\n\nTip\n\nRead our PageSpeed Insights guide for a deeper explanation of these recommendations and tips on how to improve your results.\n\nSemrush Site Audit\n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to check the page speed and web performance for all your pages. Not just one.\n\nSite Audit includes over 140 on-page and technical SEO checks. Which makes it one of the most useful website auditing tools out there.\n\nTo get started, open the tool, enter your URL in the search bar, and click “Start Audit.”\n\nThen, configure your Site Audit. And click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nYou’ll see a dashboard similar to this one:\n\nClick on “View details” under “Site Performance.” To check your load speed, performance issues, and more. \n\nTake note of the “Page (HTML) Load Speed” and “Avg. Page (HTML) Load Speed” sections. To see how quickly your pages load, measured in seconds.\n\nYou’ll also see a list of “Performance Issues.” When fixing these issues, prioritize “Errors.” Then, move on to “Warnings.”\n\nPro tip\n\nAlso check out your “Core Web Vitals” report. By clicking on “View details” under “Core Web Vitals” from your main Site Audit dashboard.\n \n\n  \nIt shows your Core Web Vitals score per page (and recommended improvements):\n \n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nCheck Now →\n8 Ways to Improve Your Page Speed SEO\n\nWhen you analyze your page (or site) with a page speed tool, you’ll receive many recommendations for improving its performance.\n\nLet’s go through the eight most effective ways to speed up your pages. \n\n1. Choose the Right Image Format\n\nDifferent types of images require different image file formats.\n\nSome formats are lighter than others because they offer higher compression levels. Choose the right format for each image to lower your page’s load time.\n\nHere are the most common formats and how to use them:\n\nJPEG: Good for real-world images, like photographs\nPNG: Good for screenshots, designs, logos, or images with a higher level of detail\nGIFs: Avoid this format, as it will slow down your page. If you need an animated image, consider converting your GIF into a video.\nWebP: Good for all types of images because it’s lighter than JPEG and PNG (up to three times smaller, in fact). However, not every browser supports WebP images yet. So we’d recommend using JPEG and PNG for now. \n\nPro tip\n\nIf you use WordPress, plugins like EWWW Optimizer convert your images into WebP. But the plugin will show a JPEG or PNG version of the image if the user opens your site with a browser that doesn’t support WebP files. \n\n2. Compress Your Images\n\nImages often contribute to slow pages. Image SEO is a key part of website speed optimization.\n\nYour goal should be to keep images as small as possible without compromising quality or user experience.\n\nSay you want to upload an image that is 1MB and measures 3024 x 4032 pixels. \n\nResize your image using a free image resizer like PicResize.\n\nUpload your image to the tool. And select how much smaller you want your image to become (e.g., 50% smaller).\n\nAfter you make your image as small as possible without compromising quality, use an image optimizer like ImageOptim to shrink it even further.\n\nSimply run your image through the tool, and it’ll do its magic.\n\nAlways do this before you upload images to your site. \n\nPro tip\n\nIf you use WordPress as your content management system (CMS), optimize images with a plugin like Smush. It lets you optimize images in bulk to save time. \n\n3. Enable Browser Caching\n\nBrowser caching is when a user’s browser temporarily stores webpage data. So, when the user returns to the page, it loads faster.\n\nThe first time a user enters your page, their browser stores elements like images or CSS files. That way, the browser doesn’t need to send as many requests when the user returns.\n\nThis improves the experience of returning users. But it won’t make a difference for users entering your site for the first time.\n\nTo enable browser caching on a WordPress site, use plugins like W3 Total Cache or WP Rocket.\n\nAdvanced tip\n\nIf you don’t use WordPress, you can add browser caching rules to your .htaccess file. (But you can run into issues if you make a mistake, so it’s a good idea to consult with a developer.)\n\n4. Minify JavaScript, CSS, and HTML\n\nMinifying JavaScript, CSS, and HTML reduces file size. Which can improve your page speed.\n\nIt removes line breaks, white space, and other unnecessary elements in the code. So computers can read it faster.\n\nThis is what standard CSS code looks like: \n\nbody {\nfont: 36px Arial, sans-serif;\n}\n/* Main container */\n#container {\ncolor: white;\nbackground: #ffbd17;\nwidth: 630px;\nheight: 160px;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\n}\n/* Content */\n#content {\nbackground: #333;\nflex: 0 0 10px;\n}\n\nAnd this is what it looks like after minification:\n\nbody{font:36px \nArial,sans-serif}#container{color:#fff;background:#ffbd17;width:630px;\nheight:160px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}\n#content{background:#333;flex:0 0 10px}\n\nHow do you know if minification is necessary?\n\nSemrush’s Site Audit tool flags pages on your site with unminified JavaScript and CSS files. \n\nOnce you know which pages are affected, it’s time to take action. \n\nYou can use an online minifier tool to minify your files. Or, if you own a WordPress website, a plugin like WP Rocket can help you minify your code. \n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n5. Use a Content Delivery Network\n\nA content delivery network (CDN) is a group of interconnected servers distributed across different locations. They bring your site “closer” to each user.\n\nAnd pages load faster for users who are geographically close to the location of the main site’s server. \n\nA CDN works like this:\n\nYou cache your site on a CDN \nA user sends a request to open your site\nThe server that’s closest to the user delivers the site \n\nSay your origin server is in Los Angeles.\n\nIf a user in Italy tries to access your site, your CDN will find the closest server in the user’s network. (Let’s say it’s in France.) The CDN will then deliver a cached version of your site to the server in France.\n\nSince Italy is much closer to France than to Los Angeles, your website loading speed will improve.\n\nGood examples of CDNs are Cloudflare and Jetpack.\n\n6. Improve Your Server Response Time\n\nSlow server response times can significantly delay page loading.\n\nWhen a user tries to access a webpage, the browser makes a request to fetch that content. The server receives the request and loads the page content.\n\nTo improve server response time, consider upgrading your hosting plan. Shared hosting is often slower than dedicated or VPS hosting. If you're experiencing consistent slowdowns, it might be time to switch to a more robust hosting solution.\n\nA few more things you can try include the following:\n\nOptimize your server’s application logic and configuration\nIndex database tables or upgrade to a faster database system\nAdd more random-access memory (RAM) and faster processors\n\nYou will likely need to consult with your hosting provider or a developer to implement these changes.\n\n7. Reduce Redirects\n\nRedirects can slow down your page load time.\n\nA redirect occurs when a user clicks on one URL but is automatically sent to a different URL.\n\nLet’s say a page's URL changes from \"techblog.com/best-smartphones-2023\" to \"techblog.com/best-smartphones-2024.\" The redirect automatically sends users to the new page.\n\nIn some cases, a page might redirect several times before reaching the final destination. This is known as a redirect chain.\n\nEvery redirect adds an extra step in loading a page. Which makes the overall process slower.\n\nTo audit your site for unnecessary redirects, use the Site Audit tool.\n\nGo to the “Issues” tab. Type “redirect” into the search bar provided.\n\nYou’ll see a list of Errors, Warnings, and Issues related to redirects. Like:\n\nHow many redirect chains and loops you have\nHow many temporary redirects you have\nHow many permanent redirects you have\n\nClick on the link within each identified redirect error to see the list of affected pages.\n\nThe report will show each page’s redirect type and number of redirects:\n\nIf you’ve identified any redirect chains or loops, the next step is to delete the unnecessary redirects.\n\nTip\n\nIf you’re a WordPress user, there are free plugins (like Easy Redirect Manager, Redirection, and Simple Page Redirect) to help you create or change redirects.\n\n8. Reduce HTTP Requests\n\nHTTP requests happen when web browsers send “requests” to a website’s server for more information. \n\nSay a user visits a page. The server gets a request from the browser and answers with a file containing information the user needs to view the page. (This file could contain text, images, multimedia, etc.) The user can’t view what’s in the file until the request is complete.\n\nBut if that file doesn’t contain all the information the user needs to view the page, the browser will send another request. \n\nThe more requests, the more your page speed slows down. The user will have to wait longer to view the entire page.\n\nAim to reduce HTTP requests (or to make them load faster) to improve your page speed.\n\nTo view a page’s number of HTTP requests, use Google Chrome.\n\nOpen your page on Chrome. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose “Inspect.” \n\nYou’ll see Google’s developer tools (also called Chrome DevTools). Go to the “Network” tab. \n\nAt first, the panel will have few to zero entries. Reload the page to collect data.\n\nYou’ll see all HTTP requests, their sizes, and the time it takes to load them. These include requests for images, plugins, JavaScript or CSS files, and many more. \n\nYou can also see the total number of requests in the bottom-left corner of the inspect window. \n\nThis number is a good way to track your progress. The fewer requests, the better. \n\nFor context, the average page sends around 70 HTTP requests. However, there isn’t a specific number to aim for. Use the average number of requests on your webpages as guidance to track your progress.\n\nOptimize Your Technical SEO\n\nPage speed is just one piece of the technical SEO puzzle. But it's a crucial one for improving both search rankings and user experience.\n\nTo get a comprehensive view of your site's technical health, including page speed insights, try the Semrush Site Audit tool.\n\nIt provides a detailed analysis of your website's performance and offers actionable recommendations for improvement.\n\nStart optimizing your site today with a free site audit.
