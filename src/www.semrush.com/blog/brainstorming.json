  "content": "Many successful marketing teams use content brainstorming to generate ideas on what to create.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll share the tips and techniques you can use to run brainstorming sessions effectively.\n\nBut let’s cover the basics first.\n\nWhat Is Brainstorming?\n\nBrainstorming is when a group of people share spontaneous ideas as proposed solutions to a problem. It’s a process designed to encourage creativity and collaboration.\n\nFor example, in a content brainstorm, participants might verbally share blog post ideas while one person writes them down on a whiteboard.\n\nGenerally, the goal is to generate as many ideas as possible. And refine them later.\n\nSo, participants are encouraged to share whatever comes to mind. And avoid passing judgment on other people’s ideas.\n\nWhat Is Content Brainstorming?\n\nContent brainstorming is brainstorming to come up with content ideas—i.e., concepts for blog posts, videos, infographics, and other types of content.\n\nIt can be an efficient way to produce unique, diverse, and plentiful ideas for a content calendar.\n\nBecause it:\n\nGathers ideas from multiple people\nAllows people to iterate on others’ ideas\nLiberates participants from fear of judgment\n\nAnd the more content ideas you have, the easier it will be to find ones that work for your content marketing strategy.\n\n9 Content Brainstorming Ideas\n\nExperiment with these contentbrainstormingideas to see what works best for your team:\n\n1. Use Semrush’s Topic Research Tool\n\nWith Semrush’s Topic Research tool, you can find popular and trending subtopics in your niche. Which make great launchpads for your content brainstorm.\n\nEnter a main topic to base your search around.\n\nThen, choose your country and click “Get content ideas.”\n\nThe tool will present a variety of subtopic ideas. \n\nWhich you can sort by:\n\nVolume: The average number of times the subtopic is Googled each month\nDifficulty: How hard it will be to rank highly for the subtopic in Google, expressed as a percentage called “Keyword difficulty”\nTopic Efficiency: A measure of the subtopic’s overall SEO potential, based on the subtopic’s volume and difficulty\n\nSwitch the toggle to focus on trending subtopics, which are marked with a flame icon.\n\nIf you need more inspiration, click “Show more” on any subtopic.\n\nYou’ll see:\n\nHeadlines: The top 10 headlines for the main keyword, prioritized by which ones have the most backlinks (links from other sites)\nQuestions: A list of related questions that you might want to answer in your content\nRelated searches: Some associated search queries that show up on Google\n\nGet Content Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Create a Mind Map\n\nA mind map is a visual representation of connected ideas.\n\nHere’s an example of what a mind map can look like (this one is from within Keyword Strategy Builder and based on related keywords):\n\nYou start in the center with your main or pillar topic. Then, branch off into related subtopics and keep branching off until you have your final ideas.\n\nThis process allows you to build ideas one step at a time.\n\nYou can do mind mapping with a pen and paper. But we recommend using a tool like Miro. To make it easy to collaborate and create more complex diagrams.\n\n3. Curate and Reference a Swipe File\n\nA swipe file is a collection of content you can get inspiration from.\n\nFor example, you might jot down catchy headlines to use as models you want to emulate. Or bookmark blog posts that cover topics you want to write about.\n\nNo matter how or where you store it, keep your inspirational content organized so it’s easy to browse through when you’re brainstorming topics.\n\nPocket is a great tool for saving articles, because you can add tags and highlight key passages.\n\nNote that a swipe file is often curated naturally over time. As you spot great content in your day-to-day life. \n\nBut you can seek out inspiration purposefully. We’ll explain how in the next section.\n\n4. Seek Out Great Content Examples\n\nLooking at content marketing examples is one of the best ways to get inspiration during a brainstorm.\n\nSearch for useful ideas and roundups on Google. With queries like this:\n\n“[your niche] content examples”\n“[your topic] content ideas”\n“[content format] marketing examples”\n\nYou can also get inspiration from:\n\nCase studies on agency and awards websites (e.g., The Drum Awards)\nOnline design portfolios (e.g., samples shared on Behance and Dribbble)\nBlogs and social media profiles in your niche (e.g., a competitor’s Instagram account)\n\nTip\n\nUse Semrush’s EyeOn tool to get notifications about your competitors’ social and blog activity. Or check out our other competitor analysis tools.\n\n5. Ask Your Audience for Ideas\n\nYou want to give your target audience what they want—so why not ask them for ideas?\n\nJust add a message asking readers what they’d like to see from you to your social media platforms or email newsletter. \n\nLike podcaster Natalie Brunell did here: \n\nThen, browse through the suggestions during your content brainstorm.\n\n6. Perform Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research is the process of finding what your target audience searches for using Google (or other search engines).\n\nThis is particularly helpful if you’re brainstorming ideas to support your search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. Because it tells you what content in your niche is in demand.\n\nTo get started, go to Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a term to base your research around, then choose your country and click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will provide a list of “Broad Match” keywords that contain your starting term(s) or a close variation.\n\nIn the “Volume” column, you’ll see how many searches each keyword typically gets each month.\n\nWe recommend that you filter for keywords with informational search intent.\n\nThese are queries that people use to find information. So, they’re good for prompting content ideas.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n7. Try the 6-3-5 Method\n\nThe 6-3-5 method is a brainstorming technique that involves six participants. But it can be adapted for other group sizes.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nEach participant receives a piece of paper (or online document) with a challenge at the top—e.g., “Come up with video ideas related to remote working.” And they get five minutes to silently add three ideas.\n\nParticipants then swap sheets and add three more ideas. And repeat until they’ve contributed to every challenge.\n\nIt’ll take just over half an hour to generate 108 ideas (six participants x three ideas x six rounds). At the end, you can discuss your results and gather any extra ideas.\n\nThis method allows everyone in the group to contribute and build on each other’s ideas. While providing space for independent thought.\n\n8. Prompt Ideas with Random Words\n\nUse a random word generator tool to give you words or phrases to use as prompts. Then, challenge your team to brainstorm content ideas or headlines around them.\n\nThis is a great way to inspire out-of-the-box thinking. And while you might not use all the initial ideas, they can spark interesting thoughts and discussions.\n\nFor example, here are three randomly generated words and content ideas they inspired:\n\nRegret: Why You Won’t Regret Going Freelance: 5 Parents Share Their Stories\nCommon: The Common Denominators of Successful Remote Teams\nHold: How to Put Work on Hold When You Have a Home Office\n9. Adapt Ideas with the SCAMPER Framework\n\nSCAMPER is a set of techniques for generating new ideas from existing ideas. \n\nSo, it can help you put a new twist on an existing piece of content. Or extract more value from ideas you’ve already brainstormed. \n\nLet’s break the acronym down:\n\nS\n\n\t\n\nSubstitute\n\n\t\n\nReplace an element of the original idea with something else\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\t\n\nCombine\n\n\t\n\nMerge the idea with another idea\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\t\n\nAdapt\n\n\t\n\nChange the idea to suit a new audience or format\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\t\n\nMagnify or minify\n\n\t\n\nPut more or less emphasis on a particular part of the idea\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\t\n\nPut to another use\n\n\t\n\nThink of ways to repurpose the idea\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\t\n\nEliminate\n\n\t\n\nRefine the idea by removing an element\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\t\n\nRearrange or reverse\n\n\t\n\nApproach the idea from another perspective\n\nLet’s say we have a productivity guide for remote workers.\n\nWe could:\n\nSubstitute the existing stock images with original infographics\nCombine the article with a weekly email newsletter that delivers bite-sized productivity hacks\nAdapt the article to focus specifically on remote workers with young children\nMagnify the human aspect of the article by incorporating success stories\nPut it to another use by repurposing it into a downloadable ebook\nEliminate commonplace advice to create a guide that focuses on novel tips\nReverse the idea by sharing productivity myths rather than productivity hacks\nBest Practices for Content Brainstorming\n\nTo get the most out of your content brainstorming session, follow these best practices:\n\nCreate Effective Prompts to Guide Your Efforts\n\nFirst, you need to define the goal of your brainstorming session. You can then create one or more prompts to direct participants’ thinking.\n\nAvoid vague prompts like the one below. These can cause participants to become overwhelmed and unfocused. \n\n❌ Brainstorm content ideas\n\nEqually, avoid being too specific. Prompts like this can stifle creativity:\n\n❌ Brainstorm infographic ideas that discuss the ergonomic benefits of adjustable office chairs with lumbar support, targeted specifically at freelance graphic designers working in home offices\n\nInstead, try to land somewhere in the middle. Only introduce constraints if they’re necessary for the goal. Or to give your participants some direction.\n\nFor example, it’s helpful to focus on the relevant platform(s) if you’re doing social media brainstorming. \n\n✅ Brainstorm video ideas that will allow us to engage freelancers on TikTok\n\nSet Ground Rules\n\nIn addition to sharing the goal with participants, make it clear what’s expected of them during the brainstorming session.\n\nHere are some rules you might want to adopt:\n\nShare any ideas that come to mind, even if they seem outlandish or impractical\nAvoid evaluating or critiquing other people’s ideas\nUse other people’s ideas to spark your own creativity\nAvoid distractions (e.g., keep laptops closed)\n\nIt’s also best to establish a time constraint for each brainstorming session or activity. \n\nTry working in five-minute bursts with short breaks in between. This should help your participants stay focused.\n\nStart with an Ice-Breaker Activity\n\nIce-breaker activities can help participants feel more comfortable before the brainstorming process begins. Especially if they’re working with an unfamiliar group of people.\n\nThese activities can also get participants into a creative mindset.\n\nFor example, you could:\n\nPlay a trivia quiz on Sporcle\nWatch and discussing a relevant video \nTake turns adding sentences to build a story\nPractice Effective Record-Keeping\n\nVisibly record ideas during the content brainstorming session so participants can use them to spark ideas of their own. And so they’re not forgotten later.\n\nYou could ask one person to take notes. But they might struggle to capture everything discussed. And get little opportunity to contribute their thoughts.\n\nInstead, ask everyone to jot down their own ideas: \n\nIf you’re brainstorming in person, you could use sticky notes and post them on the wall\nIf you’re brainstorming online, you can use a cloud-based document or digital whiteboard\n\nBut let participants know that you’ll polish the notes later. \n\nThat way, everyone can focus on thinking. Rather than note-keeping.\n\nTry Different Brainstorming Techniques\n\nExperiment with some of the different brainstorming techniques we mentioned to see what works best for your team.\n\nWhile some marketers prefer a traditional approach, others will benefit from using certain tools and structures.\n\nPlus, different ideation methods keep things fresh. And encourage participants to think in new ways. So, they’re great for sparking creativity.\n\nWhat to Do After Brainstorming\n\nOnce your content brainstorm is complete, compile your team’s notes in a single document.\n\nYou can then start to polish and prioritize content ideas. Considering factors like:\n\nSEO potential: How many people are searching for this topic and how high might you rank in search results?\nTarget audience: Does the topic align with your target audience’s needs and preferences?\nResources: Do you have the skills, tools, and time required to create the content?\nMarketing goals: How much will this content support sales, lead generation, etc.?\nRelevance: Does the topic align with your brand identity? And is it relevant right now?\n\nTo streamline the process, collect content ideas and data with Semrush’s Topic Research tool.\n\nGet Content Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nThis post was updated in 2024.
