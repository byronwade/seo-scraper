  "content": "If marketers know one thing for sure, it’s this: content marketing trends are constantly changing. \n\nAccording to industry experts, artificial intelligence (AI) dominates the 2024 content marketing trends.\n\nWith the explosion of AI technology over the last two years, the need for the human touch has never been greater. \n\nUsing fresh data and insights from our 2024 AI Content Marketing Report, here are nine trends to guide your content marketing strategy this year.\n\nTrend #1: AI Should Be Used by Humans for Humans\n\nTL;DR ​​​​​​\n\nAI should be used to improve content quality and conduct deeper research—not to replace human writers.\n\n2023 brought an explosion of new AI technology with the promise of making marketing easier. \n\nCompanies that thought AI tools were only for saving time were wrong.\n\nMichael Brenner, Founder of Marketing Insider Group, understands the power of implementing AI tools in your content strategy. \n\nWe use AI to help us understand our audience better, to spot the most important trends, and to find data and research that would normally take us more time. All this helps us to spend more time on what we do best: writing.\n\nMichael Brenner, Founder of Marketing Insider Group\n\nUsing AI as the foundation for your content, you can build upon AI-generated drafts. \n\nNext, your writers and editors can enrich it with personal stories to connect with your audience on a deeper level. \n\nBrenner says, \n\nThe best content is written by humans for humans. After AI helps us lay the groundwork, our in-house writers step in to add stories, depth, and visual support to each piece of content.\n\nMichael Brenner, Founder of Marketing Insider Group\n\nSo, you might be wondering if you can create high-quality content with AI.\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\nOur survey of over 2,600 businesses revealed that 79% saw an improvement in content quality thanks to using AI.\n\nBut, as you can see, there’s a caveat: AI only works great when you combine it with human oversight.\n\nOur survey found that 93% of businesses review AI-generated content, which includes checking its tone of voice and style, as well as consulting editors and subject matter experts (SMEs).\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nAlways create content with your audience and their experience in mind\nAI should be used as a tool to empower content creation, not to replace writers and editors\nAI can help you research content and improve its quality—but you shouldn’t depend solely on AI when creating content\nTrend #2: AI Is Changing Search Engine Mechanisms—But You Can Adapt\n\nTL;DR\n\nAI will alter the way search engines and rankings work. It’s key to keep track of those changes and adapt your strategy.\n\nAccording to Kyle Byers, Growth Marketing Director at Semrush, we will witness an unprecedented volume of low-quality content in 2024.\n\nAt the same time, AI is set to enhance the quality of SEO content and elevate user expectations.\n\nThis trend is likely because numerous brands might view AI as a quick and straightforward solution for content generation—often bypassing the expertise of professional writers or editors.\n\nGenerative AI tools like ContentShake AI and ChatGPT are simplifying content creation for teams, regardless of their size.\n\nHowever, with the inflow of this low-quality content, it will become more crucial to show evidence of human input.\n\nGoogle's continued emphasis on E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) highlights the significance of this aspect. These are the same attributes that users are actively seeking. They desire content that is both accurate and genuine.\n\nAnother upcoming challenge is Google’s Search Generative Experience in the SERPs, offering AI-generated responses to numerous search queries. \n\nSource\n\nThis might influence users to spend more time in the Google search results and less time clicking through links.\n\nWondering how you can protect your website traffic against these risks?\n\nByers says:\n\nTo compete against that, content marketers should provide experiences that can’t be easily replaced by simple AI summaries. Your work needs to be more compelling to users than ever.\n\nKyle Byers, Growth Marketing Director at Semrush\n\nYou can compete with Google’s new search experience by making your content stand out. For example, you can:\n\nEmbed multimedia content in your articles\nAdd other interactive elements\nPay attention to the smallest of details\nProvide detailed guidelines and useful examples\nShowcase your brand’s unique voice\nCollaborate with subject matter experts and guest contributors \n\nVisit Lake Tahoe, for example, increases visitor interest by embedding relevant YouTube videos in their blog posts. \n\nTheir posts are structured to keep users engaged and scrolling through the content to the bottom of the page.\n\nSource\n\nAdding interactive and visual elements to your content will significantly increase user satisfaction and engagement.\n\nThe changes brought by AI don’t end there. \n\nOverall, we can expect search engines to get better at understanding and interpreting user queries, understanding the context behind searches, personalizing search results, and assessing content quality.\n\nWith more AI-generated content out there, you might want to pay special attention to off-site SEO—generating authority signals such as high-quality backlinks. \n\nCreating more research-driven, unique, and impactful content is a great way to achieve this goal.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nWith the addition of Google’s Generative AI Search and other AI-driven changes, your content needs to be as valuable as possible to compete in the search results\nAdding interactive elements to your blog posts and making them comprehensive will help you keep and hold a reader’s attention\nCreating more research-driven, unique content will remain an essential SEO tactic in 2024\nTrend #3: AI-Generated Content Can Help You Rank High and Quickly\n\nTL;DR\n\nWe have data to prove that AI can boost your SEO performance. However, there are several rules and best practices you should follow.\n\nIn our survey, we saw that 33% of businesses still don’t use AI tools for content marketing and SEO.\n\nWe also saw that a lack of understanding and concerns about AI content’s originality and quality were among the top concerns in this group.\n\nCan AI truly benefit your SEO and content strategy?\n\nLuckily, the answer is yes!\n\nBased on our research, 65% of companies that already use AI see an improvement in SEO performance.\n\nWe also saw that 55% of companies saw their AI content rank in search more than once and 76% at least once. So, don’t get stuck thinking AI-generated content edited by humans won’t perform well—it does.\n\nBut there are some best practices to follow.\n\nCombining AI with original research and expertise\n\nFirst, according to Google’s search guidance, high-quality, engaging content will rank far better in search engine results than any other content.\n\nSo, Google doesn’t care how it’s created– either written by a human or AI. \n\nWhat matters most is that the content follows E-E-A-T (Expertise, Experience, Authority, and Trustworthiness) standards.\n\nThe ideal way to approach it is to create a synergy and collective work of AI tools, subject matter experts (SMEs), and writers.\n\nFor example, you can interview a subject matter expert or conduct a survey with your customers\nThen, enter your insights into an AI tool to write a blog post or report based on the information you provided\nNext, to spruce up your draft, add the human touch. Work with a writer and/or an editor to humanize the copy\n\nThink of adding case studies, stories, or humor. These elements will attract readers to your content.\n\nTake Bankrate, for example.\n\nIn 2023, Bankrate, an authority in the personal finance space, used AI tools to aid in its content creation process. Instead of posting the first draft of AI content, Bankrate editors:\n\nReviewed and fact-checked information\nEdited their content to demonstrate E-E-A-T\nOffered a disclaimer to let readers know AI helped create their content\n\nBankrate's disclaimer lets the audience know that even though AI was used in content creation, they can still trust the validity of the content because it’s been reviewed by experts. \n\nAnother strategy you can implement is to talk to AI like you talk to real writers and content specialists. You can’t always expect to immediately get a perfect result when working with humans—and AI is no different.\n\nInstead, make sure to create detailed yet simple prompts and guide AI, the same as when you create content briefs and edit content drafts.\n\nCombining AI with SEO data\n\nRemember that many AI tools like ChatGPT don’t provide real-time SEO data on keywords, search intent, etc. \n\nTo address this, you can combine AI with SEO tools and manual research. For example, by using Semrush and manually analyzing the SERP to understand the search intent. \n\nIn our research, we saw that the majority of businesses are using different tools in addition to AI.\n\nAlternatively, automate this process with specialized writing tools like ContentShake AI.\n\nIt integrates ChatGPT's AI capabilities and Semrush's real-time SEO insights. \n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nEnter details about your business\nGet relevant and trending content ideas\nCreate ready-to-rank content in one click\nGenerate social media posts to promote it\nPublish directly to your blog\n\nThis way, you can quickly create ready-to-rank content optimized for search.\n\nFinally, you can boost your SEO strategy in other ways beyond content creation. \n\nFor example, you can ask it to optimize your existing draft for target keywords, cluster and group your keywords, improve title tags to increase CTRs, and more.\n \n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nAI leads to improved SEO—65% of companies using AI for content marketing report enhanced SEO performance.\nSuccess in AI-generated content hinges on balancing AI innovation with human expertise, ensuring originality and adherence to E-E-A-T standards.\nCombining AI with SEO data and using tools like ContentShake AI can optimize content creation, making it more relevant and effective for search rankings.\nTrend #4: AI Is Inducing a Creator Countermovement\n\nTL;DR\n\nContent filled with honesty and your brand’s personality will resonate with your audience. Be authentic and show the “behind the scenes” of your brand.\n\nRemember the days when creating content was fresh and exciting? And it didn’t feel like every brand’s content was an exact copy of the next?\n\nWell, things are changing with AI.\n\nThe emergence of AI-powered technology brings an unexpected countermovement, and it’s a content marketing strategy that all marketers will want to jump on.\n\nMelanie Deziel, Speaker, Author, and Co-Founder of Creator Kitchen, says:\n\nIn 2024, what content marketers need to do to stand out is to practice bringing our most human selves into our work. We need to show up with vulnerability, transparency, and candor.\n\nMelanie Deziel, Speaker, Author, and Co-Founder of Creator Kitchen\n\nSarah Noel Block, a marketing consultant at Tiny Marketing, agrees with Deziel:\n\nToday, internet users gravitate towards genuine interactions. They're seeking out the human touch on their screens—raw, unfiltered content that resonates more deeply than any high-production video ever could. It's a trend rooted in our desire for authenticity, to connect with real people rather than polished personas.\n\nSarah Noel Block, Founder of Tiny Marketing\n\nWe know AI tools help content creators spend less time creating content. \n\nWe found that 36% now create a long-form blog post in less than one hour—compared to 16% before using AI tools.\n\nBrands can use the time saved on creating to connect with their audiences in other ways—like adding an extra layer of human touch and stories to their content.\n\nYour audience wants to avoid seeing polished messages from your brand. Instead, they want to see:\n\nBehind the scenes\nThe bloopers and mistakes\nThe real humans who run the business\nPersonal stories\nCommunity impact\n\nFor example, E2M, a fitness company based in Charlotte, North Carolina, interacts with its community on Facebook and regularly uses live videos to engage with community members. \n\nThe E2M fitness coaches record their live workouts from their garages and basements and don’t shy away from hiding their humanity, either. \n\nPets, children, and mishaps are regular parts of their videos that help their audience connect with the brand. \n\nE2M’s live videos use Meta’s AI software to create closed captioning. This makes the brand more accessible to all members of its target audience and creates a deeper connection with the community.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nAudiences prefer genuine, behind-the-scenes content that reflects a brand's true personality.\nAI tools in content creation free up time for brands to focus on more personal, human interactions.\nBrands showing real-life elements, like E2M's unfiltered live videos, foster stronger audience relationships.\nTrend #5: The Click-Through Rates in Search Are the Priority – and AI Can Help\n\nTL;DR\n\nCompanies will continue to face decreasing CTRs in search. But AI tools can help you identify content that could be optimized to get more clicks.\n\nWe’re seeing more complex elements on SERPs—think AI-generated summaries, Featured Snippets, and so on. As a result, users may not have the same incentive to click through to see the actual pages.\n\nBut if you think improving your click-through rates (CTRs) is a lost cause, think again. \n\nOne of the hottest 2024 content marketing trends is using AI tools to conduct SEO analysis—which includes improving click-through rates of old and new content.\n\nAndy Crestodina, Co-Founder and CMO at Orbit Media, suggests using specific ChatGPT prompts to find which of your pages could use a little more razzle-dazzle in the meta and title tags. \n\nAndy says:\n\nSearch engines aim to answer searchers’ questions more efficiently by offering featured snippets, related questions, and knowledge panels in search results… However, what’s new this year is that you can use AI to increase the CTRs by adding quick yet meaningful fixes to your content.\n\nAndy Crestodina, Co-founder and CMO of Orbit Media\n\nTo determine which of your posts has a lower than expected click-through rate, you can:\n\nOpen up your Google Search Console account\nOpen the Search Results tab\nExport your data in a CSV file (you’ll need the website URL, click-through rates, and average ranking position). \n\nFor example, you can choose to only see blog post links by clicking “+ New” and specifying the page parameters. \n\nUpload the CSV file to an AI tool like ChatGPT \nEnter Andy’s prompt:\n\n“You are an SEO expert at analyzing search performance and maximizing engagement within SERPs. Which of the following pages has lower than expected CTRs based on their average search position?”\n\nUsing the results of your prompt, you can determine which of your links are performing poorly. \n\nThose are the links you need to focus on. \n\nNext, you can change the title tag and optimize the meta description to increase the page’s CTR.\n\nDon’t forget, you can ask AI to help you write and enhance your meta tags too.\n\nThese small but meaningful changes to your existing meta and title tags can increase traffic to your site, making your 2024 content marketing strategy a success.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nAI tools don’t just create content—-they can help you with all aspects of your SEO, including click-through rates\nUse AI tools to gain a deeper understanding of your SEO insights and use what you’ve learned to optimize your content\nLook for more out-of-the-box use cases of AI for SEO and content marketing\nTrend #6: Getting Ready for Lights, Camera, AI Video Content\n\nTL;DR\n\nAI video tools can help personalize your content to your target audience—beyond generating basic AI videos.\n\nWith SEO becoming more complex, other forms of content, like short-form video and social media, will only continue to grow in popularity So, jumping on the video bandwagon and implementing AI video tools is the way to go.\n\nRoss Simmonds, CEO of Foundation, knows AI-video content is about to explode. \n\nSimmonds says, \n\nIn 2024, we are going to see the rise of AI-supported video content. A lot of people might read that and immediately think I’m talking about AI animations and AI-supported effects on the back of Midjourney. But in reality, I’m talking about top-to-bottom AI-created video experiences that include everything from talking head videos that are actually synthetic avatars using synthetic voice to AI-powered webinars.\n\nRoss Simmonds, CEO of Foundation\n\nAccording to our report, a growing number of businesses, 52%, plan to try AI-generated video content tools in 2024. \n\nWith the help of AI, video creators can:\n\nPersonalize a video message to an individual\nCreate an interactive video\nAuto-transcribe audio to make it accessible for all users\n\nSimmonds says, “In B2B, I think the rise of AI-driven content will have a huge impact on sales teams and executives who send mass communications to target customers.” \n\nAI tools like SubMagic, InVideo, Scena.ai, or Synthesia make it easy to start creating video content.\n\nFor example, here’s a useful guide on how to generate a video with AI:\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nShort-form videos will continue as a hot content marketing trend\nAI video tools help create personalized content tailored to your audience\nYou can use AI to create all kinds of video—from webinars and ads to onboarding, training and sales videos\nTrend #7: AI Can Help Attract Listeners to Your Podcast\n\nTL;DR\n\nUse AI tools to help you save time writing, producing, and marketing your podcast. This way, your podcast content can appear in search engines and gain new listeners.\n\nIf podcasting is part of your 2024 content strategy, you’ll want to pay attention to this content marketing trend: AI-supported podcasts.\n\nPodcasting is one of the world’s fastest-growing media. However, reaching new audiences and ranking your podcasts in search is not an easy task.\n\nHere’s how you can fix it.\n\nUsing AI technology, Google now indexes audio files, meaning your podcast episodes can rank in the search results with the proper optimization. \n\nIt’s important to note that Google doesn’t always get indexing right, especially regarding language processing.\n\nThings like your accent or the spelling of names might cause Google to index your show incorrectly.\n\nTo get it right, you can use AI podcast repurposing tools.\n\nThey automatically repurpose podcast episodes into transcripts, show notes, blogs and social media posts, newsletters, video clips, and more.\n\nJoão Amaro, Co-Founder of Podsqueeze, says:\n\nTranscribing podcast episodes can lead to a significant boost in online visibility, with studies\nshowing up to a 6.68% increase in search traffic and even a 50% rise in keyword rankings for some.\n\nJoão Amaro, Co-Founder of Podsqueeze\n\nAI audio tools can help podcast creators:\n\nTranscribe audio\nSummarize text and audio files for show notes and blog posts\nOptimize titles and meta descriptions for relevant keywords\nSuggest content ideas, talking points, or interview questions\nCreate royalty-free music\nEnhance sound quality\n\nFor example, the Hacker News Report, a podcast by Wondercraft.ai, delivers short summaries of top news stories and relies on AI tools to generate scripts. And it uses AI audio to provide the news, too.\n\nIf podcasting is on your radar for 2024, you’ll want to follow Amaro’s advice: use AI tools to save time creating and marketing your podcast.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nWith SEO becoming more challenging, podcasts can be an effective tool to reach additional audiences in 2024\nGoogle’s audio indexing can help your podcast rank in the search results\nUse AI tools to help speed up your podcasting tasks, like writing show notes and descriptions\nTrend 8: AI Will Further Promote Niche Content Marketing \n\nTL/DR:\n\nIn 2024, focus on quality over quantity in content marketing, with AI aiding niche content creation for a highly engaged audience.\n\nQuantity over quality is the wrong way to approach your 2024 content marketing strategy, especially if you’re a niche marketer.\n\nIt’s not about the number of blog posts on your website anymore—it’s about targeting relevant, hyper-targeted topics and creating comprehensive content to cover them.\n\nVanhishikha Bhargava, Founder of Contensify, is sure AI will be a huge factor in niche content marketing. \n\nBhargava says:\n\nFar from being just a tool for mass content production, AI is now steering towards enabling niche content creation. It simplifies researching and crafting content tailored for a very specific audience, ensuring every word resonates and adds value. The trending conversations around the E-E-A-T framework are confirming this shift. It's about prioritizing relevance and context over sheer content volume.\n\nVanhishikha Bhargava, Founder of Contensify\n\nIf you want your audience to stay on your website and for Google to play nice with the E-E-A-T framework, you’ll need to dig deep into your audience’s pain points to understand their needs.\n\nYou can use AI to:\n\nDefine your niche and better understand your target audience\nCreate an ideal reader persona based on your audience’s demographics\nStreamline the writing process\n\nFor example, you can ask AI whether your blog posts and landing pages are optimized for your buyer persona, or to create a content outline focusing on their pain points.\n\nAI tools like ContentShake AI can be instrumental in developing your niche content marketing strategy.
