And can keep visitors on your site longer, which may increase conversions.\n\nIn this guide, we'll show you some UX design examples in ecommerce, technology, and other industries. But first, make sure you understand what this practice entails.\n\nFor the most part, good UX design is about:\n\nUsability: Your website, app, or product should be easy to use and understand. On websites, customers should be able to access important pages in three clicks or less.\nFunctionality: Your product, service, or interface should fulfill its intended purpose. With little to no distracting elements.\nAttractiveness: Your site or mobile app should be visually appealing. So it can leave a lasting impression on users and keep your brand top of mind.\nSearchability: Visitors should be able to quickly find what they need on your site. That's why it's important to make your search bar prominent and add helpful features, like a magnifying glass icon and filtering options. \nAccessibility: Your website (or products) should be accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities. \nCredibility: In UX design, credibility refers to the degree to which a website, product, or service instills trust and confidence.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush's Site Audit to check your site's health. And detect UX issues like slow-loading pages, missing alt text, broken links, or too many on-page links. Site Audit will also show you how to fix these issues for better UX and SEO. \n\n14 Inspiring UX Design Examples\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at some of the best examples of UX design.\n\nWe'll also focus on websites with a great user interface (UI).\n\n1. Apple: Minimalist & Interactive Elements\n\nApple’s website features a minimalist design with interactive visual elements.\n\nIt works well because of the following design choices:\n\nThe website is easy to navigate with an intuitive navigation menu\nThe buttons are all functional\nAll the images are high-quality and eye-catching\nThe branding throughout the website is consistent\nThe website features a high-contrast color palette and readable fonts\n\nFor example, you can use the slider on the iPhone 15 product page to compare different phone colors. Or click a button to zoom in on the cameras.\n\nAnd you can clearly see the navigation menu (and its contents) on every page:\n\n2. Netflix: Intuitive UX & Personalized Suggestions\n\nNetflix allows you to browse thousands of movies and TV series without feeling overwhelmed. By giving you a personalized experience.\n\nHere are some notable UX design features:\n\nNetflix’s website has a clean interface that is easy to navigate\nThe Netflix algorithm presents personalized suggests, based on user behavior\nNetflix keeps things interesting by presenting new content first\nThe buttons are all useful and intuitive\n\nFor example, Netflix presents “New Releases” at the top of the homepage.\n\nAnd presents personalized suggestions under “Top Picks for [User].”\n\nNote\n\nNetflix and other brands conduct user testing, including A/B tests, to compare different versions of their UI features, streaming algorithms, and other elements. This practice allows them to keep up with customer demand and remain competitive.\n\n3. Zappos: Searchability & Personalization\n\nZappos is one of the best UX design examples in the ecommerce space.

Spotify: Custom Playlists for Music Aficionados \n\nSpotify is like Netflix for music. Users can browse thousands of songs and podcasts, create playlists, and search for content.\n\nIts website features high-color contrast, large buttons, clear labels, and other accessibility features\nIt also has a clear visual hierarchy, allowing users to switch between playlists, discover new songs, and take the desired action (e.g., embed playlists)\nThe bold typography and vibrant colors contribute to the brand’s visual storytelling\n\nThe platform offers custom recommendations based on the user’s location, preferences, and browsing history. These features enhance the user journey, allowing for highly personalized experiences.\n\nAnother cool feature is Spotify Wrapped, an annual campaign centered on the listening moments that defined the year. It leverages user data to display consumers' listening histories.\n\nThe familiar \"story\" format and users' ability to easily share their favorite music with friends drive engagement and brand awareness.\n\n5. Trello: Custom Workflows for Seamless Collaboration\n\nTrello enables users to personalize workflows.
