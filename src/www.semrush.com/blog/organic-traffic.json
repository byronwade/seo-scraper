  "content": "What Is Organic Traffic?\n\nOrganic traffic refers to visits that come to your site via unpaid (i.e., “organic”) search results. Meaning it’s search engine traffic you get for free—aside from what it costs to create and maintain the content.\n\nIncreasing organic traffic is one of the main search engine optimization (SEO) goals businesses have. Because it can result in more leads and sales.\n\nBenefits of Organic Website Traffic\n\nSome advantages of organic traffic include:\n\nAffordability: Organic traffic is free\nTargeted traffic: Organic traffic often attracts visitors who are specifically looking for the types of products/services and content you provide \nRelationship building: Organic traffic drives people to your content, and they may continue to engage with your brand if they like what they see\nLong-term sustainability: Organic traffic can provide a steady stream of visitors over time as long as your content remains relevant and optimized\nScalability: You can increase organic traffic with an SEO and content marketing strategy\n\nBut organic traffic also has potential downsides:\n\nOngoing investments: Although organic traffic is free, you still need to invest in SEO and content marketing to improve your search engine visibility\nSlow growth: Organic traffic growth takes time, requiring consistent effort before you’ll reliably see results\nAlgorithm dependency: Organic traffic is dependent on search engine algorithms, which can change frequently\nOrganic vs. Paid Traffic\n\nWhile organic traffic visits come from appearing in standard search results, paid traffic visits come from pay-per-click (PPC) ads on results pages.\n\nPaid search campaigns can deliver almost immediate results and allow you to target users based on specific criteria. Such as demographics, location, and search behavior.\n\nBut these campaigns can be costly—especially in competitive markets. And the traffic stops as soon as you stop paying for ads.\n\nIn contrast, organic traffic has the potential to generate a large volume of clicks to your site without incurring any costs beyond your initial investments.\n\nYou can estimate the total value of any website’s organic traffic in Semrush’s Organic Research tool. \n\nJust enter a domain and look for “Traffic Cost”:\n\nHere, we see that it would cost roughly $23.2 million in running paid search ads to replicate eBay’s August 2024 organic traffic for the same keywords\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ SEO Results\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Increase Organic Traffic\n\nNow, let’s look at how to drive organic traffic to a website. Which requires a coherent SEO strategy, using SEO best practices, and following these five steps:\n\nStep 1: Fix Any Technical Issues Your Site Has\n\nGoogle needs to be able to discover, crawl, and index (store in a database) your website’s content for you to rank for relevant queries and attract traffic. So, you’ll want to ensure there are no technical issues getting in the way. \n\nSemrush’s Site Audit tool makes it easy to check your site for technical issues that could affect its crawlability and indexability.\n\nFirst, enter your domain into the text box and click “Start Audit.”\n\nFollow the prompts to configure your audit. \n\nOnce you’ve done that, click the “Start Site Audit” button.\n\nWhen the audit is complete, you can see your site’s overall health with the “Site Health” score. The higher the score, the fewer technical issues your site has.\n\nHead to the “Issues” tab to see a complete list of all the problems the tool detected. \n\nThese are categorized into “Errors,” “Warnings,” and “Notices.” \n\nYou should address errors first—they’re the most severe issues affecting your site. \n\nIn this example, the tool found broken images, redirect chains and loops, a broken internal link, and a duplicate meta description.\n\nClick “Why and how to fix it” next to any issue to learn more about it and how to address it.\n\nTake whatever steps you need to resolve the first error. Then, work through the rest of the errors, warnings, and notices.\n\nFurther reading: How to Perform a Technical SEO Audit in 10 Steps\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nStep 2: Find Keywords to Drive Your SEO Strategy\n\nKeyword research helps you identify valuable queries people use when searching for information related to your niche. Which you can use to create targeted content that attracts more organic traffic to your site. \n\nStart finding relevant search terms with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a seed keyword (a broad term related to your niche) into the text box and your domain in the “AI-powered feature” box. Then click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will then produce a list of relevant keyword suggestions. \n\nIt also provides important metrics for each keyword, including:\n\nSearch intent (Intent): What users are hoping to achieve when they perform a search for that term\nSearch volume (Volume): The average number of monthly searches for the keyword\nPersonal Keyword Difficulty (PKD %): The estimated ranking difficulty for that keyword on a scale of 0 to 100 for your specific domain. The lower the score, the more likely you are to rank well. \n\nYour goal is to find terms with the right combination of high search volume and low Personal Keyword Difficulty. And then target those terms with the right type of content to satisfy the searcher’s intent. (More on that in the next step.)\n\nYou’ll find keyword groups (topically related terms) in the left-hand menu. Which can be useful for exploring more specific keyword topics within your niche.\n\nOnce you find relevant terms you want to target, select the box to the right of those keywords and click “+ Add to keyword list.” \n\nThen, give your list a name and click the green check.\n\nRepeat this process with other keyword groups to find even more terms\n\nThen, see which terms your competitors target. To find even more relevant keywords.\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool for this.\n\nEnter your domain and at least one competitor’s domain. Then click “Compare.”\n\nThe tool will then compare the keyword profiles of each domain.\n\nThe two keyword categories you should focus on first are:\n\nMissing: These are keywords your competitors rank for but you don’t\nWeak: These are keywords your competitors rank for higher than you\n\nThere’s a good chance you’ll find some great keyword opportunities here. After all, if your closest competitors are ranking for certain keywords, they’re probably relevant to your website as well.\n\nFurther reading: Keyword Research for SEO: What It Is & How to Do It\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nStep 3: Create Search Intent-Focused Content\n\nHigh-quality SEO content that satisfies users’ needs is more likely to rank highly in search results. And drive organic traffic to your site.\n\nIt also helps you establish authority in your niche and build trust with your audience.\n\nFirst, look at your keyword list and determine which terms you already have content focused on. So you can optimize those pieces to attract more traffic.\n\nYou can easily find optimization opportunities for your site’s content using Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker.\n\nEnter your domain into the text box and click “Get ideas.”\n\nWhen you get to the “Add pages to optimize” screen during setup, choose the “Manually” tab. So you can specify the pages you want to optimize based on your keyword research.\n\nThe tool will then give an overview of potential improvement areas and list the specific pages you should prioritize.\n\nClick “# ideas” next to any of the listed pages to view suggestions for that page.\n\nFor example, here we see that the selected page is difficult to read and doesn’t have a relevant meta description.\n\nFixing these issues could improve the page’s relevance for the target keyword in Google’s eyes.\n\nFor keywords you need to create new content around, use Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant. Which checks the piece for SEO, tone of voice, readability, and originality in real time.\n\nReview Your Drafts in Real Time\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign Up Now →\nStep 4: Acquire Quality Backlinks\n\nEarning backlinks (links from other domains that point to yours) from other reputable websites increases your site’s authority and credibility. Which can lead to better rankings and more organic traffic.\n\nThe key to building quality backlinks is to consistently publish high-value content that other sites naturally want to link to.\n\nBut you can speed up the process with dedicated link building tactics.\n\nSome examples include:\n\nBroken link building: When you find a site with a broken external link and suggest replacing it with a link to a relevant resource on your own site\nThe skyscraper technique: When you take a popular piece of content and create your own version of it that’s better than what the competition has\nChecking competitor backlinks: When you check which sites link to your competitors and ask if they can also link to your site\n\nSpeed things up by finding new link building opportunities for your site with Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nEnter your domain and click “Start Link Building.”\n\nThe tool will then generate a list of prospects (sites that might link to you) based on your domain’s keywords and competitors.\n\nYou can find these in the “Prospects” tab.\n\nThen, choose which prospects to contact. (This is easiest when you have a relevant piece of content to share.)\n\nAnd manage the entire outreach process within the Link Building Tool.\n\nFurther reading: Link Building for SEO: A Guide to the Basics\n\nSecure Valuable Backlinks\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nStep 5: Set Up Your Google Business Profile (If Applicable)\n\nIf you run a brick-and-mortar business or a local service business, focusing on local SEO can significantly boost your organic traffic.\n\nIn the U.S., 32% of people search online for local businesses several times a week.
