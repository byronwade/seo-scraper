  "content": "Google Business Profile, otherwise known as GBP (and formerly known as Google My Business), is a valuable marketing tool that’s often underused.\n\nBut taking advantage of this free listing can help you boost brand awareness on the world’s most popular search engine and gain more customers.\n\nHere’s how to make the most of your GBP:\n\n1. Write an Engaging, Keyword-Friendly Business Description\n\nBesides your business name, your GBP description is the first thing users see when your business pops up on Google search.\n\nSo, you need it to be accurate, compelling, and relevant to your target audience.\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nBe Concise and Showcase What Makes Your Brand Unique\n\nProvide clear information about what you do. But sprinkle in some personality by highlighting your brand’s story, mission, and core values. \n\nLet’s look at this example from fashion boutique Aritzia: \n\nFrom the GBP description, we immediately learn Aritzia’s target audience: women. We learn what they offer: clothes. We learn that their core goal is to provide high-quality, contemporary fashion at a valuable price. And we get this key info in the first three sentences. \n\nThen, they highlight their true “secret sauce”: developing their own brands, searching for top sources across the globe, and paying close attention to details.\n\nIt’s short, engaging, and informative. \n\nFollow Aritzia’s lead with your own quick blurb that focuses on what you do and what makes your brand stand out.\n\nNote\n\nGBP descriptions have a 750-character limit. \n\nTo write your “Description,” log into your GBP account. \n\nClick on “Edit profile.” \n\nA box will open with all your “Business information” options. Click the pencil icon next to “Description.”\n\nThen, enter your text into the Description box.\n\nNot sure where to begin? Our AI Writing Assistant can help.\n\nWrite Your GBP Description\n\nwith AI Writing Assistant\n\nTry It Free →\nInclude Strategic Keywords\n\nBesides writing a description that potential customers respond well to, you also need search engines to respond well to it.\n\nThis is where SEO keywords come in. Including relevant, frequently searched terms connected to your business and industry can help you rank higher on search engines. Which makes it easier for customers to find you. \n\nSay you’re a local pet store. It would make sense to include location-specific keywords in your profile to target pet owners in your area.\n\nBut you don’t want to just throw in phrases like “pet stores Wisconsin” over and over again. This kind of keyword stuffing is obvious to readers and search engines and takes away value from your profile. \n\nKeywords should naturally fit into your writing.\n\nLike this:\n\nTo find the right phrases to boost your profile visibility, start with keyword research. This just means finding and evaluating strategic keywords for your specific company to target.\n\nIt might seem intimidating if you’ve never done it before, but don’t worry. Our Keyword Magic Tool can help you find the right phrases to include to boost your profile visibility.\n\nTo start, you need a broad phrase or term related to your brand’s niche or industry. This is known as a seed keyword. Seed keywords serve as the starting point from which you’ll find more specific keywords.\n\nFor example, “pet stores.”\n\nNote\n\nSeed keywords aren’t the same as primary keywords. Seed keywords are much more generic, as they serve as the root point of your search. Primary keywords come from seed keywords. They’re the main ones you actually use in your SEO strategy.\n\nType in your seed keyword word and click the “Search” button.\n\nThen, click through the following tabs:\n\nBroad Match\nExact Match\nRelated \n\nThe “Broad Match” tab will show you variations of your seed keyword. \n\nThe “Exact Match” tab shows phrases that include your exact seed keyword.\n\nAnd the “Related Match” tab shows you search terms that are similar to your seed keyword.\n\nAs you come across potential keywords to add to your profile description, save them using the checkbox to the right of any keyword result. Then, hit the “+ Add to keyword list” button. \n\nYou can add to an existing list or click the “Create new empty list” text box to create a new one. Click the checkmark to the right to save your selections.\n\nFurther reading: How to Do Keyword Research for SEO (A Detailed 3-Step Guide)\n\n2. Set Up Direct Messaging\n\nSet up direct messaging to answer questions, get feedback, and engage with potential customers. \n\nImage Source: MARA\n\nThis GBP feature allows searchers to contact you directly. So, you can quickly provide information and respond to questions that can boost sales and encourage more business.\n\nResponding to each customer’s concern personally shows that you value them. This helps build trust and satisfaction. And happy customers are likely to recommend your business to others.\n\nTo set it up, open the “Messages” section on your GBP dashboard.\n\nNote\n\nIf you haven’t done so yet, Google will ask you to verify your business before you can set up direct messaging. Click the blue “Get verified” button. Enter your business address and click “Next.” If accepted, you’ll see “You're now verified.” Click “Next.” You may also need to confirm your business hours. Once that’s done, click “Next.” Then, you’ll see “Add messaging.”\n\nClick the “Turn on” button and add your contact info so customers can use it to reach out to you.\n\nThen, you’ll receive a verification code from Google to confirm your identity. Enter that code, and you’re all set.\n\nHow to Automate Basic Replies\n\nEven if you can’t get to a customer inquiry right away, people want to know their message has been received. According to a 2022 survey, 70% of American consumers expect a same-day response after contacting a company. \n\nAutomated replies give customers a reasonable expectation of when they can expect to hear from you so they don’t think you’re ignoring them.\n\nGBP has an automated, customizable “away message” feature you can use to initially reply to users.\n\nGo to “Messages” > “Chat settings” > “Away mode” to set yours up.\n\nMake sure to keep your away messages up-to-date—especially if you add any details like: \n\nAway for the holidays\nOn vacation until …\nWe’re moving to a new location!\n\nFurther Reading: What is Omnichannel?

Add Compelling Photos That Represent Your Brand\n\nWhether you’re adding to your GBP photo album or uploading a post or product, you want high-quality pictures that show off the best of your brand.\n\nImage Source: Sassy Cow Creamery\n\nThese visuals are key to hooking in new customers and driving engagement.\nHere are some best practices:\n\nEnsure your pictures adhere to Google’s photo guidelines: Following Google’s standards for file sizes and formatting makes sure they’re clear and upload correctly\nPost different types of photos: From exterior shots to staff and customer interactions, strive to show a 360-view of your business\nAdd new photos to share updates: Keep things fresh and keep shoppers in the loop on your latest products, specials, and events\nShowcase your business’ unique features: Share pictures of the things your customers will want to take pictures of, whether it’s a unique dish or a vivid mural\n\nPro tip\n\nBesides your own pictures, share relevant user-generated content (UGC) from customers using your products or services. These photos tell an authentic story about your company and encourage others to take their own pictures in the hopes of getting featured on your page.\n\nTo upload a picture, go to your GBP dashboard and click the “Add photo” icon. \n\nChoose “Photo.”\n\nClick “Select photos or videos” or drag your files into the box.\n\nYou can click “See photos” to view your photo right away or hit “Add more photos.”\n\nAfter you click “See photos,” a new screen will appear that says one of three things: \n\nPending: The photo is processing and not yet public on Google\nNot approved: The photo was flagged for not meeting Google guidelines (e.g., size is too small or too large, unaccepted file format, you haven’t verified your business profile, etc.) \nLive: The photo is posted on your profile \n\nIf your photo is flagged, click “Learn more” and you’ll be redirected to the photo guidelines.\n\nFurther reading: Visual Search Guide: What It Is, Benefits, and Optimization Tips\n\n3. Regularly Post to Your Google Business Profile\n\nThink of your GBP as an extension of your existing social media marketing strategy. Taking the time to regularly update your GBP helps you enhance brand visibility and customer engagement.\n\nPosting frequently shows that your business is active and gives searchers an idea of what your brand is all about. And you can use your posts to encourage users to move down the marketing funnel.\n\nGBP offer three different kinds of posts:\n\nUpdate: Use this for regular posts. \nOffer: Use this for specials and promos.\nEvent: Use this to promote any kind of special event. \nHow to Create and Publish a Google Post\n\nSign into your GBP account. \n\nClick the “Add update” button on your dashboard. You might have to click on the drop-down arrow if you don’t initially see it as an option.\n\nChoose “Add update,” “Add offer,” or “Add event.” For this example, we’ll use “Add update.” \n\nNow, type in your update. Then, add up to 10 photos.\n\nNext, you’ll see options for a call to action (CTA). While this isn’t a mandatory field, we highly recommend using it. This clickable button makes it easy for users to take a certain action, like buying a product, signing up for a newsletter, or visiting a webpage.\n\nJust pop in your desired URL and choose one of the pre-set CTA titles:\n\nBook\nOrder online\nLearn more\nSign up\nCall now\n\nBefore making your post public, click on “Preview” to double check that everything is how you want it. Use the back arrow in the top left corner if you need to make any edits. \n\nOnce you’re satisfied, click the “Post” button at the bottom right corner of the page. \n\nOnce published, the post will appear at the bottom of your live profile. \n\nSchedule Posts\n\nwith the Social Poster Tool\n\nSign up Now →\n4. Make the Most of Product and Service Uploads\n\nAccording to Mintel, around half of surveyed consumers in the United States have bought products through social media platforms. And adding your products and services to your GBP profile is no different than doing so on a platform like Instagram or Pinterest.\n\nThis makes it even easier for searchers to browse and buy from you. And searchers can quickly find what they’re looking for using sidebar filters.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse the “Collections” button to organize all your products in easy-to-navigate categories. Google recommends that you aim for at least three products in each collection.\n\nTo add a product to your profile, sign into your GBP account and click on the “Edit products” icon. \n\nA new window will appear. Click the “Get started” button. Now, it’s time to optimize your product upload.\n\nCreate Detailed Descriptions\n\nLike your business description, your product descriptions can make or break customer interest. \n\nSo, you need your them to be concise, thoughtful, and keyword friendly.\n\nStart by adding the product name, price, and webpage URL in the relevant fields. \n\nThen, highlight the core features of your product or service that’ll resonate with your target audience.\n\nLet’s say we were selling candles. Some notable elements to hone in on could include:\n\nThe basics: A rose-gold, vanilla-scented candle with a four-hour burn time, perfect for intimate dinners or a relaxing bath\nProduct components: Blend of natural soy wax and high-grade vanilla essence for a clean, authentic fragrance \nStand-out features:\nMade locally by company founder, Julia, and her sister, Maria, ensuring each candle has a personal touch\nPackaged in eco-friendly materials to reduce environmental footprint\n\nDon’t forget to integrate relevant keywords into these descriptions (e.g., “vanilla candle,” “eco-friendly candle”). Use them naturally in your writing so you can boost your SEO without sacrificing readability.\n\nCrafting engaging, SEO-friendly descriptions from scratch for each of your products can take a lot of time and brain power. Save yours with our AI Writing Assistant.\n\nClick on “All Tools” from the left-hand menu.\n\nType “Product Descriptions” in the search bar. Hit your Enter key. \n\nYou’ll then see three product description tools:\n\nProduct Descriptions\nEcommerce Product Descriptions\nAmazon Product Descriptions\n\nFor GBP, we recommend using one of the first two options. \n\nThen, you’ll see a form where you can provide specific details about your product.\n\nSelect the language for your product description\nSet the creativity level to match your marketing style—”High” for more elaborate descriptions or “Regular” for straightforward details\nInput your product name\nDefine your target audience with specifics about their age, interests, professions, etc.\nProvide a summary of your product, highlighting key features or selling points you want emphasized.\n\nUse the plus and minus signs to select how many description variations you want the AI to create (you can choose up to eight). Then, click “Generate.”\n\nWithin 30 seconds, you’ll get draft product descriptions. Hover over each one to:\n\nCheck for plagiarism: Confirm the originality of the description\nCopy: To paste and edit it in your GBP\nSave: Add the description to the “Saved” tab for later use\n\nIf the results miss the mark, you can manually edit the copy or go back to the form and adjust the settings.\n\nChoose the Most Relevant Product Categories\n\nThink of your product categories like keywords. The right categories can get you in front of people who’re the most likely to use your products or services. \n\nIn this example, you can see how Luminosa Light Designs Inc. uses the “Lighting” and “Decor” categories to quickly guide searchers to the products they’re most interested in.\n\nTo choose yours, click the “Select a category” drop-down and hit “Create a new category.”\n\nNote\n\nIf you’ve entered a product category in the past, it’ll appear in the drop-down menu when you click “Select a category.”\n\nType in a relevant product category under 58 characters. \n\nOnce all your fields are filled out and you’ve uploaded a photo, click “Publish.” \n\nIf you have any errors (like a dollar sign symbol in the product price), you’ll be asked to edit them. If not, you’ll see a screen that says “Your product is being added.” \n\nIf you have more products to add, click the “Add next product” button and repeat the same process. \n\nFurther reading: The Future of Ecommerce is Now: Industry Insights for 2023 & Beyond\n\n5. Respond to Customer Reviews\n\nManaging and responding to customer reviews—both positive and negative—shows you value customer feedback. In fact, a Google study found that businesses that respond to reviews are considered nearly two times more trustworthy than those that don't.\n\nYour responses also contribute to establishing your brand’s trustworthiness with search engines. This is a key factor in how Google evaluates and ranks content.\n\nAllocate time to:\n\nThank your customers for positive reviews\nAddress concerns mentioned in negative or bad reviews with professionalism\nActively communicate any misconceptions and offer solutions if required\n\nPro tip\n\nUse the “Ask for Reviews” button on your GBP dashboard to get a shareable link to encourage more users to review of your business. \n\nHere’s an example of the owner of a small, local bakery responding to a negative review: \n\nAnd the same business owner responding to a positive review: \n\nWhile it’s important to acknowledge reviews, it can be time consuming. \n\nOur Review Management tool can help. Use the software to respond to reviews on more than 70 different registered directories, such as Google, Bing, Facebook, Instagram, Yelp.\n\nOur dashboard shows you key data points, like:\n\nTotal reviews\nAverage star rating\nWeekly and monthly review progress \nYour review response rate\n\nFurther reading: A Beginner’s Guide to Online Reputation Management\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nHow Often Should I Update My Google Business Profile?\n\nThere isn’t a specific “right” number when it comes to posting. But we recommend publishing at least once a week to show searchers you’re active. And make updates as needed on key info like your business hours, new products, events, etc.\n\nIncorporating fresh content also sends activity signals to Google. These signals indicate that your business is engaged and interactive, which boosts your credibility in the eyes of the search engine.\n\nDoes Running Google Ads Help My Google Business Profile?\n\nIt can!\n\nWhile you can’t place ads directly on your GBP, Google Ads can still help increase your brand visibility and traffic. So, your profile will also benefit.\n\nAnd if you’re a local business, your local SEO will get a boost through targeting specific areas. Which helps you reach more relevant potential customers.\n\nWhat's the Most Efficient Way to Update My GBP?\n\nThe quickest way to update and maintain your Google Business Profile is by using a central management tool. \n\nInstead of juggling updates, posts, and reviews manually—which can be overwhelming, especially for small teams or busy business owners—a tool like our Listing Management centralizes all these tasks.\n\nSkip the duplicate efforts. Keep a close eye on your GBP and all your other business listings in one spot.\n\nIncrease Your Visibility\n\nwith the Listing Management Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
