  "content": "What Is Average Time on Page in Google Analytics?\n\nAverage time on page was a Google Analytics metric that helped determine how long users engaged with your website content. It measured the average amount of time your users spent on any given page on your site.\n\nThis was in Universal Analytics (UA), and the metric no longer exists in that form in Google Analytics 4 (GA4). The closest representation is now Average Engagement Time.\n\nAverage Time on Page vs. Average Engagement Time in Google Analytics\n\nIn the past, Google Analytics only recorded the time between a user landing on one page and navigating to another on your site. It relied on the time of the next page view to determine how long the visitor spent on a given page.\n\nThis meant the tool couldn’t record the time a user spent on the last page of their visit. As there was no “next” page view (on your site) to get the time from. \n\nBut in GA4, average engagement time captures a user's total time engaging with a page, including instances where the page may be the last one in their session. \n\nThis gives a more accurate picture of user engagement, as it also accounts for those visitors who may only visit a single page on your site.\n\nAlthough the metrics have different names, the core idea remains the same: measuring how long visitors interact with your content.\n\nHow to See Time on Page in Google Analytics 4\n\nThere are a few different ways to find your average time on page in GA4.\n\nHow to Find Your Website’s Average Engagement Time\n\nTo view your website’s overall average engagement time in Google Analytics 4, click “Reports” in the left-hand navigation bar.\n\nThen click “Life cycle” > “Engagement” > “Overview.” This will show you the average engagement time across your entire website.\n\nHow to Find Your Website’s Average Engagement Time per Session\n\nTo see your average engagement time per session, click “Average engagement time per session.”\n\nThis number will be slightly different from the average engagement time, as your website’s number of sessions will likely differ from your number of users.\n\nHow to Find Average Engagement Time by Page\n\nYou can see a breakdown of your average engagement time by page by going to the “Average engagement time” column under “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Engagement” > “Pages and screens.”\n\nYou can sort by average engagement time, ordering them from lowest to highest, to find pages that have a low average engagement time. You may want to update these pages to improve engagement. \n\nYou can find the average engagement time for a specific page or group of pages by using the search bar above “Page path and screen class.”\n\nWhy Is Time on Page an Important Metric?\n\nTime on page is an important metric to track because it indicates how engaging your content is for your readers.\n\nGoogle Analytics metrics like users and page views are a good indication of your website’s traffic. But they don’t offer a deeper understanding of how well your content is serving your users’ needs.\n\nIf your blog is reaching thousands of readers every month, it might appear to be successful. However, if most people coming to your site are leaving within a few seconds of landing on the page, your content likely isn’t resonating with your readers.\n\nAverage engagement time is a helpful metric to monitor your SEO results because it can help you determine whether visitors are genuinely engaging with your content.\n\nWhat Is a Good Average Time on Page?\n\nA good average time on page varies based on factors like your industry, the type of content you have on your website, and user behavior patterns.\n\nFor example, an in-depth article on a complex topic should have a longer average time on page compared to a glossary page that defines a term in one paragraph. A reader might spend 15 minutes on the longer article, and just one minute on the glossary page.\n\nBut both of these might be serving the user with exactly what they need. So you need to take into account various factors when assessing your site’s average time on page.\n\nLong vs. Short Average Time on Page\n\nA short average time on page can indicate a misalignment between what your users expect and what they find on the page—or it could be a sign of effective, concise content. If a reader gets what they need quickly, you’ve probably served them well.\n\nA longer time on page generally suggests deeper engagement. But if a reader is spending a long time reading your content and not taking specific actions (like signing up for an email list or buying a product), then it may not be aligned with your business’s goals.\n\nYou need to analyze your website, industry, and the type of content you produce to understand what a “good” average time on page looks like. \n\nHow to Increase Your Average Time on Page\n\nIf you find that your website’s average time on page is much lower than it should be, there are some simple ways to increase it.\n\n1. Produce High-Quality Content\n\nHigh-quality content that resonates with your readers and aligns with what they are looking for can keep them engaged for longer.\n\nUnderstanding your audience’s search intent (why they enter a specific search query) will help you create relevant content that provides them with what they need.\n\nYou can ask yourself: \n\nWhat are the questions and problems your audience has related to your products, services, or field of expertise?\n\nYou can use the Topic Research tool to find relevant topics that your audience cares about. Along with related questions you may want to answer within your content.\n\nEnter a topic, select a location, and hit the “Get content ideas” button.\n\nThe tool will generate cards of relevant subtopics and ideas to include in your content.\n\nClick on a card to view more details like top-shared headlines, questions and related searches on that topic. You’ll also see metrics like search volume, keyword difficulty, and topic efficiency. \n\nPick the most relevant topics and questions to include in your content as subheadings. This ensures you cover the most important information for your readers, and it can help keep them engaged for longer.

Ideal for presenting tips, steps, or recommendations in a structured way.\nHow-to guides: Effective for detailed, instructional content. Suitable for audiences seeking comprehensive, step-by-step information on specific tasks or processes.\nShort-form articles: Great for concise overviews or updates. Best for audiences looking for quick insights or summaries without deep dives into the subject matter.\nLong-form articles: Ideal for thorough exploration of complex topics.

It depends on what helps you communicate the topic in the most relevant and helpful way to your target audience.\n\nFind out the best content format for your readers by looking at the types of content that rank high on search engine results pages (SERPs) for your target keywords. And by reviewing which content formats your competitors are using successfully.\n\n3. Make Your Content Easy to Read\n\nMaking your content easy to read allows your audience to focus on the value you’re providing.

Your website should be easy and intuitive to navigate, and overall it should provide an enjoyable experience.\n\nIf it’s hard to find key pages on your website, difficult to read your content due to lots of ads on the page, or if your pages take a long time to load, your users are unlikely to stick around for long.\n\nFaster loading webpages don’t just provide a better user experience. They can also contribute to higher search engine rankings. As page speed is a confirmed Google ranking factor.\n\nBut even if people find your content, a slow-loading website can also significantly increase the likelihood of a visitor leaving your site without interacting with it (known as a bounce). \n\nGoogle has found that the probability of a bounce increases almost threefold when site load times increase from 1-3 seconds to 1-5 seconds.\n\nFollow these best practices to optimize your webpages’ load times:\n\nCompress your images: Large file sizes can slow down your website and take a while to load for the user—which could cause them to bounce\nLeverage minification: Remove unnecessary characters, whitespace, and other unnecessary elements from your code (if you use WordPress, there are plugins that can do this for you)\nEnable browser caching: This can allow repeat visitors to load your site faster, as their browser can store some of your site’s data\nUse a Content Delivery Network (CDN): CDNs can distribute your content across multiple servers worldwide, reducing the distance between the server and the user for faster load times\n5. Build a Solid Internal Linking Strategy\n\nCreating a network of internal links between your pages helps you guide visitors to other relevant content on your website. This can improve the overall average engagement time on your website, as users explore more pages and remain engaged for longer.\n\nInternal links are hyperlinks that direct visitors to different pages on your website (like the one at the start of this sentence).\n\nFor example, if you have an article about basic SEO techniques, linking to a post on advanced SEO tactics might encourage them to explore more of your site. While also allowing them to build on what they’ve just learned in the first article.\n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to understand your website’s current internal linking structure. And see where you can make improvements.\n\nEnter your domain name and hit the “Start Audit” button.
