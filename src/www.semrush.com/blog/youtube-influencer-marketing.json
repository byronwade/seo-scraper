  "content": "If you’ve been thinking of leveraging YouTube creators to achieve next-level brand awareness, you’re in good company.\n\nAfter Instagram, YouTube is the second most popular platform for influencer marketing. Compared to traditional celebrity partnerships, collaborations with social media content creators have been 4x more effective.\n\nAnd according to Google, they have equal influence in guiding purchase decisions.\n\nFrom research to outreach, negotiation to execution, this guide walks you through the steps of launching a winning YouTube influencer marketing campaign.\n\nBefore we dive into the guide, let’s go over the fundamentals of influencer marketing.\n\nWhy YouTube for Influencer Marketing?\n\nWhen it comes down to it, size matters.\n\nThere are an astounding 2B active users on YouTube, making it a leading platform for marketers to reach (massive) new audiences.\n\nTo boot, more than 40% of all global internet users consume its content each month.\n\nAs the world’s second most used social media platform, YouTube lends itself well to companies and brands looking to key into influencer marketing. \n\nLet’s see a few examples for inspiration.\n\nExamples of YouTube Influencer Marketing Campaigns\n\nWhether your goal is to build brand awareness or increase conversions, there are several campaign types that could stick with your target audience.\n\nUnboxing Videos\n\nSimple, and effective. \n\nThey focus on the influencer giving their first (and authentic) impression when opening and experiencing a product for the first time.\n\nUnboxing videos are very popular because they have a simple format that can apply to a number of industries, like clothing, cosmetics, and even household products.\n\nSee this example below from Unbox Therapy, a popular tech review YouTube channel.\n\nProduct Reviews\n\nAnother approach involves inviting influencers to review your products in a video format. \n\nThis strategy introduces your business through the lens of a trusted influencer, bolstered by their positive endorsement of your product.\n\nIn the example below, this YouTuber gives his honest advice on popular men’s fragrances.\n\nHauls\n\nSimilar to product reviews, hauls can combine multiple brands which the influencer presents as a selection of their top picks. \n\nSee this example below from a popular YouTuber who combines unboxings and giveaways in this campaign.\n\nContests\n\nFrom beauty products to clothing, gadgets, free memberships and beyond—many brands have succeeded through giveaways and contests with YouTube creators.\n\nIt’s hard to think of anyone other than MrBeast’s challenges; here’s an example that’s racked up more than 16M views to date.\n\nTutorials\n\nEver considered collaborating with an influencer on a product tutorial or explainer? These yield excellent results for industries like software or tools that require more detailed knowledge of a specific topic.\n\nYou can leverage them effectively for nearly any “how to” problem your product or service solves.\n\nSee this case below with Nathan Gotch, an expert SEO who teaches you how to do keyword research.\n\nDay-in-the-Life or Get Ready With Me Videos\n\nThe “Day-in-the-Life” vlog-style format gives an intimate glimpse into an influencer's daily routine. \n\nOften showcasing a mix of personal activities, such as morning rituals, meals, workouts, and interactions with friends or family, it gives viewers a way to connect with the influencer on a more personal level. \n\nIn the \"Get Ready With Me\" variant, the influencer takes the audience through their makeup and grooming routine, sharing tips and product recommendations along the way.\n\nThese video styles also work well as YouTube Shorts, a reel-type format that (like the name implies) delivers a short, catchy, digestible video.\n\nHere’s an example from a popular content creator in Canada inviting his audience to join him for a run.\n\nNow that you have some ideas of what your YouTube influencer marketing strategy could look like, let’s dive into the steps to make it a reality.\n\nStep One: Find the Best YouTubers for Your Influencer Campaign\n\nThere’s no single recipe for a successful influencer campaign on YouTube, but there are several key ingredients.\n\nTo hit the mark, you’ll need to find creators with:\n\nThe right audience size and reach\nA voice that aligns with your brand \nA price tag that fits your budget\n\nYou can accomplish all of it by researching creators in your niche, evaluating their audience, content style, engagement, and past brand collaborations.\n\nHow to Research Popular YouTubers in Your Niche\n\nAs a search engine, YouTube makes it easy to quickly find the top-viewed and highest-rated videos. All you need to do is enter your keywords and explore the search results.\n\nBut if you want to go deeper into keyword research trends, top videos, and see what users are searching for, try the Keyword Analytics for YouTube app in the Semrush App Center. \n\nTailored for marketers launching YouTube creator campaigns, this tool streamlines keyword research, highlights emerging trends, and connects you with brand-aligned content creators.\n\nEnter your niche-specific keywords and discover the competitive score, search volume, and top popular videos in a few clicks.\n\nNext, explore the creator’s channels that appear in the Top popular video results in the app. This’ll give you insights into their audience size and engagement, so you can evaluate their content even further.\n\nTo personalize the creator search more specifically to your brand and budget, try the Influencer Analytics app. It’s a powerful influencer discovery hub that helps you plan and manage your budgets for your paid campaigns.\n\nIt comes with two helpful tools for finding influencers: by filters or keywords. \n\nThe first tool lets you search for creators using filters such as where they're from, how many subscribers they have, and 30+ other data breakdowns. \n\nThe second tool looks for influencers who've talked about certain topics—just type in your keywords and see who's mentioned them. \n\nThese tools make searching faster, aid in budget estimation, and let you share lists of influencers with your team for campaign planning.\n\nHow to Find a YouTube Creator with Influencer Analytics\n\nLet’s imagine you’re marketing a technology brand, and you want to find a YouTube creator who aligns with your launch campaign by reviewing your products. \n\nYou have $1.5K to spend and want to target as many people in the United States as possible.\n\nUse the filters to select your channel industry (science and technology), campaign location, budget, language, and subscriber size. \n\nThe app will provide you with a list of YouTube creators that fit your criteria, including links to their latest videos.\n\nNow that you have a solid list of influencers, you’ll start the next steps in determining whether they’re a good fit for your brand. \n\nAnalyze Channel Quality and Engagement\n\nIn Influencer Analytics, select the influencer’s profile to check the subscriber count, views, and average video engagement rate in their profile.\n\nYou’ll find a channel quality score in the Overview tab. From 1-100, it measures the activity and level of engagement rate—100 being the highest rating.\n\nYou’ll also see stats on:\n\nThe average number of views per post\nThe average number of likes per post\nLinks to their other social profiles (if applicable)\n\nNext, head to the Video tab and spend some time watching their content.\n\nThink critically when reviewing their videos by asking yourself the following questions:\n\nDoes this influencer’s content directly relate to my brand or product?\nWhy would their audience care about my brand or product? \nDoes this content creator’s values and style align with mine?\nWhy and how would this influencer benefit from collaborating with my brand?\nWould my target audience trust and find value in this person’s approach?\n\nThere’s no definitive way to find the best influencer for your campaign. \n\nContent creators are forging a new path in marketing, and they are as unique as the brands they partner with.\n\nThat’s why it’s crucial to review their previous collaborative efforts to help you determine whether they’re a good fit.\n\nEvaluate their Previous Brand Collaborations\n\nHead to the Sponsored video tab in Influencer Analytics next. This’ll let you see how they’ve promoted other brands in sponsored campaigns historically. \n\nHere you’ll be able to assess the authenticity and effectiveness of their previous partnerships. Be sure to check for positive (and negative) feedback, comments, and results from other brands.\n\nOn each video, you’ll also see the cost breakdown. This is helpful for managing your expectations about the quality of the production and the effort the creator took in producing the video.\n\nOnce you’ve selected a list of influencers you want to work with, it’s time to start the outreach process.\n\nStep Two: Build Relationships with YouTube Creators\n\nRemember: influencer marketing is a two-way street. It’s a collaboration that leverages someone’s credibility and authenticity to endorse a brand.\n\nWith that said, consider their motivations and goals. \n\nBoth monetary and non-monetary—how does working with you benefit them?\n\nHaving solid answers to these questions will set you up for success when you’re ready to start communicating with them.\n\nLet’s start with the outreach process, and how to stand out in their inbox of requests.\n\nTips for Reaching out to YouTube Content Creators\n\nYou’ll need to craft a personalized and compelling email or direct message. Explain why you chose them and how your brand aligns with their content.\n\nIf your content creator has say, 10M engaged followers, it’s likely that they get a LOT of solicitations. So keep this in mind when making your first impression.\n\nAvoid being too forceful, overly enthusiastic, or diving into money matters upfront.\n\nInstead, take a professional and sincere approach, keeping your message concise. Don't be discouraged if you don't get an immediate response—about half of all influencer outreach messages are opened, and only 20% get replies.\n\nInfluencers are motivated by more than just money. They want the brands they work with to align with their values and messaging. \n\nCreating meaningful content that resonates with their followers is also a priority. Influencers have to safeguard the reputation they've built over time. They wouldn't want to risk losing trust and followers by promoting something they don't genuinely believe in.\n\nHow to Negotiate Terms and Agreements with YouTube Influencers\n\nYou’ve found your dream creator, and they’ve agreed to work with you!\n\nAs exciting as it is to onboard a content creator, don’t forget that your collaboration is a business relationship. \n\nThat means there’s some nitty gritty to hash out.\n\nEstablish Timelines and Deliverables\n\nBe upfront about the project scope. Establish clear expectations. And agree upon deadlines for the deliverables. \n\nFrom campaign messaging to product features, outline the elements you expect in the video—and communicate any specific guidelines or requirements. As a collaborative effort, be open to your creator’s suggestions and ideas, as these can spark an even greater outcome.\n\nEnsure you and your creator sign off on a well-defined project timeline that includes each person's roles and responsibilities and dates for ideation, drafting, and revision rounds, up to the launch date. The more detailed, the better, as it allows everyone to plan accordingly and keeps your campaign on track.\n\nAgree on Compensation\n\nInfluencers bring incredible value—and they deserve compensation for their time, creativity, and involvement.\n\nSome influencers may present you with a contract with their rates and terms of payment. But if not, it’s paramount to have this discussion, especially if you’re interested in developing a long-term relationship with them.\n\nBe open to negotiation based on your influencer’s online presence and their alignment with your brand. Consider both monetary and non-monetary compensation, such as product samples, affiliate partnerships, or a combination you can agree upon.\n\nTo estimate your YouTube influencer marketing cost, you can reference the average price per post mentioned in our creator marketing article. \n\nProvide Necessary Resources and Support\n\nGive your YouTube content creator as much information about your company, product, or service as possible. If you're more detailed, you're more likely to get a draft you like.\n\nMake sure they have everything they need for your initiative: logo and branding assets, product samples, and promo codes, for example.\n\nStep Three: Execute the Influencer Marketing Campaign\n\nTo quote Gary Vaynerchuk, “Ideas are worthless without the execution; execution is pointless without the ideas.”\n\nGetting your influencer campaign published on YouTube is why we’re here. But how does that happen, exactly?\n\nCollaborate in the Content Creation Process\n\nComing to the table with a main message, vision, or goal can be a powerful springboard in your campaign.\n\nMany content creators will dive deep into your brand and want to include you in the creative process.\n\nHowever, not all influencers take the same approach. You’ll need to strike a healthy balance between being involved and giving them license to flex their unique creativity.\n\nYou can choose to work closely with the YouTuber to develop a compelling video concept, ensuring that the video showcases your brand in an authentic way.\n\nOr, you can let them take full control and present their storyboard, script, and messaging for your review that you’ll tweak together.\n\nNo two influencer campaigns are the same, and neither is there a standard process for collaborating on your project. You’ll likely need time to adjust to each other’s cadence and develop a process of approving the content for launch.\n\nEngage with the YouTube Influencer and Their Audience\n\nWhen your YouTube masterpiece is finally live, it’s time to actively participate in the comments section.\n\nThis’ll let you know immediately how the audience is engaging with the content, giving you the opportunity to chime in and be a part of the discussion.\n\nSocial media is about being social—commenting and engaging with the community you hope to attract is good best practice and helps humanize your brand—another perk to using influencers.\n\nIt’s also a nice touch to show appreciation to your content creator for their collaboration—kudos are in order!\n\nThat’ll also show the audience that you’re genuinely interested in their community, and supporting the content creator ecosystem. \n\nStep Four: Analyze the Campaign Performance\n\nThere are many key performance indicators (KPIs) you can use to objectively measure the success of your influencer campaign. \n\nThe combination of them all helps paint a holistic view of your results.\n\nHere are some of the most important ones to note on your dashboard:\n\nReach and Awareness\nEngagement\nConversions\nAudience Growth Rate\nBrand Mentions\nCost per Post\nReturn on Investment (ROI)\nTraffic to your website\n\nWith this app’s Campaign Management feature, you can create your own UTMs and track your campaign’s clicks, views, CPM, and more.\n\nGo deeper into the impact analysis. Assess how the campaign influenced your brand's visibility—did it spike online conversations or attract new high-quality followers? \n\nAlso, delve into sales data. Did the influencer's endorsement lead to an upswing in product purchases, trials, or sign-ups? \n\nAnd… as a search engine, let’s not forget about measuring the performance of your YouTube channel and finding new ways to optimize it based on keyword trends.\n\nFor this, try the Rank Tracker for YouTube app. It can be found on the Semrush AppCenter.\n\nOptimize and Improve Your YouTube Rankings\n\nTo ensure you’re getting the most reach on YouTube, the Rank Tracker for YouTube app takes competing videos, search results, and SEO elements into account.\n\nAll you need to do is add your YouTube channel to the app, and upload up to 200 keywords you want to track.\n\nAfter your influencer campaign has gone into the world, head to the top-ranked keywords in the Overview tab to monitor your channel’s performance and rank compared to the previous week.\n\nEach keyword's crucial details are highlighted, encompassing the top-ranking content associated with it—be it a video, playlist, or channel. \n\nAdditionally, you'll find insights like the Topic Search Volume, indicating the keyword's popularity. \n\nThis chart reveals your channel or content's ranking in relation to the keyword and outlines the specific type of content that's ranking prominently. It tracks any changes in your ranking compared to the previous week, offering a comprehensive overview of your keyword performance.\n\nWhen you track your YouTube video rankings, you can be sure exactly which videos are performing the best and growing your audience. \n\nRemember, it's not just about numbers; it's about the story they tell. Combined, these analyses help you grasp the campaign's narrative, from engagement to impact, guiding you toward smarter, data-driven strategies.\n\nUse those learnings to inform your next campaign, now with the experience and understanding of what you’d do differently, and what worked well.\n\nGet Ready to Start Your First YouTube Influencer Campaign \n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively leverage YouTube influencer marketing to reach a wider audience and promote your brand online. Remember to choose the right YouTubers, build strong relationships, and execute the campaign creatively and authentically. \n\nWith the right approach, (and a willingness to experiment!) YouTube influencer marketing can be a powerful tool for your brand's success.",
