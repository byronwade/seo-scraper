  "content": "What Is Conversion Rate Optimization?\n\nConversion rate optimization (CRO) is the process of implementing different tactics to increase the percentage of visitors who convert (take a desired action) on your website.\n\nConversions can be many different activities, depending on what you want to achieve. \n\nThat can include:\n\nMaking a purchase\nSigning up for a free trial\nBooking a demo\nSubscribing to a newsletter\nCreating an account\n\nOptimizing conversion rates on your website can have a direct impact on your bottom line. \n\nAnd while other marketing disciplines like search engine optimization (SEO) usually take months to show results, CRO tactics can prove effective almost immediately.\n\nHow Is Conversion Rate Calculated?\n\nTo calculate the conversion rate for any page or for your entire website, divide the total number of conversions that occurred on your page or site during a specific time period by the total number of visitors to your page or site during that time period. And multiply the number by 100 to get a percentage. \n\nHere’s what the formula looks like:\n\nOnce you’ve calculated your conversion rate, you may be wondering whether it’s a good number.\n\nComparing yourself to some industry benchmarks can help you understand how strong your performance is.\n\nThe average conversion rate for B2C ecommerce businesses across all industries was 2% in the first quarter of 2023. And average conversion rates in the B2B space range from just over 1% for SaaS companies to over 7% for legal services.\n\nNow, let’s dive into why it’s so important to optimize your pages to improve this metric.\n\nBenefits of Conversion Rate Optimization\n\nWebsite conversion rate optimization benefits everything from your marketing costs to the sales process.\n\nLet’s explore these benefits more in detail:\n\nLower cost per acquisition (CPA): CRO can lower your overall CPA because you won’t have to invest in as many channels (especially paid ads) and tactics to drive conversions\nGreater understanding of customers: CRO involves thorough research that will help you better understand your audience and what motivates them to take action\nImproved competitive advantage: CRO helps your site’s pages drive more results than your competitors’ non-optimized content\nIncreased sales and revenue: CRO gets more users to convert, meaning it can help generate more sales and boost your revenue\nLower effort activity: CRO leverages existing content to convert more users, so you don’t have to start from scratch\n9 Conversion Rate Optimization Techniques\n\nLet’s dive into some concrete ways to boost the number of website users who convert.\n\nTailor Your Messaging to Your Audience\n\nUnderstanding your audience is the starting point of conversion rate optimization. Because this knowledge will allow you to tailor your messaging to their pain points and needs.\n\nSemrush’s One2Target tool can help you uncover valuable insights about your target audience. \n\nOpen the tool and enter up to five competitors. Then, click “Analyze.”\n\nFirst, you’ll see the “Demographics” tab. Which shows information about the audience’s age, country, etc.\n\nClick “Socioeconomics” to learn about the audience’s employment status, educational level, and more.\n\nNow, head to the “Behavior” tab. Where you can learn about the audience’s social media preferences, interests, and which type of device they use.\n\nLet’s say your analysis reveals this audience is primarily between the ages of 35 and 44, works full time, and lives in a household with four or more people. This suggests that your messaging should focus on the needs of working parents. \n\nYou can also learn more about your existing customers by conducting surveys. Which can give you immediate feedback about your website.\n\nYou can add a small survey that pops up when a customer is about to leave your site. Or one that sends to their email along with their purchase confirmation.\n\nSurvey results like these may give you an idea of why a customer left without converting. And help you identify ways to improve.\n\nTo increase the number of visitors who complete your survey, make it short and simple. You can say, “Take this one-minute survey.” To let them know you won’t be taking too much of their time.\n\nAlign Your Content with What Users Expect\n\nTo drive conversions, your webpages need to line up with what your audience wants. So, consider how they arrived on the page you want to optimize.\n\nIf they clicked on an ad, users will expect a landing page that’s consistent with what they saw in the ad.\n\nFor example, the landing page for an ad that promises a 50% discount on a specific product should similarly make that product and discount clearly visible. Any deviation may confuse the visitor and cause them to leave.\n\nFor webpages that are primarily intended to gain organic traffic through keywords, focus on search intent.\n\nSearch intent is the motivation behind a user’s search engine query. It represents what the user wants to achieve.\n\nWhy does search intent matter?\n\nBecause search engines like Google aim to deliver the most relevant, useful results to users. So, focusing on intent when creating content can lead to higher rankings, more traffic, and more conversions.\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool to analyze the search intent behind keywords to make sure they’re a good fit for the pages you want to optimize for conversions.\n\nLet’s say you own a sports footwear store and are considering focusing on the keyword “best running shoes” for a page comparing different options.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your target keyword, select a location, and click “Search.”\n\nIn the “Overview” dashboard, you’ll see the type of search intent behind the keyword.\n\nThen, scroll down to see what the search results look like. You can then analyze the top-ranking pages to better understand what searchers want.\n\nBy now, it’s clear that people searching this term are interested in doing research rather than immediately buying. Which means your intended page aligns with their intent.\n\nConduct Tests\n\nUsing A/B testing (also called split testing) on your pages helps you quickly identify what does and doesn’t encourage conversions on your website.\n\nA/B testing compares two versions of a webpage that differ by a single element. Like a headline or a call to action (CTA). \n\nMaybe you want to compare a subheading with a broader appeal against one intended specifically for working parents. Or test whether reducing the number of form fields will increase submissions. \n\nSome other elements you can A/B test include:\n\nImages\nBody copy\nForm placement\n\nYou can use Semrush’s SplitSignal tool to run A/B tests for your webpages. Let’s say you want to test the impact of using all capitalized text for the main heading (H1) copy on your product pages.\n\nOpen the tool and click on “Create new test”, then add a name and description.\n\nNext, choose the website section you’d like to inspect. This should be specific to the URL structure for the webpages you’re testing.\n\nThe next step is to filter for the specific pages that you want to test. By selecting “Contains” from the second drop-down menu. And making sure the correct URL path is entered.\n\nThen, click “Next.”\n\nUnder “Rule #1,” select “Change the text content of the element” and enter “h1” in the “CSS selector” field.\n\nClick the “Paste variable” drop-down menu and select “Current.” And then click the drop-down caret next to “Current” and choose “UPPER.”\n\nThen, click “Next.”\n\nChoose the duration for your test, review other elements, and click on “Launch.”\n\nYou can then review the results once the test has concluded. To see what impact the capitalization change had. \n\nDiversify Your CTAs\n\nUsing calls to action in multiple forms and locations across your pages may increase the chances of a visitor converting.\n\nFor example, blog posts often have a CTA in the conclusion. But that could mean you’re missing out on opportunities to convert users who may be interested in your brand but don’t read the entire page. \n\nSimilarly, CTA banners may sometimes be ineffective because people scroll right past them given how similar their appearance is to ads.\n\nBut if you use a combination of CTA buttons, in-text CTAs, banners, etc., you give users multiple chances to convert.\n\nRemove Distractions When Possible\n\nThere should be one prominent CTA on your page with little to distract from it. To ensure optimal chances for conversion. \n\nTake a landing page designed to drive demos, for example. \n\nYour goal is to have the user book a demo. But if there are other links like a navigation bar, that may distract users from taking this action because it diverts their attention. \n\nBy removing the navigation, you reduce distractions and keep the focus squarely on the desired action.\n\nTake HubSpot’s landing page for a guide to build an effective LinkedIn profile. There’s no navigation bar at the top that could potentially interrupt conversions:\n\nWhen you scroll down the page, you can get more information about the ebook. But you won’t see other links that take the focus away from downloading the guide.\n\nImprove Page Load Speed\n\nImproving page load speed improves the user experience. To keep users on the page and enable more conversions.\n\nMost pages should be able to load their main content within 2.5 seconds, according to Google. \n\nYou can use Semrush’s Site Audit tool to discover any pages on your website that need load speed improvement.\n\nOpen the Site Audit tool and click on “Create project.”\n\nEnter your domain and name the project. Then, click “Create project.”\n\nFollow the prompts to configure your basic settings for the audit. And click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nWhen the audit is ready, click on the “Issues” tab in your dashboard.\n\nEnter “speed” in the search bar at the top of the table. And you’ll see any pages that are taking too long to load in the table.\n\nSome of the most common tactics to improve page load speed include:\n\nCompressing images to reduce file sizes\nReducing the number of elements on the page—including images\nEnable caching to allow browsers to store static resources locally\nImplement lazy loading, which loads images only when they come into the user’s view\nApply What You’ve Learned from High-Converting Content\n\nAnalyzing which pages have driven the most conversions allows you to see which tactics have worked in the past. Then, you can implement them on other pages.\n\nYou can use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to do this.\n\nOpen GA4 and click on “Reports” in the left-hand sidebar. Then, select “Engagement” under “Life cycle” and click “Pages and screens.”\n\nYou’ll see a table that shows how different pages drive conversions. Filter them by a specific type by clicking on “All events”at the top of the “Conversions” column. \n\nYou may learn that a particular page was effective for driving a specific conversion type—such as booking a demo. Visit that page to identify which elements could be conversion drivers that can be applied to other pages. \n\nFor instance:\n\nCompelling visuals\nClear and concise copy\nProminent CTA placement\nActionable advice\nNo navigation bar\nConversational, jargon-free language\nPrioritize Above-the-Fold Content\n\nPrioritizing above-the-fold content means focusing on the page elements that users immediately see without scrolling. Which captures users’ attention and encourages them to take your desired action. \n\nHere’s how to optimize above-the-fold content.\n\nUse compelling, clear, and concise messaging that communicates the value proposition or main purpose of the page. Like in the Basecamp homepage example below.\nPlace the primary CTA in a visible location. For example, we’ve included one right below the subheading on this page.\nUse eye-catching, high-quality visuals\nAllow for plenty of white space to ensure the page doesn’t look cluttered\nRevamp Your Headlines and Subheadings\n\nEffective headlines highlight the key information and calls to action. And also structure the content and make it scannable.\n\nHow can you make your headings as strong as possible?\n\nUse action words (“drive,” “improve,” “increase,” etc.), include relevant keywords, and highlight the benefits of your product or service. \n\nOr, try posing questions to pique users’ curiosity.\n\nHeadlines and subheadings are also ideal for A/B testing.\n\nCRO Tools to Help You Execute Your Plans\n\nHere are a few of the best tools to help you carry out the conversion rate optimization process and measure your efforts:\n\nSplitSignal\n\nSplitSignal is an A/B testing tool that allows you to formulate your hypothesis, select variants, and launch your test in a few clicks.\n\nYou can install this tool with a snippet of JavaScript in just a few minutes.
