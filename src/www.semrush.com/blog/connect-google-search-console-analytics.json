  "content": "You can connect Google Search Console to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to get organic search data in your GA4 property.\n\nThe integration expands the level of detail you can get from Google Analytics. Once the two platforms are connected, you’ll get performance and ranking data for specific search queries and landing pages. All in one place.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn how to connect the two platforms. And how to get the most out of the integrated reports.\n\nWhy Should You Connect Search Console to Google Analytics?\n\nGoogle Search Console (GSC) helps you measure organic search performance in Google. So you can uncover SEO opportunities for your site.\n\nYou can connect GSC to Google Analytics to get that organic search performance data within your GA4 property. Where you can use it for common SEO tasks like:\n\nSharing detailed reports with stakeholders\nGenerating new content ideas\nPrioritizing pages that need a content update\nThe Data You Get When You Connect Search Console to Google Analytics\n\nThe “Search results” report in GSC displays data for four key performance metrics:\n\nTotal clicks: The number of clicks coming to your site from Google organic search\nTotal impressions: The number of times your pages appeared in Google search results\nAverage CTR: The number of clicks divided by the number of impressions (multiplied by 100 to give a percentage)\nAverage position: The average ranking of where your search results appeared on Google (across all impressions)\n\nBy default, the “Search results” report will show a graph of total clicks and total impressions. You can visualize different metrics by clicking into any of the four metrics. \n\nFor example, here’s what you’ll see when you turn off clicks and impressions and turn on average position:\n\nThese metrics provide an aggregated view of your performance. Search Console provides query-level information on the same four performance metrics. \n\nQueries are the specific search terms visitors typed into Google before finding your site (i.e., keywords). Here is an example showing the top search queries.\n\nOn its own, Google Analytics can’t display this granular, keyword-level data.\n\nWhy Google Analytics Needs Search Console Data\n\nGoogle Analytics is a free web analytics tool that can help you understand your website’s performance and the visitors who come to it.\n\nLike where they live, how often they visit, how they arrive, and what they do on the site. \n\nBut without connecting Google Search Console to Google Analytics, you won’t be able to see that all-important query-level data alongside your user behavior metrics.\n\nSo let’s find out how to combine the two platforms.\n\nHow to Connect Google Search Console to Google Analytics\n\nYou’ll need editor-level access to your Google Analytics 4 property before you begin.\n\nNote\n\nIf you haven’t set up GA4, here is how to set up Google Analytics. If you’ve already set up Search Console, skip ahead to step two.\n\n1. Verify Your Google Search Console Property\n\nYou need to be a verified owner of your Google Search Console property to link it to your GA4 property.\n\nYou can verify ownership in various ways depending on the specific way you set it up. These include verifying via HTML tags or by adding a TXT record via your DNS (domain name system) provider.\n\nFor a full guide on setting up GSC if you haven’t already, check out our Google Search Console tutorial.\n\n2. Go to Google Analytics and Access ‘Search Console Links’\n\nSign in to Google Analytics using the same Google account you use for Google Search Console.\n\nFrom the home screen, click on the gear icon in the bottom left to access the “Admin” section.\n\nClick “Product links” under your “Property settings.”\n\nScroll down and click “Search Console links.”\n\n3. Choose Your Search Console Property to Link\n\nOn the “Search Console links” screen, click the “Link” button at right-hand side. \n\nYou’ll only be able to link a Search Console property to a single GA4 property.\n\nYou’ll see a “Link setup” page like the one below. \n\nClick “Choose accounts” to see a list of Search Console properties. You will see all properties in which your email address is a verified owner.\n\nFind your property and select it using the checkbox on the left of the “Property Name.” Then, click “Confirm.”\n\n4. Pair Your Search Console Property with Your GA4 Web Stream\n\nNext, you’ll pair your Search Console property with your Google Analytics web data stream.\n\nA data stream is the place from which your Google Analytics data originates. Google Analytics 4 has three types of data streams:\n\niOS app\nAndroid app\nWeb\n\nYou can only connect Google Search Console to a Google Analytics 4 web stream (i.e., for a website, not an app). Click “Next.” \n\nThen, click “Select” to choose your Google Analytics web stream.\n\nYou’ll see the relevant web data stream in your GA4 property. Click it.\n\nClick “Next” again.\n\n5. Review and Submit Your Search Console Link\n\nYou’ll see a final review screen like the one below. \n\nClick “Submit” to complete the Search Console integration.\n\n6. Publish Your Reports\n\nYou need to publish your Search Console reports so you can find them within the “Reports” area in the left-hand navigation of GA4.\n\nTo do that, click “Reports.”\n\nThen, click “Library” to access your available reports.\n\nYou’ll see “Search Console” within your “Collection.” It may show an “Unpublished” status. (If it shows as “Published,” Google has already done your work for you, and you don’t need to do anything else here.)\n\nClick the vertical three-dot icon.\n\nThen, click “Publish.”\n\nNow that you’ve connected GSC and GA4, let’s see how you can use your new data.\n\nHow to Use Search Console Reports in GA4\n\nYour Search Console data appears in two different reports in GA4:\n\nQueries report\nGoogle organic search traffic report\n\nYou can now find both of these by clicking “Reports” within the primary left-hand navigation.\n\nYou’ll see your “Search Console” section below your “Life cycle” reports. Click on it to expand the individual reports. \n\nYou’ll see both the “Queries” report with keyword-level data, and the “Google organic search traffic report,” which has landing page data.\n\nLet’s start by looking at the Queries report.\n\nSearch Console Queries Report\n\nThe Queries report tells you about the specific search terms your visitors typed into Google before finding your site.\n\nIt can help you understand more about the needs of your visitors. And track how your site is ranking on Google for the individual keywords they are looking for. \n\nYou can also identify pages where your rankings are dropping. These can be great places to update your SEO efforts.\n\nThe report shows the same four metrics we reviewed earlier in this article, albeit with slightly different names: \n\nOrganic Google Search clicks\nOrganic Google Search impressions\nOrganic Google Search click through rate\nOrganic Google Search average position\n\nBy default, you’ll see your top 10 Google organic search queries ranked by the number of clicks each one received within the given time frame. \n\nYou can click the drop-down arrow to the right of “Rows per page” to display more queries.\n\nPro tip\n\nThe small arrow to the left of the “Organic Google Search clicks” header indicates the default sorting of the data table. You can sort in ascending or descending order by any other metric by clicking the column header.\n\nOn its own, the report provides a snapshot of your website’s Google organic search performance. You can use the date range selector to analyze your performance over time.\n\nBy default, you’ll see the past 28 days’ worth of data. You can get more detailed information by adding a comparison to your date range.\n\nFor example, you might want to compare your recent performance to the preceding 28-day performance. \n\nUse the “Compare” toggle to add a date range comparison.\n\nThe default comparison is the immediately preceding period. In our case, the 28 days before the most recent 28-day period. You can do a year-over-year analysis or use a custom time frame.\n\nWe’ll use the default comparison. Click “Apply.”\n\nYou’ll see three rows for each of your search queries:\n\nYour primary time range\nYour comparison time range\nThe percentage change over time\n\nThe third search query stands out in this example: \n\nYou’ll notice that it’s one of the site’s top click performers despite its low click-through rate. It represents almost half of all the site’s Organic Google Search impressions (473,990 out of 958,562). \n\nClicks also increased by 9.55%, despite the rankings drop during that time (going from an average position of 6.19 to 6.35).\n\nThis indicates that search interest is increasing for this term, but the page is likely not well-optimized. Which we can tell from the low click-through rate and dropping rankings.\n\nIt could be worth reviewing this piece of content to see if you can further optimize it for that search query and increase your organic traffic. And you can use Semrush to help with that.\n\nIn this example, we’ll use the Keyword Overview tool to learn more about the “emoji kitchen” keyword.\n\nType your keyword into the blank field. Then, click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll then get helpful metrics about the keyword. In this case two pieces of information are especially interesting:\n\nVolume (the average number of monthly searches) is 135k in the U.S., but if you look at “Global Volume,” you see there are three other countries that have at least that much search interest\nTrend shows the estimated interest over the preceding 12 months (Interest in this spiked recently.)\n\nYou don’t know what the future trend will look like. But if you optimize for the keyword now, you’ll be better positioned to drive a greater share of clicks if that trend continues. \n\nAnd you may want to consider optimizing for search in Turkey, India, and Japan, where search volume is equal to or greater than that in the U.S. for this term.\n\nThe “Keyword Ideas” section of the report can provide ideas to further optimize your existing page.\n\nOne simple way to do that is to use the “Questions” data. These are search questions that include a variant of your keyword.\n\nYou could use these terms to add an FAQ section at the bottom of your page to address these specific questions. This could help your page rank for those related keywords, while providing additional value to your readers.\n\nGet Valuable Keyword Insights\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nGoogle Organic Search Traffic Report\n\nThe Organic Search Traffic report tells you about your top landing pages in Google organic search.\n\nIt uses the same four metrics as the Queries report and combines them with more metrics from Google Analytics. These GA4 metrics tell you information like each page’s engagement rate, and the number of GA4 events tracked on each page.\n\nThe fifth landing page on the list looks like it’s the page where the “emoji kitchen” keyword is ranking. The “Engagement rate” for this page (42.47%) stands out because it’s much lower than the average across all pages (64.32%).\n\nEngagement rate is the percentage of sessions where a visitor satisfied at least one of the following conditions:\n\nViewed more than one page\nActively engaged with the page for at least 10 seconds\nCompleted a conversion (such as buying something or filling out a form)\n\nThe low engagement rate tells us that these kinds of valuable visits are happening less frequently on this page. This suggests you might want to update it to make it more helpful for your readers.\n\nTake Your Organic Search Data Further with Semrush\n\nGet useful keyword insights alongside your Google Search Console and Google Analytics data all in one place with Semrush.\n\nOrganic Traffic Insights combines three important sources of information:\n\nData from Google Search Console and Google Analytics for your top landing pages\nConversion data from Google Analytics so you can see which of those pages drive the most conversions\nKeyword ideas powered by Semrush so you can find ways to drive more traffic and get more conversions\n\nLook at the second landing page in the list. It accounts for over 35% of all your organic search conversions (41 out of 116) and 2.4% of all sessions for that page result in a conversion (41 out of 1,708). You also see that your sessions and your conversions are falling.\n\nYou want to use keyword data to find opportunities to improve your rankings and drive more traffic. To do that, click the hyperlinked number (129 in this case) to view Semrush keywords driving traffic to that page.\n\nThis will take you to a page showing keywords along with various metrics for each, including two that Google Search Console doesn’t show:\n\nVolume (estimated number of monthly searches) \nKeyword Difficulty (an estimate of how hard it would be to rank well for each keyword in organic search results)\n\nYou can use both of these metrics to find new keywords to target. You focus on the fifth keyword in the list, “ga4 active users.”\n\nYou see it has a Keyword Difficulty of 20%, which is lower than keywords for which you are already ranking in the first position on Google. Yet, your page is only ranking in the sixth position on Google for this term.\n\nThis could make it a prime candidate for a content update to improve your rankings for that keyword, boost your click-through rate, and get more conversions.\n\nWant to benefit from this kind of data on your own website?
