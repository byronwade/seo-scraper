  "content": "A reverse video search lets you find videos on the web. But it can do more than that. \n\nIt can help you grow your brand, too.\n\nLearn how to reverse search a video using popular tools. To identify copyright infringement, backlink opportunities, and content ideas.\n\nWhat Is a Reverse Video Search?\n\nA reverse video search is when you use an image from a video—like a thumbnail—to find webpages that feature the video. Different search engines and tools enable you to perform these searches.\n\nHere’s how a reverse video search looks on Google:\n\nThis type of search can provide the original source of the video (as shown above) and other places the video has been published. Along with related content. \n\nIt’s similar to a reverse image search, where you search for similar images online. Like this:\n\nAnd a reverse video search differs from traditional search that uses keywords and phrases to search for videos. Like this:\n\nHow Does Reverse Video Search Work?\n\nGoogle and other search engines store—or index—thumbnails from videos in their databases.\n\nAnd when you upload a video’s thumbnail for a reverse video search, the tool uses algorithms to analyze the colors and pixels in the photo. \n\nThen, the tool references its index to display similar matches in your search results. \n\nThe caveat is you usually need to search for videos using a thumbnail—not a video.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nSearch engines don’t index all of the frames from videos because it’s uneconomical. And would require the storage of quadrillions of images. \n\nThey usually only index a video’s thumbnail. If the video doesn’t have one, Google will extract a frame from the video to use as its thumbnail.\n\nThis is why you might not find videos if you search using screenshots from random points in the video. Because those frames aren’t likely indexed anywhere.\n\nFurther reading: Video SEO: How to Get Your Videos Ranked on Google\n\nHow to Reverse Search a Video on Desktop\n\nUse one—or more—of the tools below to perform your reverse search. \n\nNote\n\nBefore performing a reverse video search, you’ll need an image from the video (a thumbnail works best). Tools like YouTube Thumbnail Grabber can give you the thumbnail of any YouTube video to download and save. If you can’t find a thumbnail, take a screenshot from a notable time within the video. \n\n1. Google\n\nConduct reverse video searches on Google using its Image Search.\n\nHere’s how: \n\nNavigate to Google Images and select the camera icon to search by image: \n\nUpload the video image. \n\nGoogle will search its database and find similar images. Click “See exact matches” to view all instances of the video (including its original source). \n\nIf you’re searching for your own video content, the “exact match” search can help you find other websites that have posted your video.\n\n2. Bing\n\nBing is another search engine that can perform reverse video searches.\n\nTo get started, head to Bing’s Visual Search and upload the video’s image.\n\nBing will display a list of relevant images. Which might help you find the video’s original source. Or give you ideas for related content.\n\n3. TinEye\n\nTinEye is a tool specifically made for reverse search. Its paid plan alerts you when one of your images or videos appears on a webpage. So you don’t have to manually perform this task. \n\nTo use TinEye, open the website and upload your image. \n\nTinEye displays a list of similar images. Enter a website into the search bar (like reddit.com) to filter your results by a specific domain. \n\n4. SmallSEOTools\n\nSmallSEOTools performs reverse video searches for three different search engines at once: Google, Bing, and Yandex. \n\nThe free version allows you to upload one image at a time. While the premium version allows you to upload multiple images at once. \n\nHead to the tool and upload your video’s image. And click “Search Similar Images.”\n\nTo view the results, click “Show Matches” for each search engine.\n\n5. Shutterstock\n\nShutterstock can reverse video search for videos within their own database. \n\nSay you’re watching a video that has stock footage. And you want to use the same stock footage in your content. Take a screenshot of the stock footage and use Shutterstock to find similar stock videos.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nHead to Shutterstock’s Reverse Image Search for Video. Click “Search by image” and upload your image.\n\nShutterstock will return stock videos similar to your image that you can purchase to use in your own content.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s AI Video Automator to instantly create videos based on a prompt. And repurpose blog posts into eye-catching videos for your audience. \n\nReverse Video Search on Mobile: iOS and Android\n\nRunning a reverse video search on mobile devices is similar to desktop searches.\n\nFirst, get a screenshot from the video you want to reverse search:\n\nTo take a screenshot on an iPhone, press the power button and the “volume up” button simultaneously\nTo take a screenshot on an Android phone, press the power button and “volume down” button simultaneously\n\nThen, use the following apps to do a reverse video search with your screenshot:\n\nGoogle (iOS, Android)\nImage Search: Reverse Search (iOS, Android)\nReverse Image Search- Multi (Android) \nReverse Image Search App (iOS)\nWhy Use a Reverse Video Search?\nBacklink Opportunities\n\nA video reverse search shows you if other websites have your video embedded on them. So you can ask for attribution and a backlink—which can help your site and video rank higher in search results. \n\nOnce you have a list of sites to contact, our Link Building Tool makes it easy to perform outreach. \n\nTo start, configure the tool using our Link Building Tool configuration guide. \n\nThen, add the domains that don’t link to your video to your “Prospects” list in the tool. And draft and send a personalized email asking for a link. \n\nUse Semrush’s Backlink Analytics to monitor your outreach campaign’s results. View the report to see all the domains linking to your video (look for your video’s URL in the “Anchor and Target URL” column”). \n\nTip\n\nClick the “New” and “Lost” tabs to see whether sites have recently linked (or removed a link) to your video. Consider reaching out to see why they removed it. And offer another relevant video they can link to instead.\n\nWhen you see that a website has given you a link, return to the Link Building Tool and click the checkmark. This moves the link to the “Monitor” list, where you can check to see if the backlink remains active.\n\nMonitor Video Backlinks\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nEnforcing Copyright\n\nSearching for your videos helps you monitor your content. And find instances where someone has used your video within their content without permission or proper citation.\n\nThis proactive approach lets you safeguard your work. And control where your brand shows up online.\n\nThe challenge to reverse video search with copyright enforcement is you might not find your videos. Especially if the offending party changes the thumbnail. Or alters the video.\n\nBut YouTube has tools like the Copyright Match Tool and Content ID for eligible accounts. These tools create video fingerprints—unique identifiers based on visual and audio output—for each video. \n\nThen, YouTube notifies you if someone uploads a video with your video’s fingerprint on the platform. This can be an effective way of enforcing copyright if you publish your videos to YouTube.\n\nFurther reading: YouTube SEO: How to Boost Your Channels’ Visibility\n\nContent Ideas\n\nReverse searches display related content, which can help inspire new content ideas. \n\nFor example, say you perform a reverse video search with a cooking video featuring a certain dish. \n\nThis could yield search results featuring similar dishes with different presentations, ingredients, and cooking methods. These variations might inspire new content ideas.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse our Topic Research tool to get unlimited content ideas for videos, blog posts, and more. \n\nLocating a Video’s Source\n\nReverse video search can help you find the original source of a video. \n\nThis can be useful if you want to fact-check the video. Or cite the video in a piece of content like a blog post or a video of your own. \n\nFor example, this YouTube video features a different user’s video on a trending cake. Reverse-searching for the cake featured in the video reveals its original source. \n\nIdentifying the source of the video lets you verify its authenticity and credibility. And ensures you give your audience accurate information.\n\nFurther reading: Video Marketing: The Ultimate Guide\n\nUse Reverse Video Searches to Strengthen Your Brand\n\nVideo reverse searches help you with a variety of tasks. Including building backlinks.\n\nMonitor each video backlink you get with our Link-Building Tool and Backlink Analytics.
