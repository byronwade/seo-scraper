  "content": "Google Analytics offers a treasure trove of data. But for beginners, it can seem overwhelming.\n\nWhere do you start? What metrics actually matter?\n\nIn this post, we'll cover the 12 most important metrics in Google Analytics. These provide the clearest picture of your website's performance.\n\nWe’ll explain what each metric means, why it's useful to track, and how to analyze it.\n\nBut before we do that, let’s make sure we understand what metrics actually are.\n\nWhat Are Metrics in Google Analytics 4?\n\nIn Google Analytics 4 (GA4), metrics are the quantitative aspects of your data that help you understand and track the performance of your website. \n\nFor example, the metric “Users” shows you how many users visited your website over a given time period.\n\nAnd the metric “Conversions” tells you how many desired actions visitors have completed, like purchases, signups, downloads, etc.\n\nThere are plenty of other important Google Analytics metrics. Such as:\n\nSessions\nBounce rate\nNew users\nAverage engagement time\nSession conversion rate\n\nWe’ll cover all these metrics later in this guide. But metrics aren’t the only important measure in Google Analytics 4. You also need to understand dimensions.\n\nMetrics—along with dimensions—are the key building blocks of your analytics reports.\n\nHere’s how metrics and dimensions differ:\n\nMetrics vs. Dimensions in Google Analytics 4\n\nMetrics are quantitative measurements. They represent the “how much” or “how many” in your data using a numerical value.\n\nDimensions, on the other hand, are non-numeric attributes. They describe the who, what, where, when, and why behind the metrics.\n\nGoing back to an earlier example, the “Users” metric tells you exactly how many people visited your site.\n\nAnd the dimension “Country” contextualizes that number by telling you where those users are located.\n\nThe dimension “Device Category” tells you which devices users browse your website on.\n\nTogether, metrics and dimensions give you a comprehensive chart to measure and understand a website's performance.\n\nFurther reading: Dimensions in Google Analytics 4\n\n12 Important Metrics in Google Analytics 4\n1. Users \n\nThe “Users” metric represents the number of people who visited your website during a selected time frame.\n\nThis metric is super helpful for understanding the size of your audience and tracking growth over time. \n\nMore users = a larger reach.\n\nTo see how many users you got, go to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Acquisition” > “Overview.”\n\nView the overall trend to see if you're attracting more users over time. This indicates growth.\n\nIf you aren't seeing an increase in users, that means you need to revisit your marketing strategy.\n\nRead our full guide on how to create effective marketing strategies and get started.\n\n2. Sessions\n\nThe “Sessions” metric shows the number of individual browsing sessions that occurred on your site during the selected time period.\n\nSessions are initiated when a user enters your site. And end after 30 minutes of inactivity or when a user leaves.\n\nA single session can encompass multiple activities, such as viewing one or more pages, clicking on links or buttons, or making purchases.\n\nTracking the “Sessions” metric helps you understand engagement beyond just visitors. High sessions mean people are interested in your content, products, or services.\n\nTo find your “Sessions” metric, navigate to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”\n\nHere, you can see the total number of sessions and how they are distributed across multiple traffic sources.\n\nIdentify your top traffic sources driving sessions. And double down on your efforts for them.\n\nIf it’s “Organic Search,” step up your search engine optimization (SEO) game. \n\nIf it’s “Email,” enhance your email marketing campaigns.\n\n3. New Users\n\nThe “New Users” metric shows the number of first-time users who visited your site during the selected time period.\n\nTracking new users tells you how effective your marketing efforts are at reaching new audiences.\n\nMore new users = your marketing and content are attracting a fresh audience.\n\nTo check your new users, go to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Acquisition” > “Acquisition overview.”\n\nView the overall trend to look for patterns, such as spikes or declines. These can indicate the impact of your marketing efforts.\n\nFor instance, a sudden increase in new users could be the result of a viral social media post or a successful advertising campaign.\n\nOn the other hand, a decline might suggest that your recent marketing activities are not effectively engaging potential customers.\n\nOnce again, consider revisiting your strategy for better results.\n\n4. Average Engagement Time\n\nThe “Average engagement time” metric shows how long, on average, users actively engage with your site.\n\nFor example, if a user opens your website and spends five minutes reading an article, then this time is counted toward their \"Average engagement time.\" As your website is in focus and the user is actively engaged.\n\nHowever, if the user opens a new tab and starts browsing another site while your site remains open in the background, this time is not counted. Because your website is no longer the primary focus in the browser.\n\nIn other words, “Average engagement time” is calculated based on how long your website was in focus in the user’s browser.\n\nThis metric is particularly useful for understanding the quality of user engagement. \n\nTo see the “Average engagement time” metric for your site, go to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Engagement” > “Overview.”\n\nHigh average engagement times typically indicate that users find your content compelling and relevant, keeping them actively involved with your site. \n\nConversely, lower average engagement times suggest that you might need to improve your content and/or website usability.\n\nHere are some tips for that:\n\nEnsure your website is easy to navigate and loads quickly \nOptimize content for readability. Use scannable formatting like bullet points, subheads, short paragraphs, etc. This ensures users continue to read and engage with your content.\nUse visual assets like images, infographics, and videos. This helps to retain user attention.\n5. Bounce Rate\n\nThe “Bounce rate” is the percentage of non-engaged sessions.\n\nA non-engaged session is one where a user leaves your website in less than 10 seconds. Without triggering any event (like filling out a form) or clicking through to other pages.\n\nFor example, if a visitor lands on your homepage and exits within 10 seconds without clicking on any links, or completing actions like filling out a form, or making a purchase, this session is classified as a non-engaged session.\n\nAnd the “Bounce rate” metric will count this instance toward its calculation.\n\nA high bounce rate often indicates that the webpage is not effectively capturing the interest of visitors.\n\nThis could be due to various factors like unappealing web design, unclear messaging, slow page loading times, or content that doesn't match the user's intent.\n\nConversely, a lower bounce rate suggests users are finding what they are looking for and are encouraged to engage further with your website. By reading more content, viewing products, or performing other meaningful actions.\n\nTo see your bounce rate in GA4, you’ll need to customize your “Pages and screens” report.\n\nGo to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Engagement” > “Pages and screens.”\n\nIn the top right of your screen, click the pencil icon to customize your report.\n\nChoose “Metrics” from the “Report Data” section.\n\nFrom the “Add metric” drop-down, choose “Bounce rate.” And “Apply.”\n\nYou should now see the bounce rate in your “Pages and screens” report.\n\nNow, filter by high bounce rate pages.\n\nThese are pages that may need optimization. \n\nFirst, review your page design and messaging. Is it appealing? Does it clearly communicate what the page is about?\n\nSecondly, check the load time. (You can use Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool for that.)\n\nHigh load time increases the probability of users quitting your site. If you need help, read our full guide on how to improve your page speed.\n\nAnd last but not least, check if your content aligns with your audience’s needs. \n\nHigh-quality, relevant content is crucial for keeping users engaged.\n\n6. Session Conversion Rate\n\nThe “Session conversion rate” metric represents the percentage of sessions that resulted in a conversion. \n\nA conversion can be any predefined action that is valuable to your business. Such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, filling out a contact form, or downloading a resource. \n\nThe formula for calculating it is:\n\nSession conversion rate = (Number of conversions / Number of sessions) * 100\n\nThis metric helps in assessing the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns in driving conversions.\n\nTo track the “Session conversion rate” in GA4, you’ll first need to create events.\n\nEvents let you measure user interactions (like loading a page, clicking a link, or making a purchase).\n\nSo for every action you want to measure the conversion rate for, you’ll create an event.\n\nAfter creating events, you can now find your “Session conversion rate.”\n\nGo to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”\n\nThen, find the pencil icon in the upper right corner.\n\nFind “Metrics.”\n\nThen, “Add metric.” And look for “Session conversion rate.”\n\nThen, click “Apply.”\n\nYou should now see “Session conversion rate” in your “Traffic acquisition report.”\n\nNow that you know your session conversion rate, you should be clear on the performance of your website and marketing efforts in terms of driving valuable actions.\n\n7. Entrances\n\nThe “Entrances” metric shows the number of sessions that began on a particular page.\n\nEvery time a user initiates a new session, the “Entrances” metric for that particular page where the session begins increases.\n\nThis metric is important for understanding how users begin their journey on your site.\n\nTo see the “Entrances” metric in GA4, follow these steps: \n\n1. Go to the “Explore” area in your GA dashboard\n\n2. Click on “Blank” to start a new exploration\n\n3. Click on the “+” icon next to “DIMENSIONS.”\n\nA new window will open up.\n\n4. Select “Page title” (found under the “Page / screen” category)\n\n5. Click on “Import” to add it to your exploration\n\n6. Click on the “+” icon next to “METRICS”\n\n7. Find and select “Entrances” under the “Page / screen” category\n\n8. Click on “Import” to include this metric in your analysis\n\n9. Drag “Page title” into the “ROWS” area. This will list the pages as row headers.\n\n10. Drag the “Entrances” metric to the “VALUES” area. This will display the ​​number of entrances started on each page.\n\nNow that you know which pages people generally “enter” your site from, make sure those pages are engaging and clear. So that they convert better.\n\n8. Exits\n\nThe “Exits” metric shows how many sessions ended on a particular page.\n\nFor example, if five people ended their engagement with your website on your pricing page, then your pricing page will have five “Exits.”\n\nThis metric is crucial for identifying which pages are most commonly the last interaction point before users leave your site.\n\nTo see your exit counts in GA4, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the “Explore” section in your dashboard\n\n2. Click “Blank” to start a new exploration\n\n3. Click on the “+” icon next to “DIMENSIONS”\n\nA new window will pop up.\n\n4. Select “Page title” (under the “Page / screen” category)\n\n5. Click on “Import” to add it to your exploration\n\n6. Click on the “+” icon next to “METRICS”\n\n7. Find and select “Exits” under the “Page / screen” category\n\n8. Click on “Import” to include this metric in your analysis\n\n9. Drag “Page title” into the “ROWS” area. This will list the pages as row headers.\n\n10. Drag the “Exits” metric to the “VALUES” area. This will display the exit counts for each page.\n\nTry to identify any common patterns among the pages with high exits. \n\nAre these pages lacking engaging content? Do they have a confusing layout or navigation?\n\nUnderstanding these patterns can help you pinpoint areas for improvement.\n\n9. Views Per User\n\nThe “Views per user” metric shows the average number of pages users see during a specified time frame.\n\nIt is calculated by dividing the total number of page views by the total number of users in the same time frame.\n\nA higher “Views per user” signals you're creating sticky content that keeps users engaged. Prompting them to further explore your website.\n\nTo check your “Views per user” metric in GA4, go to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Engagement” > “Pages and screens.”\n\nThe report will now show the average pages each user sees during a session. \n\nIf you want to improve this metric, make sure your navigation menu is well-designed and promotes further site exploration.\n\nAlso, strengthen internal linking between related content. Our internal linking guide covers exactly how to do that.\n\n10. Engaged Sessions\n\nThe “Engaged session” metric measures any time a session lasts longer than 10 seconds, has at least two page views, or triggers a conversion event. \n\nA high number of engaged sessions suggests your site is meeting the needs and expectations of your users.\n\nOtherwise, users wouldn’t be engaging with your site.\n\nTo find engaged sessions in GA4, go to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”\n\nHere, you’ll see the total number of engaged sessions and how they are distributed across multiple traffic sources.\n\nConsider prioritizing channels that are bringing in a high number of engaged sessions. \n\n11. Engagement Rate\n\nThe “Engagement rate” represents the percentage of engaged sessions. Compared to the total number of sessions. \n\nA session is considered engaged any time it lasts longer than 10 seconds, has at least two page views, or triggers a conversion event. \n\nThis metric provides a clear indicator of how effectively your site captures and holds the attention of users.\n\nTo check your engagement rate, go to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”\n\nThen scroll to the right side of the report. You’ll see your engagement rate across different traffic channels. \n\nOnce again, prioritize channels that are already performing well for you.\n\n12. Returning Users\n\nThe “Returning users” metric shows the number of users who visited your site more than once during the selected time frame.\n\nIt’s the opposite of first-time visitors (“New users”).\n\nTracking returning users is key for understanding:\n\nUser retention and loyalty (i.e., whether users keep coming back)\nHow well you convert new users into repeat visitors\nWhat part of your audience comes back often\n\nTo check your returning users, you need to customize your “User acquisition” report.\n\nGo to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Acquisition” > “User acquisition.”\n\nOn the top right of your screen, click the pencil icon to customize your report.\n\nChoose “Metrics” from the “Report Data” section.\n\nFrom the “Add metric” drop-down, choose “Returning users.” And click “Apply.”\n\nYou should now see the returning users in your “User acquisition” report.\n\nUse this metric to determine whether you need to create more targeted and effective retention strategies.\n\nIf it’s high, keep on doing what you’re doing. If it’s low, look into new marketing campaigns.\n\nThis might include personalized email campaigns, loyalty programs, or content that caters to the interests of these repeat visitors. \n\nWhich Metrics Should You Track?\n\nThe Google Analytics metrics you track should align with your business goals. This way, you can determine what’s going well and what you need to change.\n\nSay you want to understand the user engagement with your website. You might track the “Average engagement time,” “Bounce rate,” and “Views per user” metrics\n\nBut if you want to understand how your marketing campaign performed, you might track “Sessions” and the “Session conversion rate.”\n\nIf the metric isn’t of interest to you or a part of your business goals, it likely isn’t worth your time to track it. Over time, you’ll get a stronger feel for the Google Analytics website metrics you actually care about.\n\nIntegrate Google Analytics with Semrush\n\nIf you’re a Semrush user, you can connect GA4 data directly to the Semrush interface.\n\nThat allows you to view all your website’s data—including your Google Analytics performance metrics—from a central location.
