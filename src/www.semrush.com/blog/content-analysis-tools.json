  "content": "What Are Content Analysis Tools?\n\nContent analysis tools help you identify opportunities to improve content in various ways.\n\nSome tools focus on SEO performance, while others focus on other useful feedback like grammatical errors or readability. \n\nSome can do both. \n\nBut the fundamental purpose is to help you improve content.\n\nThe 10 Best Content Analysis Tools\n\nIf you’re on a tight budget, start with the simpler free tools.\n\nIf you want the best tools to maximize your content performance, skip down to the more comprehensive options.\n\nSimple (and Free) Content Analysis Tools\n1. Hemingway App\n\nHemingway is a free tool for improving the clarity and readability of writing.\n\nYou copy text into the editor, and it highlights various color-coded opportunities for improvement.\n\nIt’s a fast way to identify things like:\n\nSentences that are long or difficult to read\nComplex language that could be simpler\nPhrases that use the passive voice\n\nIt’s one of the simplest content analyzer tools available. You can use it without even signing up.\n\nWhat We Like\nSimple to use, with quick and clear feedback\nA generous free-forever version\nAI rewrites and integrations are available by upgrading\nPricing\n\nHemingway's web app is free. \n\nHowever, you can buy the desktop application for Mac or PC for $19.99 (one-time fee). It gives you offline access and premium features like integrations with WordPress and Medium.\n\nYou can also buy a Hemingway Editor Plus subscription for $10/month, which lets you use artificial intelligence (AI) to rewrite sentences. There’s also a 14-day, 200-sentence free trial available.\n\n2. ChatGPT \n\nChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool. It uses AI and machine learning to generate responses to user inputs.\n\nIn the context of content analysis, ChatGPT is capable of handling functions similar to Hemingway. But with more flexibility.\n\nFor example, you could take a passage of text and ask ChatGPT to review it. Here’s an example prompt and output.\n\nWhile other tools like Hemingway analyze a fixed set of criteria, ChatGPT is more versatile. Tailor your prompt according to what you’re trying to achieve. \n\nFor example, you could also ask ChatGPT if you sound too formal. Or if there are any spelling mistakes (and so on).\n\nThen, ask the tool to rewrite sentences according to the feedback—if you agree it makes sense.\n\nIt isn’t as straightforward to use as Hemingway, and there’s some degree of learning curve. Your results will only be as good as your prompts. But overall, it’s much more versatile and covers more use cases. \n\nFor example, you could also get feedback from ChatGPT on how to improve your writing from an SEO perspective. And increase the chances of your content ranking in Google for target keywords.\n\nHere are some prompt ideas. You could ask ChatGPT to:\n\nCompare your content vs. a successful competitor’s to find gaps you haven’t yet covered\nSuggest frequently asked questions around your topic (and generate draft answers to them)\nSuggest internal linking opportunities to other related pages\n\nHowever, if your goal is to optimize content for search, the process is simpler using a dedicated SEO tool like Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant (more on that below).\n\nWhat We Like\nVersatile tool that can assist with both optimizing for search and readability\nIt can rewrite content as well as analyze content\nPricing\n\nChatGPT is available for free. \n\nChatGPT Plus is available for $20/month, which gives you access to GPT-4 and advanced features like browsing (which lets the AI tool browse the web).\n\n3. Google Search Console\n\nGoogle Search Console (GSC) is a free tool to understand the organic performance of your website.\n\nIt has other uses (such as technical SEO), but for the purpose of content analysis, some of the key use cases are to check:\n\nHow much organic search traffic each webpage receives\nWhat users are typing into Google to find those pages\nYour organic positions (how highly your pages rank in the results)\n\nChecking which keywords your pages rank for (and the average positions) can be a great way to find content worth updating.\n\nTo do that, go to Google Search Console and click “Search results” in the left sidebar (or “Full report”).\n\nNext, click “Average position” to show position data, then click on the “Position” column header to sort by positions.\n\nLook for queries where your position is 11-20. These pages make good targets for content updates. \n\nThere’s a chance that updating the content to add more value to readers will nudge your page into the top 10 results, where you’re more likely to start generating clicks.\n\nWhat We Like\nIt’s a great tool for understanding the organic performance of webpages\nIt’s entirely free and simple to use\nPricing\n\nGoogle Search Console is available for free, with no paid version.\n\n4. Grammarly\n\nGrammarly is another writing and editing tool with a generous free version.\n\nLike Hemingway, it can review readability. But it also checks spelling, punctuation, and more.\n\nColor-coded suggestions make it clear where to make improvements.\n\nRed shows suggested fixes for spelling, punctuation, and grammar\nBlue highlights show areas where to improve the clarity of your writing\nGreen highlights mark suggestions to make your content more engaging\n\nGrammarly isn’t as simple as Hemingway because it has more features overall. It offers:\n\nOne-click edits to fix the errors and redundancies it finds\nA more granular writing score out of 100\nCharacter and word counts\nReading or speaking time\n\nGrammarly also lets you customize the suggestions it gives by asking your goals. \n\nFor example, word choices might differ slightly depending on how formal you want to sound. Or how knowledgeable your audience is.\n\nThere’s also a Chrome extension that allows you to get the core functionality of Grammarly anywhere on the internet. For example, in your email inbox.\n\nWhat We Like\nMore customizable than simpler alternatives like Hemingway\nExtensive features in the free version\nUseful Chrome extension\nPricing\n\nGrammarly has a free version available. \n\nGrammarly Premium starts at $30 per month for the individual plan and gives you access to features like AI text generation, plagiarism checks, and writing tone feedback.\n\nFor teams, Grammarly Business plans are available starting at $15/seat/month (minimum three seats).\n\n5. Rockee\n\nRockee lets you take a different approach to content analysis using real user feedback.\n\nIt is a content feedback platform that helps you understand what readers actually think about your content.\n\nCreate a widget, embed it onto your site, and ask readers to rate your content. \n\nThen, collect a simple rating, data about who your reader is (e.g., job title), and collect comments.\n\nOnce you’ve optimized your content for readability and SEO using other tools, adding user feedback will help you understand if it really resonates.\n\nRockee also integrates with Google Analytics 4 (GA4). It allows you to combine quantitative data (like time on page or conversion rate) with your feedback and ratings for a more complete picture.\n\nWhat We Like\nIt enables qualitative feedback directly from your readers\nIt’s quick and simple to set up\nPricing\n\nThe free version of Rockee lets you customize a feedback widget and collect up to 15 responses per month. Paid plans start from £39/month (around $49/month).\n\nMore Comprehensive (Paid) Content Analysis Tools\n6. Semrush\n\nSemrush is an all-in-one tool suite for online marketing. It has various tools that assist with content analysis.\n\nOne of the most useful is SEO Writing Assistant. It analyzes your writing and suggests improvements.\n\nIt can suggest writing improvements in four areas:\n\nReadability: The tool highlights long paragraphs, hard-to-read sentences, use of passive voice, and complex words\nSEO: Set target keywords and get recommendations for which related keywords to include\nOriginality: Check for signs of plagiarism and find the sources of any unoriginal content\nTone of Voice: Set a target tone of voice (casual, neutral, or formal) to get recommendations for things like word choice and pacing\n\nTo use SEO Writing Assistant, open the tool and click “Analyze my text.”\n\nCopy and paste your article into the editor (or write new text). \n\nIn the right sidebar, add target keywords. You’ll get recommendations to help your content perform better in organic searches for those keywords.\n\nSelect your target audience (location, language, and device type). Then, click “Get recommendations.”\n\nYou’ll receive a score out of 10 to indicate your content’s overall quality. And detailed feedback is broken down by each core area mentioned above.\n\nClick any of the categories (e.g., “SEO”) to get recommendations in the sidebar. \n\nFor example, which related keywords to include in your text, or advice on adding internal links.\n\nThere is also a feature called “Smart Writer” that can rephrase text and write new passages of text using AI. It’s a great way to overcome writer’s block.\n\nSemrush SEO Writing Assistant has integrations with Google Docs, WordPress, and Microsoft Word. So you get the benefits wherever you prefer to work.\n\nSemrush also has several other tools that can help with content analysis, including:\n\nContentShake: Uses AI to help you find the right angle for your content, generate a recommended outline, analyze competitor content, and more\nSite Audit: Checks for 140+ potential issues, including duplicate content, thin content, and more\nPosition Tracking: Helps you to analyze how your content performs in organic search rankings\nWhat We Like\nComprehensive suite of content tools within one subscription\nBoth SEO and style analysis in the same tool\nVery simple and easy to use\nPricing\n\nAll Semrush Guru and Business plans include access to SEO Writing Assistant. For those plans, pricing starts at $249.95 per month.\n\nSemrush offers a free trial for seven days.\n\nGet Content Analysis\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\n7. Surfer\n\nSurfer is a content writing toolkit. It has content analysis features that aim to help users with SEO. Including:\n\nAn audit tool to analyze existing content\nA content editor for writing and editing new content\nAI tools for generating outlines and writing full AI articles\nA keyword research tool\n\nThe content editor is one of the most commonly used tools.\n\nIt works by taking your target keyword and analyzing the current organic search results. Based on what’s currently ranking, the tool gives recommendations on things like:\n\nThe ideal word count\nWhich keywords to include (and how often)\nQuestions to answer\nSubheadings to use\n\nThe user interface is easy to use, and the recommendations are easy to understand.

Frase\n\nFrase is an AI tool for SEO research that creates outlines and generates AI writing.\n\nYou give Frase a target keyword, and it uses a combination of search engine results page (SERP) data and AI to give recommendations. Including recommended word count, keywords to include, and questions to answer.\n\nA strength of Frase is the outline builder. You can:\n\nReview the outlines of the articles in the current SERP and select which ones you want to include\nAdd/edit subheadings manually\nGenerate an entire outline with AI\n\nFrom there, you can:\n\nWrite directly in the editor\nGenerate a shareable link to send an outline to a writer\nGenerate content using AI\nWhat We Like\nAccessible entry pricing for solo users and a reasonably priced unlimited plan for heavy users\nSolid at analyzing competitor content and creating content briefs\nGood AI writing and editing features\nPricing\n\nFrase has an accessible entry price, starting at $14.99/month.

MarketMuse\n\nMarketMuse is a suite of tools used for content analysis, research, planning, and optimization.\n\nThere are some similarities to the tools mentioned above. \n\nFor example, it has highly similar core content optimization features that offer suggested keywords, word counts, and so on.\n\nIt also has a content brief builder, which works similarly to Frase’s.\n\nOne additional unique feature of MarketMuse is the competitive content analysis feature.\n\nUse it to understand how well your competitors in the SERP cover various related topics in their content.

And paid plans start from $149/month.\n\n10. Clearscope\n\nClearscope works similarly to Surfer and other tools above. It analyzes the current organic results for your target keyword to give content recommendations.\n\nIt gives a content grade (e.g., A+ or B-) that reflects how well optimized your article is for your target keyword.\n\nIt has fewer features overall compared to Surfer or Frase, which makes it easier to learn.
