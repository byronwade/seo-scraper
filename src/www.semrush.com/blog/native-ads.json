  "content": "What Are Native Ads?\n\nNative ads are a type of paid advertisement that blends with the look and feel of the content on the platform where they appear.\n\nAnd native advertising lets you engage your audience across different channels. Such as search engines, social media feeds, and content discovery platforms like Google Discover, Feedly, Reddit, Quora, and more.\n\nNative ad formats include:\n\nArticles \nSocial posts \nImages\nVideos \n\nThese ads are typically marked as “Sponsored,” “Promoted,” or “Ad.”\n\nFor example, Think with Google uses native advertising to promote content on LinkedIn:\n\nA native ad fits seamlessly into the page content and design. So it looks like organic content. \n\nHere’s what native advertising looks like on a Google search engine results page (SERP):\n\nUnlike display ads, native advertising doesn’t disrupt the user experience. That’s why it’s a popular paid advertising tactic.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to get relevant keyword ideas for your native advertising strategy. \n\nNative Ads vs. Display Ads\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of the differences between native and display ads:\n\n \t\n\nNative Ads\n\n\t\n\nDisplay Ads\n\n\n\n\nIdeal for\n\n\t\n\nContent promotion, brand awareness, engagement, building trust\n\n\t\n\nBrand awareness, retargeting, lead generation, conversion\n\n\n\n\nAppearance\n\n\t\n\nSponsored content, social media ads, in-feed units\n\n\t\n\nBanners, pop-ups, interstitials, rich media\n\n\n\n\nBlending\n\n\t\n\nBlends in with the content\n\n\t\n\nStands out from the content\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\t\n\nA travel website article recommending a “5 Must-See Places in Hawaii” list sponsored by a resort\n\n\t\n\nAn automobile company promoting their newly launched car on a news site\n\n\n\n\nClick-through rate (CTR)\n\n\t\n\nHigh\n\n\t\n\nLow\n\n\n\n\nUser experience\n\n\t\n\nLess intrusive and feels like a soft sell\n\n\t\n\nMore intrusive and comes across as a hard sell\n\nNow, let’s get into the details.\n\nNative Ads\n\nNative ads mostly appear on social media feeds, SERPs, news or publishing sites, and video platforms. \n\nThey help you:\n\nPromote content: Place your content in front of a larger, relevant audience. And amplify its reach.\nDrive engagement: Encourage the audience to engage with and share your promoted content\nBuild trust: Establish your brand as a source of quality information. By providing valuable, informative, or entertaining content through native ads.\n\nIn the online advertising world, native ads can be hard to spot. And you’ll typically consume them like you would regular content.\n\nFor example, this ad for fashion brand Djerf Avenue blends with the surrounding content on Pinterest. You only know it’s an ad from the “Promoted by” label. \n\nThanks to their ability to blend into platforms, native ads tend to get more clicks than display ads.\n\nDisplay Ads\n\nDisplay ads are visual advertisements that appear on websites, apps, and social media platforms. They come in various sizes and formats. Like banners, interstitials, and pop-ups.\n\nDisplay ads can use a combination of text, images, videos, and graphics.\n\nUnlike native ads, they’re designed to grab the audience’s attention. But they also tend to be more intrusive than native ads. \n\nHere’s an example: \n\nElastic, a search analytics platform, uses banner advertising to promote its product on Fortune. \n\nThe ad is at the top of the screen, making it hard to miss. And features a bold headline.\n\nDisplay ads help you:\n\nIncrease brand visibility: Reach a large audience\nReach potential customers: Target your ads to the people most interested in your offerings\nGenerate leads: Promote lead magnets like tools, gated content, free trials, and webinars\nBoost conversions: Retarget users who previously showed interest in your product or interacted with your website or social accounts. And convert them into paying customers.\n\nFor example, see how Adobe promotes its free trial of Acrobat Pro DC on Search Engine Journal in the image below? This is a perfect example of using display ads for lead generation.\n\nAnd GoDaddy is using ads to drive conversions.\n\nNote\n\nDisplay and native ads serve different purposes. So, consider using both as part of your marketing strategy. To leverage the strengths of each ad format to optimize your marketing performance.\n\nBenefits of Native Advertising\n\nNative ads’ benefits go beyond better performance for advertisers. They also improve the overall experience for the audience. \n\nHere are some specific benefits:\n\nLess intrusive: Native ads don’t interrupt users’ flow. This can enhance user satisfaction and loyalty to the platform.\nHigher engagement rates: Native ads often feature content that aligns with the audience's interests. And because they feel less like ads, they can garner more engagement.\nReduced ad blindness: Thanks to its subtle approach, native advertising helps combat people’s tendency to subconsciously ignore ads. So your audience doesn’t tire of seeing your ads. \nTargeted reach: Native ads enable you to target audiences based on demographics, interests, and more. Which could result in more conversions.\nImproved brand awareness: Even if users don't click a native ad, they might still notice your brand, logo, or product. This builds familiarity to help them recall your brand when they're ready to buy.\n5 Popular Native Ad Types \nIn-Feed/In-Content Native Ads\n\nIn-feed and in-content ad units both match the style of the surrounding content. And differ only in placement:\n\nIn-feed ads appear in content feeds. Like news or social media feeds.\nIn-content ads appear within a single piece of content. Such as a news article.\n\nLet’s look at some examples of in-feed native ads.\n\nHere’s how Atlassian promoted industry recognition on the Google Discover feed. \n\nIt looks just like a regular article. But it’s really an in-feed native ad. \n\nNative video ads are another popular in-feed advertising format that many brands use.\n\nFor instance, this native video ad from Aramco on X (formerly Twitter) looks like a regular corporate branding video about women's golf. But it’s an advertisement. \n\nNotice the “Ad” label in the top-right corner.\n\nTip\n\nUse Semrush’s audience research tool One2Target to analyze your target market’s online behavior. And reach them on their preferred channels with the kind of ads they prefer. \n\nContent Recommendation Ads\n\nContent recommendation ads (also known as content recommendation widgets or sponsored content ads) help you promote content assets. Like blog posts, articles, videos, product pages, landing pages, and more. \n\nYou can usually find them at the bottom of articles or in a webpage’s sidebars. With labels like:\n\n“Recommended for You” \n“You Might Also Like” \n“Sponsored”\n“Recommended Content”\n\nAdvertising platforms like Outbrain, Taboola, and RevContent help you reach audiences across various publisher platforms by automatically showing relevant content recommendations. Based on content consumption preferences and behavior across websites. \n\nHere’s an example of multiple content recommendation ads on Newsweek’s website.\n\nBranded Content\n\nBranded content is paid editorial content. It looks like a regular article or video on a website but a brand pays for it as a part of an advertising deal with a publisher. \n\nThis native ad type helps you reach a wider yet targeted audience by partnering with top publications.\n\nFor example, sustainable footwear brand Allbirds collaborated with the New York Times to publish branded content as a native ad. \n\nWhile it reads like a regular article, it's a paid post by Allbirds.\n\nDone well, this ad format can provide the same value the organic content does. And may even get similar engagement.\n\nSo, collaborate with the publisher’s creative and editorial teams to ensure branded content matches the site. Or work with a marketing agency. \n\nFurther reading: Sponsored Content: The Ultimate Guide with Inspiring Examples\n\nPaid Search Ads\n\nPaid search advertising allows you to display your ads on search engines like Google and Bing.\n\nThese ads look similar to organic results. But they’re labeled “Sponsored” or “Ad.”\n\nLike this:\n\nThese ads are a type of pay-per-click (PPC) ad.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nYou bid on keywords and phrases relevant to your business. And when users’ search queries include those keywords, your ad can be shown to them in search results.\n\nUse our Keyword Magic Tool to find relevant keywords for your ad campaigns. You’ll get thousands of keyword ideas. And the average cost per click (CPC)—the average amount advertisers are willing to spend for a click on their ads. \n\nPerform Keyword Research for Native Ads\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nPromoted Listings\n\nPromoted listings are product ads that appear on ecommerce marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy. And you can use these ads to increase visibility and drive sales. \n\nLike other native ads, promoted products blend with regular product listings. And mimic the appearance of the ecommerce platform.\n\nBut they’re marked “Sponsored,” so shoppers know they’re seeing advertised products.\n\nHere’s what promoted listings look like on Amazon:\n\nFurther reading: Product Listing Ads: What They Are and How to Use Them\n\nHow to Get Started with Native Advertising\n1. Define Your Native Ad Campaign Goals\n\nStart by clearly outlining your native advertising goals. Which will help you decide the right ad platforms, formats, and budgets for your campaigns.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf your goal is to generate leads for your professional services, you might opt for in-feed ads or sponsored content on platforms like LinkedIn, X, or Quora\nIf you want to drive sales for physical products, promoted listings on top ecommerce marketplaces can work well\n\nNext, ensure your goals are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). \n\nSay you want to increase sales for your T-shirt business. \n\nUsing the SMART framework, this same goal would look something like this: “Increase T-shirt sales by 10% in the next three months using promoted listings.” \n\nSpecific: Mentions increasing T-shirt sales by 10% using promoted listings\nMeasurable: Specifies a 10% sales increase serves as a performance measurement metric \nActionable: Clarifies that promoted listings are the method to achieve sales growth\nRelevant: Alludes to the fact that increasing sales of a product directly impacts business objectives\nTime-bound: Includes a specific three-month time range for completion\n2. Know Your Target Audience\n\nNative ad campaign success largely depends on how well you know your target audience. Because it helps you ensure your ads are reaching the right people and that you’re using your budget efficiently.\n\nHere are some key questions to help you understand your target audience:\n\nWho are my current customers? Analyze demographic and socioeconomic data like age, gender, income level, and education. And research overlapping interests to identify ad topics that will resonate with them.\nWhat problems does my product or service solve? Find out who is most affected by the issues your product or service addresses. To effectively position your product as an ideal solution. \nWhere does my target audience spend their time online? Track preferred social media platforms, websites, and forums. This helps you effectively place your ads.\nHow does my target audience consume content? Find out whether they prefer video, text, audio, or images. Check when they’ll most likely consume (and engage with) content.\n\nTo find the above information, conduct market research using customer interviews and surveys and analytics tools like Google Analytics (note this will only provide insight into your current website visitors).\n\nTo gain deeper insights on your target audience, use Semrush’s One2Target tool.\n\nOpen the tool, enter three to five competing domains, and click “Analyze.”\n\nIn the “Demographics” tab, you’ll see: \n\nHow the audience is distributed across age groups and gender for each competitor\nThe number of unique visitors for each domain\nThe countries each domain’s site visitors are from\n\nThen, head to the “Socioeconomics” tab to learn about household size, income level, etc.\n\nNow, click the “Behavior” tab. To learn about your audience’s content consumption patterns and interests. And the social media channels and devices they use.\n\nHit “Export” to save this data. And refer to it while planning your native ad campaigns. \n\nFor example, use the audience’s online behavior data to choose the most effective ad platforms and formats. And reference the demographic information to create highly relevant ads.\n\nThis can help increase your campaign’s engagement and conversion rates.\n\nStreamline Audience Research for Better Native Ads\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\n3. Choose the Right Native Advertising Platform\n\nNow, think carefully about which platform(s) are best for your ads. Because the choice of platform can play a huge role in performance.\n\nThese key factors can help you choose the right native ad platform(s):\n\nAudience: Consider what you discover about your audience. To assess whether the platform can effectively target your customers. \nCampaign goals: If your goal is lead generation, consider networks specializing in lead capture forms within native ads. And for sales-related goals, platforms with strong ecommerce integrations might be a good fit.\nPlatform features and ease of use: Is the platform's interface user-friendly for managing ad campaigns? Does the platform offer detailed reporting that allows you to effectively measure performance?\nCustomer service: Will you have access to customer support if needed?\n\nBegin with one or two platforms. And test your campaigns before scaling up.\n\nHere's a breakdown of native ad platform options:\n\nContent Recommendation Networks\n\nThese platforms help you reach audiences across diverse websites using in-feed ads and content recommendation widgets.\n\nHere are a few you can choose from:\n\nOutbrain\nRevContent \nTaboola\nSocial Media Platforms\n\nSocial media platforms allow you to use targeting options and promoted post formats to drive engagement.\n\nSome of your options are: \n\nFacebook\nInstagram\nX\nLinkedIn\n\nTo ensure you're making the best choice, leverage tools like Social Analytics from Semrush Social. \n\nThis app provides detailed insights into your social media performance and audience preferences on Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. This helps you understand which platforms work best for your native advertising campaigns.\n\nUncover Which Social Media Platforms Drive Your Native Advertising Success\n\nwith Semrush Social\n\nGet Now →\nSearch Engines\n\nSearch ads give you the opportunity to run native ads within search results. And target users based on search queries.\n\nHere are two options:\n\nGoogle Ads\nMicrosoft (Bing) Advertising\nDemand-Side Platforms (DSPs)\n\nDemand-side platforms provide access to a wide range of native ad networks and publishers. These platforms are often suited for larger budgets. And technical expertise.\n\nThese are a few potential choices:\n\nThe Trade Desk\nNexxen\nMediaMath\n4. Set a Budget for Your Ad Campaign\n\nWhen deciding your campaign budget, consider these factors: \n\nCampaign goals\nScope (or duration)\nAverage costs\nConversion rate\n\nWhile setting goals and scope is an internal decision, you'll need to research average advertising costs and conversion rates. \n\nFor example, WordStream publishes an advertising benchmark report every year. And it includes information about cost per click, click-through rate, and conversion rate. \n\nAnd ad platforms like Google Ads and LinkedIn Ads provide benchmarking tools. To help you find data related to your industry and location.\n\nHere’s an example that explains how to define your campaign budget:\n\nLet’s say your goal is to generate 100 new leads every month using PPC search ads on Google.\n\nThe average CPC in your industry is $2.50. So, you can assume that it’ll cost you roughly $2.50 each time a user clicks your ad.\n\nAnd the benchmark conversion rate is 2%. \n\nThis means you'll need approximately 5,000 clicks to generate 100 leads (100 / 0.02 = 5,000).\n\nSo, your estimated monthly budget would be $12,500 for this campaign (5,000 x $2.50 = $12,500).\n\nPro tip\n\nStart with a small budget for testing. This allows you to collect data, assess performance, and adjust your spending before going all in.\n\n5. Create High-Quality Content for Your Native Ads\n\nAd copy and design can make or break your campaigns. So, it’s crucial that your native ads are created to convey value and drive engagement.\n\nFollow these best practices:\n\nMatch your content to your audience’s interests. Show/explain how your product or service can solve their pain points. \nProvide value—information, education, and/or entertainment—through your native ads. Your audience will likely be turned off by overt sales pitches. \nChoose an ad design that complements the platform for a seamless user experience\nEnsure your chosen platform follows the ethical practices of native advertising to maintain audience trust. For example, check if the publisher clearly marks native ads as “Sponsored” or “Promoted Content.”\n\nIf you’ve opted to run search ads, study your competition for inspiration using our Advertising Research tool. \n\nEnter a competitor's website. And hit “Search.”\n\nSelect the “Ad Copies” report from the top menu. \n\nNow, you’ll see your competitors’ ad copy. Including keywords they’re targeting. \n\nLike this:\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Search Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n6. Monitor Your Native Ad Campaign’s Performance\n\nContinuously test and measure your native ad performance. So you can gain insights on what resonates with your audience and optimize accordingly. \n\nWe recommend tracking these metrics (many platforms have built-in analytics dashboards to track these):\n\nEngagement: The number of user interactions with your ad (likes, comments, shares, video views, etc.)\nImpressions: The number of times your ad is displayed to users \nClick-through rate (CTR): The percentage of people who click on your ad after seeing it\nCost per click (CPC): The amount you pay each time someone clicks on your ad\nConversion rate: The percentage of users who take the desired action out of the total number of people who click on your ad. Like completing a purchase or signing up for a webinar. \nCost per acquisition (CPA): The cost to acquire a new customer\nReturn on ad spend (ROAS): The amount of revenue you earn for every dollar you spend on advertising\n\nAnd consider adding UTM parameters (tracking codes) to your native ads’ URLs. To monitor the traffic and conversions from native ads in Google Analytics.\n\nImprove Your Engagement and ROI with Native Ads\n\nNative advertising isn’t about tricking your audience to click your ads. \n\nIt’s about connecting with them authentically, fostering engagement, and building trust.\n\nAnd you can do just that with tools like One2Target, Advertising Research and Social Analytics.\n\nGet started with a free trial of Semrush.\n\nElevate Your Native Ad Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
