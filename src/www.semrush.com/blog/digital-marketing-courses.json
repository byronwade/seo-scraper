SEO Principles: An Essential Guide for Beginners (Semrush Academy)\n\nCost: Free\n\nLength: 1 hour and 40 minutes\n\nPerfect for: Beginner digital marketers or anyone looking for a refresher on SEO fundamentals\n\nLearn the foundations of SEO from our very own Director of Growth Marketing, Kyle Byers, in this free digital marketing course from Semrush Academy.\n\nUsing 15 years of hands-on experience, Byers breaks down topics like keyword research, technical SEO, and techniques for improving website visibility. \n\nHe shares everything you need to know about SEO—and nothing you don’t.\n\nNote\n\nAll Semrush Academy courses include a certification exam. If you pass, you’ll receive a certificate of completion to add to your resume and LinkedIn. \n\n2. SEO for Beginners (Yoast SEO Academy)\n\nCost: Free\n\nLength: 2 hours\n\nPerfect for: Marketers and entrepreneurs who want to learn SEO basics\n\nYoast’s free digital marketing course also breaks down the fundamentals of SEO. But focuses primarily on optimizing WordPress websites (which account for 43.2% of all sites out there).\n\nThe two-hour course includes 20 short videos on SEO basics and slightly advanced topics like site structure, crawlability, and page speed optimization.\n\n3. SEO Training Certification (HubSpot Academy)\n\nCost: Free\n\nLength: Around 4 hours\n\nPerfect for: Marketing generalists who want to understand SEO\n\nHubSpot’s SEO Training Certification course offers marketers a quick, credible way to prove their understanding of basic SEO principles. \n\nThe course includes six lessons that are broken down into 26 videos and five quizzes.

Technical SEO (Semrush Academy)\n\nCost: Free\n\nLength: Around 3 hours\n\nPerfect for: Marketers who want to understand technical SEO\n\nMany online digital marketing courses skim over the basics of technical SEO.
