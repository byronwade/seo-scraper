  "content": "Every page on your website likely uses JavaScript.\n\nIf you use Google Analytics, event tracking, or display ads, you’re already using JavaScript.\n\nBut you can (and should) leverage it further to create great experiences for your users. Before you can do that, you need to understand what JavaScript is and what it’s used for.\n\nWhat Is JavaScript?\n\nJavaScript (JS) is a computer programming language used to make websites and applications dynamic and interactive.\n\nIt’s unique because it can run directly in your browser, not just on a server.\n\nAlong with hypertext markup language (HTML) and cascading style sheets (CSS), JavaScript is one of the most commonly used programming languages of the internet.\n\nIn fact, 98.4% of all websites use JavaScript as of March 2023.\n\nJavaScript, CSS, and HTML work together to make up the user-facing elements of most websites and online applications.\n\nThink of these coding languages as the components of a house:\n\nHTML is the foundation of the house. It provides the basic layout, structure, and content of a website.\nCSS is the interior design. It provides design, fonts, colors, effects, and other visual elements. \nJavaScript is the electrical and plumbing systems. JS brings dynamism and interactivity to the website. For example, pop-ups, animations, video and social media embeds, drop-down menus, and many other website components are created using JavaScript.\n\nWithout JavaScript, webpages would be mostly static and boring.\n\nJavaScript adds behavior and interactivity. But it can do so much more.\n\nHistory of JavaScript\n\nBrendan Eich developed JavaScript in 1995 while working for Netscape.\n\nNetscape sought to develop a scripting language that could help make early versions of the World Wide Web more dynamic.\n\nJavaScript quickly gained popularity as developers realized its ability to add dynamism and interactivity to webpages. \n\nIn 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA International), an organization that aims to standardize the use of information technology systems.\n\nThis led to the creation of the ECMAScript standard, the formal specifications for JavaScript. \n\nIts growing popularity has facilitated the development of libraries and frameworks, dedicated JS engines such as V8 (which powers Chrome), and server-side environments.\n\nDespite similarities in name, JavaScript is entirely different from Java.\n\nLibraries vs. Frameworks\n\nLibraries are collections of prewritten code that can be used to easily implement frequently used JavaScript tasks.\n\nLibraries lead to faster development because developers don’t need to write every line of code.\n\nFrameworks are collections of libraries.\n\nThink of libraries as tools. And frameworks as fully loaded toolboxes.\n\nAlthough a library can provide code for a specific function on your website, a framework can provide all the code you need to build the website. \n\nCommon JavaScript libraries include jQuery and React. Common JavaScript frameworks include Vue.js, Node.js, and Angular.\n\nWhat Is JavaScript Used For?\n\nJavaScript is used to make dynamic websites, web and mobile apps, games, web servers, back-end infrastructures, and more.\n\nThe following are the most common uses of JavaScript.\n\nWeb Development\n\nJavaScript is most commonly used to create dynamic, interactive websites. \n\nDevelopers use JS to add animations, pop-up windows, search bars, buttons, audio and video, chat widgets, and other interactive elements to a webpage.\n\nYou can also use JS to provide real-time updates to a page without reloading it.\n\nFor example, websites with news tickers, stock or crypto prices, or real-time product availability information typically use JavaScript to add this functionality.\n\nThe front end (user-facing side) of many common websites is built almost entirely on JavaScript, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia. \n\nWeb-Based Games and Applications\n\nJavaScript is used to make most games and applications on the internet. \n\nBecause it runs directly in the browser, JS allows users to play games and run applications without downloading additional software.\n\nAnd because JavaScript is compiled into machine code as it’s executed (referred to as just-in-time compilation), simple functions and processes are performed quickly.\n\nThis results in lots of dynamic, interactive utility. \n\nOther languages, such as C and C++, use ahead-of-time compilation. This means the language is compiled into simpler machine code before it’s executed. \n\nEspecially for simpler functions and processes, ahead-of-time compilation can be slower.\n\nWith JavaScript, developers can create anything from simple arcade-style games to robust multiplayer games.\n\nAdditionally, interactive applications like image editors, project management tools, chatbots such as ChatGPT, and calculators all use JavaScript. \n\nEven real-time communication applications, such as Google Meet, Zoom, and Slack, can function in-browser because of JS.\n\nServer-Side Programming\n\nServer-side programming refers to code that runs on a web server to handle requests from clients (such as web browsers) and return responses.\n\nThis allows developers to build fast and scalable web applications, interact with databases, build application programming interfaces (APIs), and facilitate real-time communication. \n\nFor example, server-side programming is what allows for dynamic pages like Facebook’s newsfeed. \n\nIf each post, story, and status update were built on individual static pages, it would be extremely inefficient and require millions of pages. \n\nInstead, Facebook uses basic HTML and CSS templates that are dynamically updated with JavaScript as new information comes in. \n\nThe same concept applies to ecommerce websites like Amazon. \n\nAmazon search results and store pages are dynamically updated using JavaScript as items sell out and others are added.\n\nMobile App Development\n\nJavaScript frameworks, such as React Native, Ionic, NativeScript, and Apache Cordova, enable developers to build native and hybrid mobile apps for Android and iOS.\n\nFacebook, Google, Uber, and Instagram all use JavaScript to build their mobile apps. \n\nJS is fast, efficient, and straightforward. And due to the popularity of the programming language, JavaScript developers are easy to find.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nIn recent years, developers have used JavaScript to build applications and systems that leverage artificial intelligence.\n\nYou can use JS libraries such as TensorFlow.js and Brain.js to build and train machine learning models for sentiment analysis and recommendation systems. \n\nOther libraries can be used to process and analyze human language for natural language processing (NLP) systems. \n\nEven chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are built using JavaScript.\n\nHow Is JavaScript Different from Other Programming Languages?\n\nJavaScript differs from other programming languages in the following ways:\n\nIt’s an Interpreted Language\n\nThis means it can be executed directly in a browser.\n\nOther languages, like C, C++, and Java, are compiled languages and need to be translated into machine code before they can be executed.\n\nIt Uses Dynamic Typing\n\nDynamic typing means variable types are associated with runtime values, not named or declared fields. \n\nThis allows developers to write code faster, as they don’t have to worry about specifying variable types. \n\nFor example, a developer could assign the variable “a” the value of 100. The compiler will infer at runtime that “a” represents an integer. \n\nHowever, this also means variable types could be misinterpreted as they are run. This can cause bugs and errors.\n\nIt’s Primarily Used in Client-Side Execution\n\nJavaScript is unique in that it’s most commonly run in the user’s web browser. Not on a server.\n\nThis means JavaScript can interact with the user, respond to user inputs, and dynamically update the content of the page without needing to communicate with a server. \n\nOther major languages, such as PHP and Ruby, are primarily used server-side. \n\nIt’s Ubiquitous\n\nUnlike many computer programming languages that are confined to a handful of specific use cases, JavaScript is becoming a general-purpose language.\n\nIt’s supported by all major browsers.\n\nIt can be used both client-side and server-side.\n\nAnd it can be used to develop websites, mobile apps, and software. \n\nWhat Are the Advantages and Limitations of JavaScript?\n\nWe’ve outlined the advantages and limitations of JavaScript below.\n\nAdvantages\n\nThere are numerous advantages to using JavaScript:\n\nIt’s relatively easy to learn and use\nIt can be used for client-side and server-side, front end and back end\nIt provides dynamism and interactivity on websites\nDue to its popularity, there are many helpful resources available\nIt runs on multiple platforms and devices\nIt allows for cross-platform compatibility\nIt’s supported by all major web browsers\nThere are many libraries, frameworks, and APIs available to facilitate tasks\nIt’s fast for client-side and simple tasks\nIt works well in concert with other programming languages\nLimitations\n\nThere are disadvantages and limitations of using JavaScript:\n\nIt can be slow for computationally heavy tasks\nIt comes with inherent security concerns due to access to the client's browser\nBugs can be difficult to find and resolve\nErrors can prevent JavaScript from rendering on a website\nToo much JavaScript may cause website loading and performance issues\nCrawlers may have trouble crawling and analyzing JS content\nBrowsers interpret JS differently, which creates varying experiences\nHow Does JavaScript Affect Site Performance?\n\nImplementing JavaScript on your website will negatively affect its performance.\n\nBut when you use JS appropriately and in moderation, the benefits can counter the negative effects on performance.\n\nThe more code and scripts on your page, the worse the page will perform. \n\nYour user’s browser has to download, parse, and execute each JS script in order of HTML appearance. \n\nThis includes scripts such as Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Google Ads, ImpactHero, and even web fonts.\n\nVisual components such as image carousels and video embeds can also increase page loading time.\n\nComplex themes and plugins will also negatively affect your site performance.\n\nBy default, JavaScript parsing and execution takes place on the main thread. Think of the main thread as a queue of tasks to be completed in order. \n\nIf you have too many JavaScript tasks on the main thread, it could delay the loading of other content or images.\n\nIf important on-page elements, such as your content, load too slowly, it can negatively affect the user experience and cause them to bounce. \n\nThis can hurt your SEO efforts, your traffic, and, ultimately, your business.\n\nAdditionally, not everyone has high-performance devices and high-speed internet connections.\n\nAlthough pages may load quickly on your computer, they may not on your users’ devices. \n\nJavaScript affects site performance, but why does that matter?\n\nUser Experience\n\nAdding dynamism and interactivity to your webpages will improve user experience, but adding too much can have the opposite effect. \n\nToo much JavaScript causes your site to load slowly—if at all.\n\nPeople don’t like waiting. Especially on the internet.\n\nIf your site takes too long to load, users may be frustrated, hit the back button, and leave for your competitors’ sites.\n\nThis is bad for business. And bad for your search ranking, too.\n\nCore Web Vitals\n\nCore Web Vitals are another important consideration when evaluating your JavaScript use and website performance.\n\nCore Web Vitals are metrics Google developed to analyze a website’s performance and the experience it provides. \n\nThese metrics affect your search ranking. It’s important to monitor them and ensure your JavaScript isn’t causing issues. \n\nTools like Semrush’s Site Audit and Google Search Console can identify JS-related issues on your webpages. \n\nHow to Use JavaScript on Your Website\n\nIf you’re one of the few websites on the internet not using JavaScript, you can add it two ways:\n\nEmbedding\n\nYou can add JavaScript code to your website by placing it directly into the <head> of your webpage’s HTML source code.\n\nThe JS code must be enclosed in script tags, as shown below:\n\nLinking\n\nYou can also add JavaScript to your website by linking to an existing JS file.\n\nThis is useful when you want to add the same code to multiple pages.\n\nIt’s also useful when you have lots of code to add to the page.\n\nInstead of adding hundreds of lines of JavaScript to your HTML source code, you can simply link to a separate file. \n\nRegardless of the method you choose, you must ensure the code is enclosed in script tags on every page you want it to work on.\n\nHow to Learn JavaScript\n\nTo get the most out of your site with JavaScript, you’ll need to take your education beyond the what and the why. \n\nWe recommend the following resources and tutorials to get started:\n\nThe Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!\nW3Schools’s JavaScript Tutorial\nCodeacademy’s Free JavaScript Course\nJavaScript SEO: An In-Depth Guide\nJavaScript Cheat Sheet (with Table & Downloadable PDF)\nJavaScript Issues and How to Solve Them\n\nThe possibilities are almost endless when it comes to what you can do with JavaScript on your website.\n\nHowever, to make the most of it, you must ensure your code is as polished as possible. \n\nSemrush’s Site Audit tool can help ensure your JavaScript is optimized and not hindering your page performance. \n\nUnminified JavaScript\n\nFor JavaScript to work efficiently and minimize negative page performance effects, the code must be minified.\n\nUnminified JavaScript contains unnecessary lines and spaces.\n\nRemoving these lines and spaces can improve page load time without sacrificing content or functionality.\n\nThe Site Audit tool can identify where on your website JavaScript needs to be minified.\n\nFirst Input Delay\n\nFirst Input Delay (FID) refers to the time it takes for the browser to respond after a user first interacts with your website (e.g., clicks a link).\n\nFID is one of the most important Core Web Vitals. And it can affect your search engine ranking.\n\nIf you have FID issues on your website, JavaScript is a frequent and likely culprit.\n\nLuckily, the Site Audit tool can identify First Input Delay problems and what’s causing them.\n\nBalance Is Key\n\nJavaScript can help you provide an unforgettable experience for your users.\n\nBut it can also easily cause site performance issues.\n\nBalance is key.\n\nStrike a balance between user experience and performance to optimize your website.\n\nFortunately, the powerful tools available in Semrush's Site Audit can help you find this balance and solve issues.\n\nJavaScript FAQs\n\nHere are some frequently asked questions and answers about JavaScript:\n\nWhat Is JavaScript and Why Is It used?\n\nJavaScript is a computer programming language commonly used to add dynamism and interactivity to webpages. It can also be used to create mobile applications and software.\n\nDevelopers use JavaScript because it’s easy to learn and use. It can also be used across multiple platforms and devices.\n\nWhat Is JavaScript in Simple Words?\n\nJavaScript is a computer programming language used to make websites more interactive.\n\nWhat Is an Example of JavaScript?\n\nAn example of JavaScript is the code you place on your website to install Google Analytics.\n\nOther examples include drop-down menus, interactive calendars, audio and video embeds, interactive maps, image carousels, and display ads.\n\nIs JavaScript a Programming Language?\n\nYes, JavaScript is a programming or scripting language typically used to make websites more dynamic and interactive.\n\nAre Java and JavaScript the Same?\n\nNo, Java and JavaScript are not the same. They are two distinct languages with different uses and purposes. \n\nJavaScript was originally called LiveScript, but its name was changed before its official release. This was likely in an effort to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.",
