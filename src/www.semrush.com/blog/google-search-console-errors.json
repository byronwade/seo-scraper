  "content": "Google Search Console is a web service that lets you monitor and manage your website's presence in Google Search results.\n\nIt also helps you identify potentially impactful website errors. Here’s what you need to know about these errors and how to fix them.\n\nPro tip\n\nFind and fix Google Search Console errors and much more with the Site Audit tool.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry It Free →\nUnderstanding Google Search Console Errors\n\nIf Googlebot comes across issues when it crawls your site, those issues may be flagged for you as errors in Google Search Console.\n\nThese issues are important to review. \n\nWhy? \n\nFor one, they can negatively impact your site's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nFor example, unresolved errors can prevent Google from properly indexing your website. Unindexed pages won’t show up in search results.\n\nUnresolved website errors can also negatively impact user experience. This is bad for visitors. And it’s a key ranking factor for Google, so poor performance in this area can cause Google to rank you lower in search results, too.\n\nLet’s take a look at how to fix Google Search Console errors.\n\nTypes of Google Search Console Errors and How to Fix Them\nStatus Code Errors\n\nStatus code errors in Google Search Console relate to the HTTP status codes returned when Googlebot attempts to crawl your webpages.\n\nHTTP status codes are relayed every time a site loads. When a user types in a URL or a bot visits the site, a request is sent to that site’s server. The server responds with an HTTP status code that tells the browser—or bot—more about that page. \n\nThe HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers. For example, “200,” “301,” or “404.”\n\nDifferent status codes convey different information about the success or failure of a request. \n\nFor example, the status code “200” signals that everything is good and the page can be accessed as expected.\n\nHowever, some status codes indicate there were problems accessing the webpage. These show up as errors in Google Search Console. Because they can negatively impact the ability of crawlers and users to access your site.\n\nTo see if you have any status code errors, open Google Search Console and click on “Pages” in the left-hand menu.\n\nYou’ll see a breakdown of the pages on your website according to whether they are “indexed” or “not indexed.”\n\nIt’s possible some pages haven’t been indexed due to a status code error.\n\nTo see if that’s the case, scroll down to the bottom of the report. You’ll see a table with the title “Why pages aren’t indexed.”\n\nIf there are any status errors, you’ll see one of the following under “Reason”:\n\nServer Error (5xx)\nNot found (404)\nUnauthorized request (401)\nSoft 404\nRedirect error (3xx)\n\nLet’s review what the different status code errors mean and how to fix them.\n\nServer Errors (5xx)\n\nA three-number status code beginning with “5” reflects a server error. This indicates a problem with the server hosting your website.\n\nHere’s what a server error looks like in Google Search Console:\n\nCommon causes of a 5xx status include:\n\nProgramming errors: Bugs or coding errors in the server-side scripts (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby) that power your website\nServer configuration issues: Misconfigurations in the server settings or the web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx)\nResource exhaustion: If the server runs out of resources (such as memory or processing power), it may struggle to handle requests, leading to internal server errors\nDatabase issues: Problems with the database that your website relies on, such as connection issues or database server errors, can trigger a 5xx error\nHow to Fix a Server Error (5xx) in Google Search Console\nReview recent changes. If the error started occurring after recent updates or changes to your website, consider rolling back those changes to see if the issue resolves.\nContact your hosting provider. If you're not sure how to resolve the server error or if it's related to the server infrastructure, contact your hosting provider for assistance. They may be able to identify and fix the problem.\nTest server resources. Ensure that your server has sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to handle the traffic and requests to your website. Consider upgrading your hosting plan if necessary.\n\nOnce you've identified and resolved the underlying cause of the 5xx server error, use Google Search Console to request a recrawl of the affected pages.\n\nYou do this by entering the affected URL into the search box at the top of Google Search Console:\n\nThen click “REQUEST INDEXING”:\n\nThis asks Googlebot to revisit the pages and update its index with the corrected information. \n\nNot Found (404) Errors\n\nThe \"404 Not Found\" error is a standard HTTP response code that’s returned when a server can’t find the content associated with the requested URL.\n\nIn the context of Google Search Console, it means Googlebot tried to crawl a page on your site, but the server returned a 404 error because it couldn’t find the page’s content.\n\nHere are some common reasons why a 404 error might occur:\n\nPage deletion or removal: If you intentionally deleted a page or removed it from your website and Googlebot attempts to crawl that page, the server will return a 404 error\nURL changes without proper redirects: If you've changed the URL structure of your website without implementing proper redirects (e.g. 301 redirects), the old URLs may result in 404 errors\nTypo or mistyped URL: It's possible that there was a typo or a mistake in the URL provided to Googlebot. Ensure the URLs in your sitemap and internal links are correct and lead to existing pages.\nHow to Find 404 Errors in Google Search Console\n\nOpen Google Search Console and click on the “Pages” report.\n\nScroll down to see “Why pages aren’t indexed.” Here, you’ll be able to see if any pages have a 404 error.\n\nHow to Fix a 404 Error in Google Search Console\nImplement 301 redirects. If you've deliberately and permanently moved a page to a new location, use301 redirects to point the old URL to the new one.\nUpdate internal links. If there are links within your website to deleted pages, update those links to point to valid URLs. You can find these links using Site Audit from Semrush.\nCheck external links. If external websites are linking to non-existent pages on your site, consider reaching out to those sites and requesting that they update their links.\nSubmit a sitemap. Ensure that your website's sitemap is up to date and accurately reflects the current structure of your site. Then submit the sitemap to Google Search Console.\nUnauthorized Request Errors (401)\n\nAn error with the HTTP status code \"401\" in Google Search Console indicates that a request was \"unauthorized.\"\n\nImage Source: Onely\n\n401 errors appear when:\n\nThe page contains password-protected content, meaning Googlebot and other crawlers can’t access the page\nThere are IP-blocking or access restrictions preventing Googlebot’s IP addresses from accessing the page\nCrawler-specific configuration issues have accidentally been set up\nHow to Fix a 401 Unauthorized Error in Google Search Console\nCheck authentication settings. If the page requires authentication (for example, you need to log in to view the content), review the authentication settings to make sure they’re correctly configured.\nTest access. Manually test access to the affected pages by attempting to access them through a web browser or using tools like the Fetch as Google feature in Google Search Console. This can help identify any issues with access.\nReview access restrictions. Check for any IP-blocking or access restrictions on your server or website. Ensure that Googlebot's IP addresses are not blocked and the necessary permissions are in place for crawling.\nVerify user agent access. Confirm that your website's configuration allows access to common search engine user agents, including Googlebot. If there are rules limiting access to certain user agents, ensure that they are appropriately configured.\n\nAfter addressing the unauthorized access issue, use Google Search Console to request a recrawl of the affected pages.\n\nSoft 404 Errors\n\nSoft 404 errors in Google Search Console occur when a page looks like a normal page (returns a 200 status code) but the content or certain signals on the page indicate that it should be treated as if it doesn't exist.\n\nThis can be confusing for search engines like Google. And it can impact how your pages are indexed and displayed in search results. Google Search Console flags them as errors.\n\nCommon scenarios leading to soft 404 errors include:\n\nEmpty pages: Pages that are empty or contain very little content might trigger soft 404 errors. While the server returns a \"200 OK\" status code, the lack of content suggests the page isn’t providing meaningful information to users.\nRedirected pages: If a page is redirected to another URL, but the content on the destination URL is thin or not relevant, Google might interpret it as a soft 404\nCustom error pages: If your website has a custom error page showing the user an error message—even though it has a “200” OK” status code—this may trigger soft 404 errors\nHow to Fix a Soft 404 Error in Google Search Console\nReview page content. Examine the content of the pages flagged as soft 404 errors. Ensure that they provide meaningful information to users. If the content is insufficient, consider improving it or redirecting users to a more relevant page.\nVerify redirects. If a page is being redirected, make sure the destination URL contains relevant content. Avoid redirecting users to pages that don't relate to the content of the original page.\nCheck custom error pages. If your website uses custom error pages, ensure that they provide helpful information and are not mistaken for empty or irrelevant content. \nRedirect Errors\n\nRedirects send users and search engine crawlers from one URL to another. \n\nFor example, if a page no longer exists, you can place a redirect to automatically take visitors to a related page that does exist.\n\nRedirect errors occur when a redirect fails for some reason. These errors can negatively impact how search engines like Google crawl, index, and rank your website.\n\nCommon redirect errors include:\n\nRedirect chains: This is when one URL redirects to another, and then that second URL redirects to a third, forming a sequence of redirects. Redirect chains can slow down the loading of pages and negatively impact user experience and search engine crawling efficiency.\nRedirect loops: These happen when the final destination URL redirects back to a previous URL in the chain. This can cause an infinite loop of redirects, preventing the page from loading and leading to crawl errors.\nIncorrect redirects: If a page is redirected to an incorrect or irrelevant URL, it can lead to a redirect error. Redirects should be set up accurately and lead users and search engines to a relevant destination URL.\nHow to Fix a Redirect Error in Google Search Console\n\nIdentify any redirect errors in Google Search Console by visiting the “Pages” report. Scroll down to see “Why pages aren’t indexed.”\n\nAnalyze redirect chains. If redirect chains are identified, review and simplify them. Ideally, a redirect should lead directly to the final destination without unnecessary intermediary steps. \nFix redirect loops. If redirect loops are detected, identify the source of the loop and correct the redirect configurations to break the loop. Ensure that the final destination URL is correct.\nCheck redirect targets. Verify that the URLs to which pages are redirected are accurate and relevant. Incorrect redirects can confuse users and search engines.\nUpdate internal links. If you've changed URLs and implemented redirects, update internal links on your site to point directly to the new URLs, reducing the need for redirects.\nUse proper redirect status codes. When implementing redirects, use appropriate HTTP status codes. For example, a 301 redirect indicates a permanent move, while a 302 redirect signals a temporary move.\nCrawl and Indexation Issues\n\nCrawl and indexation issues happen when Google’s crawlers can’t reach a page they should be able to. Or when something’s stopping them from adding a page to their index.\n\nYou can check for these issues in the “Pages” report.\n\nOpen the report and scroll down to the table “Why pages aren’t indexed.”\n\nYou might encounter the following issues.\n\nBlocked by Robots.txt\n\nIf a page is blocked by robots.txt, this might be an issue. But only if you don’t want that page to be blocked. Some pages are blocked intentionally.\n\nRobots.txt is a file that sits on your website and contains instructions for search engine crawlers. It’s usually the first page they visit on your website.\n\nYou can include instructions in the robots.txt file to tell search bots not to crawl certain pages. For example, admin pages that aren’t accessible without a login.\n\nYou do this using a “disallow” directive.\n\nHowever, it’s possible a page can be blocked by robots.txt by mistake.\n\nIn Google Search Console, if you see a page that says “blocked by robots.txt,” but you want Google to crawl that page, you can edit the robots.txt file. Then, use Google Search Console to request a recrawl of the affected pages.\n\nHow to Fix Pages Blocked by Robots.txt\n\nYou can review and fix any issues with your robots.txt file using the Site Audit tool.\n\nOpen the tool and click “+ Create project.”\n\nEnter your website domain. If you like, you can also give the project a name.\n\nClick the “Create project” button.\n\nConfigure any additional settings you’d like for the site audit. Then click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nOnce the audit is complete, go to the \"Issues\" tab and search for \"robots.txt.\"\n\nClick on any issues related to your robots.txt file, such as \"Robots.txt file has format errors.\"\n\nA list of invalid lines in the file will be displayed. \n\nClick on \"Why and how to fix it\" to get specific instructions on how to resolve the error.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nUser Experience and Usability Issues\n\nWebsite issues that cause poor user experiences are troubling for two reasons. \n\nFirst, you don’t want visitors to your site to have poor experiences. It causes distrust in your brand. And it lowers the chances that person will interact with your content again. \n\nPoor user experiences are also bad because positive user experiences are an important ranking factor for Google Search. Pages with poor user experiences will not do as well in the search results. \n\nCore Web Vitals Issues\n\nCore Web Vitals are a set of user-centered metrics that measure the loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability of a page. \n\nEssentially, Core Web Vitals measure how fast and pleasant a website is to use.\n\nThe three main metrics are:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP): The time it takes for the largest content element (such as an image or a block of text) to become visible on the user’s screen\nInteraction to Next Paint (INP): How well the webpage responds to user interactions\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS): How many times the page shifts around as it loads\n\nGoogle Search Console flags when you have Core Web Vitals performance issues. \n\nYou can identify these issues using the Site Audit tool. And get tips on how to fix them.\n\nHow to Fix Core Web Vitals Issues\n\nOpen Site Audit. Either choose an existing project or click “+ Create project.” \n\nConfigure the settings and click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nIn a few minutes, you’ll see your results.\n\nIn the “Overview” report, you’ll see a widget on the right called “Core Web Vitals.” Click “View details.”\n\nYou’ll see your performance against Core Web Vitals metrics for 10 pages on your site. \n\nScroll down to “Metrics” and you can see the performance broken down into the three Core Web Vitals.\n\nUnderneath each one, there’s a list titled “Top improvements” with suggestions to improve your performance in that area.\n\nHTTPS Errors in Google Search Console\n\nGoogle favors sites with an SSL certificate. This is a security certificate that encrypts data sent between a website and a browser.\n\nOnce you have an SSL certificate, all pages on your website should begin with “https://.”\n\nAny pages starting instead with “http://” could indicate security issues to search engines. So it’s best to fix them when they appear.\n\nOpen Google Search Console and click “HTTPS” in the left-hand menu.\n\nThe table will show if you have any non-HTTPS URLs on your site.\n\nHow to Fix HTTPS Errors in Google Search Console\n\nIf you have HTTPS errors, scroll down on that HTTPS page in Google Search Console. You’ll see a table called “Why pages are not being served over HTTPS.”\n\nClick on the issue row to see which URLs are affected.\n\nOnce you see the list of URLs, you can remove any links to these pages from your website and ask Google Search Console to recrawl your site.\n\nManual Actions in Google Search Console\n\nManual actions in Google Search Console refer to penalties imposed on a website by human reviewers who work at Google. When these reviewers identify violations of Google's guidelines, they may take manual actions to penalize the site.\n\nManual actions are different to algorithmic penalties, which are automatically applied by Google's algorithms.\n\nCommon reasons for manual actions include:\n\nUnnatural linking: If a site is involved in link schemes, has purchased links, or participates in link exchanges that violate Google's guidelines, it may receive a manual action\nThin or duplicate content: Websites with low-quality or duplicate content may face manual actions for violating content quality guidelines\nCloaking or sneaky redirects: If a site shows different content to users and search engines or uses deceptive redirects, it may receive a manual action\nSpammy structured markup: Incorrect use of structured data markup (schema.org) to manipulate search results can lead to manual actions\nUser-generated spam: Websites that allow users to generate content (comments, forums) may face manual actions if they fail to moderate and control spam effectively \nHacked content: If a site is compromised and contains harmful or irrelevant content, Google may take manual action to protect users\n\nIf a manual action is imposed, you’ll be notified through Google Search Console.\n\nImage Source: Google\n\nThe notification will give you details about the issue. As well as guidance on how to fix it and steps for requesting a review after corrections are made.\n\nOnce you’ve fixed the issue, enter the issue in Google Search Console and click “Request review.”\n\nIf you’ve properly fixed the issue, the team at Google will mark it as resolved and penalties may be lifted.\n\nSecurity Issues in Google Search Console\n\nWhen security issues are identified, they can negatively impact your site's search visibility. Plus, Google may label your site as potentially harmful to users.\n\nThe Security Issues Report in Google Search Console provides information about potential security threats or issues detected on your website.\n\nCommon security issues reported in Google Search Console include:\n\nMalware infections: Google may detect malware on your site, indicating that it’s been compromised. And there’s malicious software that could harm visitors.\nHacked content: If your website has been hacked, attackers may inject unwanted content or links. Google will alert you if hacked content is detected.\nSocial engineering: Google identifies instances where your site may be involved in social engineering attacks, such as phishing or deceptive practices\nSteps to Address Security Issues:\n\nUse Google Search Console to view and fix any security issues. \n\nOpen Google Search Console. Navigate to the Security & Manual Actions section on the left-hand side of the screen. Click on “Security issues.”\n\nIf there are any flagged issues, you’ll see them here.\n\nGoogle will provide information about the type of security issues detected. As well as recommendations or actions to resolve the problems.\n\nIf malware or hacked content is detected, clean and secure your website. Remove any malicious code, update passwords, and implement additional security measures.\n\nAfter resolving the security issues, submit your site for a review through Google Search Console. Google will assess whether the issues have been adequately addressed.\n\nPreventing Google Search Console Errors\n\nFollow these best practices to stop Google Search Console errors from happening.\n\nRun regular site audits. Conduct regular audits of your website to identify and address technical issues promptly.\nKeep your XML sitemap up to date. Ensure your website has an XML sitemap that includes all relevant pages. Submit the sitemap to search engines via Google Search Console to facilitate crawling and indexing.\nOptimize your robots.txt file. Use a well-constructed robots.txt file to control which parts of your site should be crawled by search engines. Regularly review and update this file.\nMake sure you have a valid SSL certificate. Ensure your website has a valid SSL certificate, providing a secure connection (HTTPS). Google favors secure sites, and it positively impacts rankings.\nOptimize images. Optimize images for faster loading. Use descriptive file names and include alt text for accessibility and SEO.\nUse a strong URL structure. Keep URLs simple, descriptive, and user-friendly. Avoid using complex URL parameters when possible.\n\nSemrush tools help you stay on top of your website’s technical SEO performance. With them, you can catch issues before they escalate.\n\nUse Site Audit to learn about any current issues with your site. And how to fix them.\n\nPlus, you’ll receive automatic emails the moment a potential new issue arises.
