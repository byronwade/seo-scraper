But are your efforts yielding positive results?\n\nYou need to be tracking the right key performance indicators (KPIs) to know.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll discuss important social media KPIs, how to pick the right ones, and how to track them.\n\nBut first, let’s start with the basics.\n\nWhat Are Social Media KPIs?\n\nSocial media KPIs are the metrics you’ve selected to measure how effective your social media marketing efforts are.\n\nThey quantify whether your strategy was successful. And highlight which activities are achieving the targets—and which ones aren’t.\n\nFor example, here’s the Insights dashboard from Instagram that shows several metrics you may be tracking as KPIs:\n\nWhy Is It Important to Track Social Media KPIs?\n\nHere are some of the reasons why you should define and track social media marketing KPIs:\n\nTo measure progress toward goals: Social media KPIs provide a framework for tracking your progress toward larger department and company objectives\nTo make Informed decisions: Social media marketing KPIs highlight specific successes and reveal patterns. To provide a factual basis for strategic decisions.\nTo benchmark against the competition: They allow you to compare your performance against competitors. To gain insights into your market position and highlight areas where you have a competitive advantage.\n18 Social Media KPIs to Track\n\nThere are many different types of KPIs for social media marketing. \n\nWe’ve split them into five broad categories—and included common metrics companies typically track under each category.\n\nVisibility\nEngagement\nConversion\nCustomer satisfaction\nShare of voice\nSocial Media KPIs Focused on Visibility\n\nThese metrics show how many people (both your followers and those who don’t follow you) see your content.\n\nThe more people you’re visible to, the more opportunities you have to engage users, build relationships, and drive conversions. \n\nHere are the top social media KPIs to track visibility:\n\n1. Impressions\n\nImpressions are the total number of times your content has been displayed on a social media feed.\n\nThis metric includes every instance your content is loaded in a user's feed—whether it's an original post or a share.\n\nIt also accounts for multiple views by the same user. So, the more your content appears in feeds, the higher your impression count will be.\n\nHere's an example from LinkedIn showing the number of impressions a post has received:\n\nWhy Impressions Are Important \n\nImpressions give you a sense of how much exposure your content is getting. \n\nIf your impressions are high, it means your content is widely circulated. Which could lead to better brand recognition—and eventually more followers and higher engagement.\n\n2. Video Views\n\nVideo views refer to the number of times users have watched your video content on social media.\n\nDifferent social media platforms have different criteria for what counts as a view. \n\nFor instance, a view is counted on Facebook when a user watches the video for at least three seconds. On YouTube, it’s counted when a user watches at least 30 seconds.\n\nHere’s an example from YouTube showing the number of video views:\n\nWhy Video Views Are Important\n\nVideo views serve as an indicator of the audience’s interest in your video content.\n\nA high number of views suggests that your videos are appealing to your audience. And that your content aligns with what they want to see.\n\nThis can aid your content creation strategy. Helping you produce more of the types of videos that your audience is drawn to.\n\n3. Post Reach\n\nPost reach refers to the number of unique users who’ve seen your social media post.\n\nThis is different from impressions.\n\nHow?\n\nReach is the number of unique users who see your content—counting each user only once, regardless of multiple views\n\nHere’s an example from Facebook showing the number of people a post has reached when you click “See insights and ads”:\n\nWhy Post Reach Is Important \n\nReach helps you understand how far your content is spreading beyond your immediate followers. And gives you a good gauge of how large your potential audience may be.\n\n4. Follower Count\n\nFollower count is the number of users who’ve chosen to follow your social media profile. This count can include both individuals and brands.\n\nYour number of followers can go up when new people follow your profile. And it can go down when people decide to unfollow.\n\nBut a drop in followers isn't always bad. It could mean that your content is becoming more targeted. And that you're narrowing in on a specific audience.\n\nHere’s an example of an X (formerly Twitter) profile showing the number of followers it has:\n\nWhy Follower Count Is Important \n\nYour follower count gives you an idea of how popular your brand is. And also indicates whether people like your content and want to see more of it.\n\n5. Audience Growth Rate\n\nAudience growth rate is the pace at which your social media following is increasing (or decreasing). And it’s represented as a percentage change from one period compared to the previous period.\n\nThe audience growth rate is calculated by finding the difference between the number of followers at the end of the period and the start, then dividing by the number of followers at the start. \n\nThe result is multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nHere’s an example from an Instagram profile showing its audience growth in a week:\n\nWhy Audience Growth Rate Is Important \n\nTracking your audience growth rate helps you understand how quickly you're gaining new followers. \n\nRapid growth can be a sign of an effective social media strategy. And slow growth may indicate a need for adjustments in the social media calendar and overall approach.\n\nSocial Media KPIs Focused on Engagement\n\nEngagement metrics measure how users interact with your social media content. \n\nThey show your audience's level of involvement with your brand. Which helps indicate how much they value your posts. \n\nHere are some common social media KPIs that highlight engagement:\n\n6. Reactions\n\nReactions are a basic form of engagement. They typically involve users clicking a “Like,” “Love,” “Celebrate,” or similar button. \n\nThe type and range of reactions available can vary by social media platform.\n\nFor instance, Facebook offers a range of reactions, including \"Love,\" \"Angry,\" and \"Sad.\" While platforms like Instagram primarily focus on \"Likes.\"\n\nThese reactions provide a simple way for users to interact with your content and express their sentiments.\n\nHere’s an example from LinkedIn showing the number of reactions a post has received:\n\nWhy Reactions Are Important \n\nTracking reactions helps you understand which content is meaningful for your audience. \n\nA high number of reactions is a good sign of your content hitting the mark. And it can inform your social media content strategy. So you keep creating content your audience wants.\n\n7. Comments\n\nComments are written responses that users add to your social media content.\n\nThese responses can be directed at the original post or serve as replies to other comments.\n\nUsers may also tag your account or other users' accounts in their comments. Fostering a more interactive and engaging conversation around your content.\n\nHere’s an example from Reddit showing the number of comments a post has:\n\nWhy Comments Are Important \n\nComments show a deeper level of engagement than reactions. And they’re a very important KPI in social media. Because content with many comments may get more visibility. \n\nYou can monitor comments to gain insights into your audience's preferences. To help you improve your social media management strategy.\n\n8. Shares\n\nShares occur when users repost your content on their own social media profiles.\n\nThey might share your post just as it is. Or, they might add their own thoughts to it. \n\nWhen they add their own thoughts, it can offer more context and added perspective to the content.\n\nHere’s an example from TikTok showing the number of shares a video has received:\n\nWhy Shares Are Important \n\nA high number of shares can significantly increase your social media visibility and attract new followers.\n\nAnd because users are recommending your content, shares act as endorsements.\n\n9. Saves\n\nSaves are when users save your post for viewing later. (On X, this KPI is called a \"Bookmark.\")\n\nUsers have the flexibility to save and unsave posts at any time.\n\nThey can also go to a specific section on their profile to view all the posts they've saved.\n\nSome platforms (like Instagram) even allow users to create collections by grouping saved posts into different categories. Helping them organize content that they find valuable.\n\nHere’s what the save button looks like on an Instagram post:\n\nWhy Saves Are Important \n\nSaves indicate that users find your content valuable enough to revisit. That's a strong sign of interest and engagement. \n\n10. Average Engagement Rate\n\nYour average engagement rate can be represented in a few ways. But it’s often the percentage of people that interact with your content relative to the total number of followers you have.\n\nYou can calculate the average engagement rate by dividing the total number of engagements (likes, comments, shares, etc.) your posts received by the total number of posts in a given time frame. \n\nNext, divide that result by the number of followers you have. And then multiply by 100 to get the rate.\n\nHere’s what the formula looks like:\n\nWhy Average Engagement Rate Is Important \n\nA high engagement rate indicates that your content is resonating with your audience—sparking their interest and initiating conversations.\n\nIt demonstrates that your social content is relevant and high quality.\n\nFurther reading: 11 Ways to Create Engaging Social Media Content\n\nSocial Media KPIs Focused on Conversions\n\nConversion metrics measure how effectively your content is driving users to take a desired action. Like making a purchase or filling out a form.\n\nHere are some common conversion-focused social media KPIs:\n\n11. Click-Through Rate\n\nClick-through rate (CTR) is the percentage of people who clicked a link in your social media post compared to the total number of people who viewed the post.\n\nIt’s a common metric for evaluating ad performance. But it’s equally useful for measuring organic (meaning unpaid) social performance. \n\nCTR is calculated by dividing the number of clicks your post received by the number of impressions (total views) it got. And then multiplying the result by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nWhy Click-Through Rate Is Important \n\nThis KPI for social media helps identify which content is most effective in driving traffic to your gated content, landing pages, or other important destinations.\n\nA high CTR means your message is compelling to your audience. Leading them to take action. \n\n12. Conversion Rate\n\nThe conversion rate is the percentage of users who perform your desired action after interacting with your social media post or ad. \n\nThis could be anything from signing up for a newsletter to making a purchase.\n\nIt’s calculated by dividing the number of conversions (users who performed the action) by the total number of users who clicked on your post or ad. And multiplying the result by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nWhy Conversion Rate Is Important\n\nA high conversion rate indicates that your social media content is effective in driving users to take action. \n\nIt helps you measure the impact of your social media efforts on achieving your business goals, such as generating leads or making sales.\n\n13. Cost Per Click\n\nCost per click (CPC) is the fee you pay to an ad platform every time someone clicks on your ad.\n\nSo, this metric will only be valuable to you if you’re running paid social ads. Because there’s no advertising cost for organic posts. \n\nCPC is calculated by dividing your total ad cost by the number of clicks.\n\nBut many ad platforms include analytics that will calculate this metric for you.\n\nWhy Cost Per Click Is Important \n\nIt provides a clear measure of how much each click on your social media ad campaign costs. And enables you to evaluate whether you can optimize your strategy for better cost efficiency.\n\n14. Sales Revenue\n\nSales revenue from social media is the total amount of revenue that can be attributed to your social media marketing efforts.\n\nIt's determined by tracking the sales that originated from social media channels. \n\nThis can be done by using tracking codes in your URLs. Or through analytics tools that track the customer journey from social media clicks to purchases.\n\nWhy Sales Revenue Is Important \n\nTracking social media sales revenue shows the financial impact your social media efforts are having. And helps justify the time and resources spent on social media marketing.\n\nSocial Media KPIs Focused on Customer Satisfaction\n\nThese metrics are indicators of your customers' satisfaction levels.\n\nHigh customer satisfaction can lead to increased loyalty and future sales. Contributing to business growth.\n\nHere are some common social media KPIs that measure customer satisfaction:\n\n15. Review Ratings\n\nSocial media reviews are customers’ feedback about your product or service posted on social media platforms. And they’re usually accompanied by a rating.\n\nReview ratings are typically expressed on a scale from one to five. \n\nAnd you can calculate an average rating to quantify customer satisfaction in a holistic way.\n\nTo find your average rating, add all the individual ratings. And then divide that value by the total number of reviews.\n\nHere’s an example from Facebook showing the rating and reviews a business has gotten:\n\nWhy Review Ratings Are Important\n\nThey provide direct feedback from your customers. Helping you understand their satisfaction level and identify areas for improvement.\n\n16. Customer Satisfaction Score \n\nYour customer satisfaction (CSAT) score measures how satisfied your customers are. With the product, service, or experience.\n\nTo find your social media CSAT score, you can conduct surveys or polls on social media platforms asking followers how they would describe their overall satisfaction with the product or service.\n\nThey’ll rate their satisfaction on a scale of one to five. Where one is “very unsatisfied,” and five is “very satisfied.”\n\nThe CSAT score is determined by dividing the number of satisfied customers (those who rated their satisfaction as four or five) by the total number of responses. And then multiplying the result by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nWhy Customer Satisfaction Score Is Important\n\nYour CSAT score directly reflects the quality of your product or service from customers’ perspectives.\n\nTracking changes in this score over time can help you understand trends in customer satisfaction. Allowing you to respond proactively to shifts in customer sentiment—and maintain high quality in product, service, and support.\n\nSocial Media KPIs Focused on Share of Voice\n\nShare of voice shows how well-known your brand is compared to your competitors. \n\nIt's like measuring your piece in your niche’s conversation pie.\n\nHere are a few common social media KPIs that measure share of voice:\n\n17. Brand Mentions\n\nBrand mentions are instances when users mention your brand on social media. This can be in the form of a tag or a mention in a post or comment.\n\nThere are various tools available that allow you to measure brand mentions—even when your brand isn't directly tagged.\n\nHere’s an example from X showing a mention WordPress has received:\n\nWhy Brand Mentions Are Important\n\nTracking brand mentions helps you understand how much your brand is being talked about on social media. \n\nIt can help you assess brand awareness and sentiment. And identify advocates. \n\n18. Branded and Campaign Hashtags\n\nBranded hashtags are unique to your company (like a company name or slogan). And campaign hashtags are created for specific marketing campaigns.\n\nHashtags help categorize your posts. And make them discoverable to social media users by grouping them together under the same hashtag.\n\nHere’s an example of Webflow’s branded hashtag on LinkedIn:\n\nWhy Branded and Campaign Hashtags Are Important\n\nBranded and campaign hashtags help boost your visibility on social media.\n\nWhen users click on or search for your branded or campaign hashtag, they’re led to a collection of posts related to your brand or campaign.\n\nThis increased visibility can attract more followers and boost engagement.\n\nHow to Pick the Right Social Media KPIs\n\nWe just went over many social media KPI examples. But you don't have to track them all.\n\nHere are a few tips to choose the right social media marketing KPIs:\n\nDefine Your Objectives\n\nStart by identifying your business objectives. To inform your social media objectives and strategy.\n\nAre you aiming to increase brand awareness, drive sales, or improve customer service? \n\nYour social media KPIs should align with those goals. \n\nFor instance, the primary goal for a small business could be to boost sales. So, they might want to focus on metrics like conversion rate and sales revenue.\n\nLook at Your Industry\n\nThe industry you're in can also influence which KPIs are most important. \n\nFor example, if you're in the ecommerce industry, conversion rates and sales revenue might be your top priority. \n\nOn the other hand, if you're a nonprofit organization, average engagement rate and reach might be more important for spreading your message.\n\nYou can also get a sense of what your competitors are doing to reach their goals on social media by using EyeOn.\n\nJust enter your top competitors and click “Start monitoring.”\n\nYou will see an overview report:\n\nClick any competitor in the “Social Media Posts” module to see an overview of their social media activity and performance. \n\nAnd scroll down to see a timeline that shows their most recent social media content by week.\n\nTrack Your Competitors’ Social Media Efforts\n\nwith EyeOn\n\nTry for Free →\nChoose a Handful of KPIs to Focus on\n\nStart with a few key metrics that directly align with your business goals.\n\nAvoid tracking too many.
