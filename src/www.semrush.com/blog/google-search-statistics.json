  "content": "Google Search is a digital giant.\n\nBut how big is it, exactly? What should you know about its search users’ habits? And how is the platform adapting to recent advancements in AI?\n\nLet’s dive into the latest Google Search statistics to find out. \n\nGoogle Statistics Highlights\nThere are 5.9 million Google searches per minute\nTop-ranking Google search results see a 22.4% click-through rate \n63% of Google searches occur on mobile in the U.S.\nGoogle accounts for 91.54% of the global search engine market\n66% of web traffic referrals come from Google\nMost Google searches are three to four words long\nFeatured snippets appear twice as often on desktop as on mobile\n46% of Google searches have local intent\nGoogle’s Shopping Graph has over 35 billion product listings\n50% of the U.S. population uses voice-enabled search each day\nGeneral Google Search Statistics\n1. Google Processes 5.9 Million Searches Every Minute\n\nTo put this figure into perspective, 5.9 million searches per minute is roughly 8.5 billion searches per day. Or 3.1 trillion searches per year.\n\n(Statista, 2023)\n\n2. Top-Ranking Organic Search Results See a 22.4% Click-Through Rate\n\nAnyone familiar with SEO already understands the value of achieving a high position in Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs). \n\nAnd the stats speak for themselves. On mobile, the average click-through rate (CTR) is 22.4% for position 1, 13% for position 2, and 10% for position 3. Meanwhile, position 10 gets you just 2.3% of clicks.\n\n(Semrush, 2023)\n\nNote\n\nYou can easily track your website’s organic traffic and keyword rankings over time using our Project Dashboard.

Google’s Search Index Is Over 100,000,000 GB in Size\n\nEvery time you perform a search, Google scours hundreds of billions of webpages stored in its index to surface relevant results. \n\nThis index is built through Google’s web crawlers, which systematically move from webpage to webpage via links. And make records of what they find. \n\nAnd since content on the web is always changing, Google’s crawlers are constantly at work to ensure the data in its index stays up to date. \n\n(Google, Date Not Specified)\n\n4. 63% of Searches Occur on Mobile Devices in the U.S.\n\nDesktop devices no longer account for the majority of searches. And Google has updated its systems accordingly. \n\nIn October 2023, Google confirmed that its switch to mobile-first indexing was finally complete. In other words, Google now crawls and indexes pages from the perspective of a mobile browser.\n\nThis means mobile webpages must be optimized to perform well in search results.\n\n(Statista, 2022)\n\n5. 27.03% of Google’s Desktop Traffic Comes from the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. accounts for the most Google visits of any country. \n\nIndia is in second place, accounting for 4.46% of visits. And Brazil comes in third, at 4.41%.\n\n(Statista, 2023)\n\n6. The World’s Most Googled Terms in 2022 Were ‘YouTube’ and ‘Facebook’ \n\nFor actual Google searches, statistics show the term “YouTube” received almost 400 million monthly searches—over 3.1 billion searches during 2022. \n\nMeanwhile, “Facebook” received 322 million monthly searches. \n\n(Statista, 2023)\n\n7. 15% of Daily Google Searches Are Brand New\n\nA significant proportion of Google’s trillions of annual searches have never been searched before. \n\nThis is one of the main reasons Google continually works to improve its systems to ensure users receive helpful answers to their queries from a wide range of quality sources. \n\n(Google, 2017)\n\n8. Google’s Autocomplete Feature Reduces Typing by 25%\n\nGoogle estimates this reduction saves the world over 200 years of typing time per day. \n\nThat means humanity has won back close to 1.4 million years of typing since the autocomplete feature first launched in 2004.\n\n(Google, 2018)\n\nGoogle’s Search Engine Dominance Statistics\n9. Google Accounts for 91.54% of the Global Search Engine Market\n\nGoogle Search is the undisputed world champion of search engines. Its closest competitor, Bing, has a 3.19% global search engine market share. \n\nMore specifically, Google claims 82.74% of the desktop search engine market and a staggering 95.16% market share on mobile.\n\n(StatCounter Global Stats, 2023)\n\n10. Google’s Search Engine Market Share in North America Is 89.08%\n\nIn Europe, this figure increases to 91.91%. It grows to 95.41% in South America. And it’s 97.53% in Africa.\n\n(StatCounter Global Stats, 2023)\n\n11. 66% of Web Traffic Referrals Originated from Google in 2019\n\nGoogle is by far the leading provider of referral traffic to other websites. \n\nFacebook is the second largest provider, accounting for 5.1% of referrals in 2019. YouTube (another Google property) also contributed 3.9% of web traffic referrals in 2019.\n\n(Jumpshot via SparkToro, 2019)\n\n12. Google Sites Receive 276 Million Unique Monthly Visitors in the U.S.\n\nThis makes it the most visited multi-platform web property in the U.S. \n\nMicrosoft comes in second, with 244 million visitors. And Facebook comes in third, with 237 million visitors.\n\n(Statista, 2023)\n\n13. Google Sites Made $191 Billion in Ad Revenue in 2022\n\nGoogle properties like Google Search and YouTube generated almost $200 billion in ad revenue last year. \n\nFor perspective, that’s more than double the ad revenue they generated in 2018. \n\n(Statista, 2023)\n\nDesktop vs. Mobile Search Statistics\n14. Most Google Search Queries Are 3 to 4 Words Long\n\nIn our Zero-Clicks Study, we found that 38.2% of U.S. Google searches on desktop contain three to four words. This figure was 39.9% for mobile searches. \n\nAnd queries with one to two words account for 31.6% of searches on desktop and 31% of searches on mobile.\n\n(Semrush, 2022)\n\n15. Users Take More Time to Make a Decision When Searching on Mobile\n\nOn desktop, about 45% of users’ decisions on what to do next occurs within five seconds of searching. On mobile, this figure drops to 33%. \n\nThis could be because mobile users have a smaller screen to work with, meaning they spend more time scrolling through Google’s results. \n\n(Semrush, 2022)\n\n16. Users Reformulate Their Initial Searches More Frequently on Mobile\n\nGoogle users often refine their initial searches when they don’t find what they expect in the search results. \n\nOn desktop, users change their queries 17.9% of the time. On mobile, they do it 29.3% of the time. \n\n(Semrush, 2022)\n\n17. Desktop Searches Result in More Zero Clicks Than Mobile \n\nOn desktop, 25.6% of searches result in zero clicks. While on mobile, this only happens for 17.3% of searches.\n\nThis could be because desktop users are more likely than mobile users to encounter SERP features that answer their query directly (like a featured snippet).\n\n(Semrush, 2022)\n\n18. Different SERP Features Appear More Frequently on Mobile vs. Desktop\n\nImages appear 12.5 times more often in search results on mobile.\n\nMeanwhile, featured snippets and Google Ads are twice as prevalent on desktop. \n\n(Semrush, 2021)\n\nConsumer Behavior Search Statistics\n19. 49% of Consumers Use Google to Find New Products\n\nMany consumers habitually turn to Google when considering their next purchase, whether they plan on buying in-store or online. \n\nIn fact, 45% of shoppers use Google to research a purchase they intend to make in a physical store. \n\n(Google, 2019)\n\n20. 50% of Online Shoppers Say Images Help Them Make a Purchase\n\nProduct listings, detailed specs, and reviews aren’t enough to convince customers to buy. \n\nYou need high-quality images and videos to truly showcase your products to online shoppers in a way that persuades them to buy. \n\n(Google, 2019)\n\n21. Online Shoppers Click on 3D Images 50% More Than Static Ones\n\nGoogle encourages merchants to make the most of its advanced 3D shopping capabilities. \n\nBut 3D shopping experiences are currently only available in the U.S. and are limited to shoes and home goods. \n\n(Google, 2022)\n\n22. Google’s Shopping Graph Contains Over 35 Billion Product Listings\n\nGoogle’s Shopping Graph is an AI-powered, real-time data set storing billions of product listings. And over 1.8 billion of those listings are refreshed every hour to give users the most up-to-date, reliable product results.\n\n(Google, 2023)\n\nLocal Google Search Statistics\n23. 77% of Consumers Use Google When Looking for Local Business Information \n\nThis data on individuals from the U.S., France, Germany, and the U.K. shows people rely heavily on Google to discover information about businesses in their local area.\n\nFor this reason, businesses that maximize their online presence through local SEO stand to significantly increase local traffic, awareness, and sales.\n\n(Statista, 2023)\n\n24. 21% of People in the US Use the Internet to Find a Local Business Each Day\n\nAnd a further 32% use it to research a local business multiple times per week.\n\nThis widespread use of Google to find local businesses underscores the need to optimize your local search presence.\n\n(Statista, 2023)\n\n25. Google Maps Searches for ‘Shopping Near Me’ Increased Globally by Over 100% in 2022\n\nGoogle’s traditional search results aren’t the only way to discover information about local businesses. \n\nGoogle Maps is also a go-to source for nearby business information. \n\nCreating and optimizing your Google Business Profile (pictured below) will ensure your business is visible to local Google Maps users. \n\n(Google, 2022)\n\n26. 78% of Holiday Shoppers Who Visited a Store Search Online Before Going\n\nAppearing for relevant local searches is essential for attracting more customers to your brick-and-mortar store.\n\nHaving no online visibility could mean potential customers simply take their business elsewhere. If users can’t find basic information about your business online, it’s unlikely they’ll turn up at your door.\n\n(Google, 2018)\n\n27. 60% of Smartphone Users Have Contacted a Business Directly Using Search Results\n\nMobile users don’t just use Google to research businesses but also to contact them directly (e.g., using click to call ad extensions).\n\nAdding multiple contact options to your Google Business Profile and website makes life easier for potential customers. Which could lead to more inquiries, visits, and sales.\n\n(Google, 2019)\n\n28. Local Business Searches on Mobile Increased 250% in 2019\n\nBetween April 2016 and March 2019, mobile searches for “store near me” more than doubled.\n\nThese searches included queries like “grocery store open near me” and “auto parts store open near me.”\n\n(Google, 2019)\n\nPaid Search Statistics\n29. Google Ads Deliver a 700% ROI\n\nGoogle estimates that for every $1 an advertiser spends on Google Ads, they get $8 in profit through both search and ads.\n\n(Google, 2022)\n\n30. Google Ads Have an Average Conversion Rate of 7.04% Across All Industries\n\nThe two business categories with the highest conversion rates are physicians and surgeons as well as animals and pets. Both have an average conversion rate exceeding 13%.\n\nThe lowest-performing category is apparel, with an average conversion rate of 1.57%. \n\n(WordStream, 2023)\n\n31. The Most Expensive Google Ads Keyword in 2023 Cost Over $200 per Click\n\nKeywords within the legal industry are generally more expensive than in any other category. \n\nThis proves it: The most expensive keyword in 2023 was “motorcycle injury lawyer,” with an average cost per click (CPC) exceeding $200.\n\n(Fraud Blocker, 2023)\n\nGoogle Visual and Voice Search Statistics\n32. Half of the U.S. Population Uses Voice Search Each Day\n\nPeople are increasingly using voice search to get quick answers to simple questions without having to type.\n\nVoice search is especially popular with younger adults, with 58% of consumers between 25 and 34 using it daily.\n\n(UpCity, 2022)\n\n33. Most Voice Searches Are Related to Weather, Music, and News\n\nWeather-related queries are the most frequent types of voice searches across the U.S., the U.K., and Germany.\n\nInterestingly, more than half of voice search users in the U.S. have used the technology for food delivery compared with just 32% in Germany.\n\n(Statista, 2022)\n\n34. People Use Google Lens for 12 Billion Searches Every Month\n\nGoogle Lens is a visual search tool that uses AI to detect objects and text in images. \n\nFor example, if you point your camera at a famous landmark, Google Lens can recognize and provide facts about what it sees.\n\nThe number of searches made using Google Lens has increased by four times since 2021.\n\n(Google, 2023)\n\nSo Much for the Numbers—Time for Action\n\nHere’s what’s clear from these Google statistics: Search is more popular than ever. It’s a fixture in the lives of billions of people. And it looks like it’s here to stay. \n\nNow, it’s time for you to integrate the insights mentioned here into your own organic strategy and monitor your search engine performance with tools like Project Dashboard.\n\nGet started by clicking the “+ Create project” button in the top right-hand corner of the dashboard.\n\nEnter your domain or subdomain and give your project an optional name.
