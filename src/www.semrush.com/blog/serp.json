  "content": "What Is SERP?\n\n“SERP'' stands for “search engine results page.” It’s a page that a search engine displays to a user after they enter a search query. SERPs include links to different webpages that are relevant to the user's query, along with additional information or images.\n\nMany SERPs contain paid ads at the top, followed by organic results underneath.\n\nLike this:\n\nHowever, the SERP for one keyword can look a lot different from the SERP for another.\n\nAnd those differences have a huge impact on SEO traffic.\n\nLearn more in our guide below.\n\nWhat’s on a Google SERP? And How Do SERP Rankings Work?\n\nSearch engine results pages can include three types of listings:\n\nOrganic search results, which look like this:\n\nPaid search results, which are identified with the word “Ad:”\n\nAnd SERP features, which can show up in lots of different ways. \n\nOne common SERP feature is the “People Also Ask” box. \n\nWhich looks like this:\n\nLet’s take a closer look at all three types of search results.\n\nWe’ll discuss where they come from and how they affect SEO.\n\nOrganic Search Results\n\nGoogle gets trillions of searches per year. \n\nAnd 95% of the clicks from those searches go to the organic (unpaid) search results.\n\nWhich is why interest in SEO has been growing and growing.\n\nMost of SEO boils down to one concept:\n\nThe higher a search result is shown on the SERP, the more people tend to click on it.\n\nThe #1 ranking result is shown at the top of the SERP. \n\nSo, it usually gets the most clicks.\n\nFollowed by #2, and so on:\n\nHow much do rankings matter, exactly?\n\nA lot.\n\nHere are the average click-through rates on Google by ranking position, according to a study by Backlinko:\n\n31.73%\n24.71%\n18.66%\n13.60%\n9.51%\n\nAnd the drop-off continues from there. \n\nIn fact, the #1 ranking usually gets 10x more clicks than the #10 ranking.\n\nSo how does a page get ranked #1?\n\nWell, Google relies on hundreds of different ranking factors to decide.\n\nBut you can divide them into two major categories:\n\nOff-page SEO factors. (Like backlinks to the page.)\nOn-page SEO factors. (Like the page’s content and meta tags.)\n\nOn-page factors also affect something else:\n\nThe appearance of the search results.\n\nSpecifically, they control the search result “snippet” that’s shown on the SERP.\n\nA basic search snippet consists of three things:\n\n1. The URL or breadcrumbs, which are based on the page’s URL and navigational links.\n\n2. The title link, which is usually based on the page’s meta title tag. \n\n3. And the description, which is usually based on the page’s meta description. \n\nThat’s the basic structure.\n\nBut some search snippets are more complex than that.\n\nFor example, here is the top result for the search query “best camping stove.\"\n\nYou can see it has a few additional parts: \n\nUnlike our basic search snippet, this one has:\n\nAn image on the side\nA star rating in the middle\nAnd additional links (called “sitelinks”) at the bottom\n\nExtra pieces of information like those are called “rich snippets.”\n\nAnd they make the search result stand out, which can increase its CTR and traffic.\n\nIn other words:\n\nRich snippets are one of the ways you can get more visits from a SERP—even without improving your rankings.\n\n(SERP features are another way. But we’ll come back to those in a minute.)\n\nPaid Search Results\n\nPaid search results are the second type of listing that can appear on a SERP.\n\nOn Google, paid search results are managed via Google Ads. And they’re paid for on a cost-per-click basis.\n\nGoogle Search Ads are often shown at the top of the SERP above all the organic results. \n\nLike this:\n\nSearch ads can also be displayed at the bottom of the SERP, after the organic results:\n\nAnd some SERPs display Google Shopping Ads, which ecommerce stores use to advertise their products.\n\nFor that reason, Google Shopping Ads usually only show up when you search for a physical product.\n\nGoogle Shopping Ads look quite a bit different from regular search ads. \n\nThey contain less text, for one thing.\n\nAnd they also include images.\n\nGoogle Shopping Ads can be shown at the top, bottom, or in the middle of the SERP. \n\nOr off to the side, like this:\n\nSERP Features\n\nSERP features are the third type of result that you’ll see in the SERPs.\n\nA SERP feature is anything that isn’t a regular organic or paid search result.\n\nLike this “Featured Snippet” about the largest star in the universe:\n\nLike regular organic search results, SERP features are unpaid.\n\nGoogle calls SERP features “search features.\" \n\nAnd according to Google, the point of them is to give people “the right information at the right time in the format that’s most useful.”\n\nBut many marketers think of SERP features as something else:\n\nCompetition.\n\nThat’s because SERP features draw attention and clicks away from the regular organic search results.\n\n(In fact, only about one-third of all Google searches now result in a click on an organic result. And SERP features are one big reason why.)\n\nSERP features can even create a difference in search traffic between two very similar keywords.\n\nSometimes a very big difference—even when the keywords have the same search volume.\n\nFor example, let’s compare the keywords “mortgage comparison” and “affordable mortgages.\"\n\nBoth keywords get 1,600 searches per month:\n\nAnd both keywords have to do with mortgages, obviously.\n\nBut their SERPs are completely different.\n\nThe SERP for “mortgage comparison” is pretty traditional. \n\nIt shows four search ads at the top. \n\nAnd then goes straight into the regular organic results.\n\nThe SERP for “affordable mortgages” is a different story.\n\nIt starts with ads at the top, like the other SERP. But then it shows two separate SERP features: \n\nA “Local Pack” of Google Maps results\nAnd a “People Also Ask” box of questions\n\nAll before getting to the regular organic results.\n\nLook how far you have to scroll before you can see the first organic result on this SERP:\n\nAs mentioned, both of those keywords get 1,600 searches per month. \n\nBut the differences in their SERPs change their “Click Potential” quite a bit.\n\nClick Potential is the predicted chance of getting a click through to the regular organic results.\n\nAnd according to our Keyword Strategy Builder tool, the Click Potential for the keyword “mortgage comparison” is 70%. \n\nWhile the click potential for “affordable mortgages” is only 20%.\n\nIn effect, that means those keywords aren’t really sending 1,600 visits per month to their organic results.\n\nInstead:\n\nThe first keyword is driving about 1,120 visits per month to its organic results. Because it has 70% click potential. (70% of 1,600 = 1,120.)\nWhile the second keyword is driving only 320 visits per month to its organic results. Since it has only has 20% click potential. (20% of 1,600 = 320.)\n\n1,120 vs. 320—that’s a 3.5x difference.\n\nAnd that’s why SERP features are so important for SEO.\n\nSo it’s a good idea to look at the Click Potential for any keyword before you decide whether to target it.\n\nAnd also look at the SERP itself. That way, you’ll know which SERP features you’ll be up against.\n\nOr to avoid checking each keyword manually, you can use the “SERP features” metric in Semrush. \n\nIt shows how many SERP features are being displayed for each keyword. As well as which types they are.\n\nHere’s how the \"SERP features\" column looks in the Keyword Magic Tool:\n\nNow you’ve seen the negative impacts that SERP features can have.\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nYou can also use SERP features to your advantage. \n\nIt’s often easier to win a SERP feature than it is to climb the standard organic rankings. So you can use SERP features to leapfrog high-authority competitors.\n\nLet’s look at a quick example:\n\nThe SERP for the keyword “email service provider.\"\n\nThe regular organic rankings for this keyword include huge sites like Active Campaign and TechRadar.\n\nThose sites have really high Authority Scores, which makes them hard to beat in the regular rankings.\n\nBut above those big competitors, Google is displaying a Featured Snippet.\n\nAnd that Featured Snippet belongs to a much smaller website called Clean Email.\n\nThanks to that Featured Snippet, Clean Email is getting a large share of traffic from this keyword. Even though it has a much lower Authority Score than its larger competitors.\n\nThat’s a positive example of the power of SERP features.\n\nAnd we’re still only scratching the surface—there are over 20 different types of SERP features. \n\nLet’s cover some of the most common and important ones.\n\nThis way, you can avoid competing against them and use them to your advantage instead. \n\nThe Most Common and Important SERP Features\nFeatured Snippet\n\nA Featured Snippet is a large highlight that Google has taken from a single webpage in attempt to summarize the most important information from it.\n\nYou’ll often see Featured Snippets at the very top of the organic SERP. (In “position #0.”) \n\nThat makes them one of the most powerful SERP features.\n\nThey can also display when you expand a “People Also Ask” box.\n\nThere are several types of Featured Snippets.\n\nMany are text-heavy, like this list-based Featured Snippet for “best premium SEO software:\"\n\nOther Featured Snippets include images. \n\nHere’s the one for the search query “impressionism:\"\n\nAnd some Featured Snippets suggest a clip from an embedded video. \n\nLike this one for the keyword “how to sprint:\"\n\nPeople Also Ask\n\nPeople Also Ask boxes list several questions that are related to the original search query.\n\nThey are usually shown for keywords with commercial or informational search intent.\n\nHere’s the People Also Ask box that gets displayed when you search for “scheduling software:\"\n\nWhen you click on a question in a People Also Ask box, it expands with a Featured Snippet inside. \n\nAs well as a link to launch a new Google search using that question.\n\nLike this:\n\nRelated Searches\n\nRelated Searches are keywords that are connected to your original search query. \n\nWhen you click on one, Google opens a new SERP using that keyword.\n\nRelated Searches are displayed at the bottom of the SERP. And they’re extremely common.\n\n(In fact, most people don’t even think of them as a SERP feature.)\n\nThe most basic version of the Related Searches feature is simply a list of keywords.\n\nBut some Related Searches also include images above that. As you can see in this example, from the keyword “best premium SEO tool:\"\n\nKnowledge Panel\n\nAccording to Google, Knowledge Panels appear when you search for entities that are in Google’s Knowledge Graph. \n\nSo a single Knowledge Panel includes information from multiple different sources.\n\nKnowledge Panels are displayed on the right-hand side of the search results. \n\nThey often display:\n\nAssociated images\nA text description\nA list of facts \nLinks to additional information\n\nHere’s the Knowledge Panel for the search query “Android:\"\n\nLocal Pack\n\nLocal Packs display information about nearby businesses and organizations next to an embedded map from Google Maps.\n\nLocal Packs are displayed for search queries that might relate to a local need. So naturally, they show different results depending on where the searcher is located.\n\nThis Local Pack is shown at the top of the SERP when someone in New York City searches for “bowling alley:\"\n\nLocal Packs can also display for search queries that don’t have such obvious local search intent. \n\nBut they’ll usually be farther down on the SERP in that case.\n\nFor example, the bottom of the SERP for “glass storage containers” displays the following Local Pack.\n\nGoogle Flights\n\nFor search queries about flights, Google often displays a Google Flights SERP feature.\n\nThe Google Flights SERP feature can be interactive, like this one for the keyword “NYC to PDX:\"\n\nOr it can be more basic, like this one for the keyword “flights to Oregon:\"\n\nOrganic Google Shopping Results\n\nOrganic Google Shopping results look a lot like Google Shopping Ads. \n\n(Which we already saw in the “Paid Search Results” section above.) \n\nBut organic Google Shopping results are unpaid. So they don’t have the “Ad” disclaimer.\n\nOrganic Google Shopping results are usually displayed as a carousel of products you can scroll through. And they can be shown anywhere in the main SERP.\n\nEach organic Google Shopping result can contain:\n\nAn image of the product\nThe product name and brand\nThe retailer\nThe price\nThe average star rating\nAnd a fact or two about the product\n\nHere’s the organic Google Shopping results carousel for the keyword “home printers:\"\n\nImage Pack\n\nImage Packs are a way for Google to display images on the SERP. Clicking on one will take you to a Google Images search results page.\n\nImage Packs can be shown anywhere in the regular search results. Sometimes they’re displayed as scrollable carousels.\n\nThey can be shown as a single row or in a larger pack.\n\nHere’s the Image Pack for the keyword “Iceland:”\n\nAnd below is a larger Image Pack that displays for the keyword “Nike shoes.\" \n\nIn this case, some of the images have a shopping tag icon. This indicates that the image was taken from a retailer’s product page.\n\nVideo Results\n\nVideo Results are just what they sound like: a pack of videos on the SERP. \n\nThe videos usually come from YouTube.\n\nEach video listing can be paired with links to specific timestamps within it, as you can see in this example:\n\nRecipes\n\nYou guessed it:\n\nThe “Recipes” SERP feature can be displayed when you search for recipes.\n\nIt displays a pack of three recipe options, along with a button to show more.\n\nHere’s the one for “fried rice recipe:\"\n\nDirect Answers\n\nDirect Answers present a short piece of information at the top of the SERP. \n\nThey can be displayed when Google believes the query is a simple question. \n\nFor example, “when is Mother’s Day:\"\n\nTop Stories\n\nTop Stories displays relevant articles from Google News.\n\nFor queries that are obviously about the news, the Top Stories feature is usually shown at the top of the SERP.\n\nWhile for other queries, it may be shown lower down.\n\nHere’s today’s Top Stories pack for the query “financial news:\"\n\nTwitter\n\nIn 2015, Google partnered with Twitter to begin indexing tweets in real-time. \n\nNow when you search for the name of a business or person who is active on Twitter, there’s a good chance you’ll see their tweets.\n\nThat makes this a nice, easy way to get more real estate on the SERP.\n\nYou can see the Twitter SERP feature in action when you search for “Semrush.\"\n\n(After the regular organic search results from our domain.)\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\nTip\n\nYou can research up to 49 different SERP features on Semrush with the Organic Research tool. Find data on everything from popular features like Knowledge Panels, to more niche features like Datasets, Discussions & Forums, and Buying Guides. \n\nWrapping Up\n\nAs you can see, there’s no such thing as a standard SERP. \n\nSearch engine results pages can change drastically from keyword to keyword and from location to location. \n\n(Plus they can be personalized, too.)\n\nBut now that you understand how they work, you can take the next step in your SEO journey.\n\nIf you’re a beginner, get started with our introduction to learning SEO. \n\nOr jump into the deep end with our detailed guides to on-page SEO, off-page SEO, and technical SEO.\n\nRun a Full Keyword Analysis\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
