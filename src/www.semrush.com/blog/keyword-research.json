  "content": "What Is Keyword Research?\n\nKeyword research is the process of finding and analyzing what relevant audiences search for in search engines like Google. So you can create content that’s more likely to rank highly in search results.\n\nIt’s a crucial part of any search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. And a helpful step to take whenever you’re planning new content.\n\nFor example, a pet retailer might conduct keyword research with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. And find that:\n\nThousands of people per month search “how much food should i feed my dog”\nRanking for “royal canin dog food” is harder than ranking for “royal canin cat food”\nMost people searching “best python books” want books about coding—not snakes\n\nThis kind of information can help you spend business resources more effectively. And ultimately get more organic traffic (unpaid visits from search engines).\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nWhy Is Keyword Research Important for SEO?\n\nKeyword research is important for SEO because it tells you what relevant audiences are looking for and helps you prioritize ranking opportunities.\n\nBy creating content that satisfies target users’ needs, you can earn organic rankings in search results. Just like the ones below. And get more valuable traffic to your site.\n\nPlus, using keywords on your page can help it rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nGoogle says content relevance is one of the most important factors when ranking search results. Adding, “The most basic signal that information is relevant is when content contains the same keywords as [the] search query.”\n\nThis means it’s helpful to know the exact wording that searchers use.\n\nHow to Find Keywords\n\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to find SEO keywords that are relevant to your site.\n\nAfter that, we’ll explain how to analyze and prioritize the keywords you find.\n\nNote\n\nThe time it takes to do keyword research for SEO depends on the size of your niche, the scope of your business, and how thorough you want to be.\n\nCheck Your Existing Rankings\n\nIf you have a website, it might already appear for some relevant keywords. Meaning you have existing rankings to build upon.\n\nOne of the quickest ways to find out is with Semrush’s Organic Research tool.\n\nEnter your domain, choose your target location, and click “Search.”\n\nThen, go to the “Positions” report.\n\nThe table shows keywords you rank for and the highest position you rank in (as of the date at the top.)\n\nIf you see an icon in the “Position” column, it means your site appears in a non-standard search result known as a SERP feature.\n\nFor example, the crown icon means that you own the featured snippet (the instant answer that typically appears at the top of the SERP).\n\nLike this:\n\nNote\n\nOrganic Research will only show keywords if you rank in a top-100 organic position or SERP feature. And if the keyword appears in our database (which is the biggest on the U.S. market).\n\nLater, we’ll explain how to identify the best opportunities to improve your rankings. \n\nFor now, let’s learn how to find relevant keywords you aren’t ranking for yet.\n\nSearch a Keyword Database\n\nThe most common way to conduct keyword research is to search a keyword database.\n\nSemrush’s keyword database is the biggest on the market—it contains over 25.7 billion keywords. And you can easily search it with the Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nJust enter a seed keyword (a term to base your search around) and your domain.\n\nThen, choose your target location and click “Search.”\n\nYou can view five types of results: \n\nAll Keywords: Broad match, phrase match, exact match, and related keywords\nBroad Match: Keywords that contain any variation of your seed term with the words in any order\nPhrase Match: Keywords that contain your exact seed term with the words in any order\nExact Match: Keywords that contain your exact seed term with the words in the specified order\nRelated: Keywords that generate similar search engine results to your seed keyword\n\nGenerally, it’s best to stick with “Broad Match.”\n\nTo filter your results further, include or exclude particular terms. Using the “Include keywords” and “Exclude keywords” filters.\n\nFor example, our pet retailer might focus on “dog food” keywords that include “raw” or “natural.”\n\nAnd hide keywords including brand names they don’t stock, like “royal canin.”\n\nIf you need inspiration, the list in the left-hand column shows the most common keyword modifiers. And you can filter them in or out by clicking the eye icons. \n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool also has a dedicated filter for question keywords. \n\nLater, we’ll explain how to make use of all the keyword metrics you can see.\n\nNote\n\nSome people use Google Keyword Planner as a free alternative to Keyword Magic Tool. But it’s primarily designed for PPC (pay-per-click) keyword research. You won’t get as many useful insights, metrics, and filters that are relevant to SEO.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nConduct a Keyword Gap Analysis\n\nA keyword gap analysis reveals keywords that competitors rank for but you don’t. It’s an effective way to find relevant keywords you’re missing out on.\n\nAnd you can try it for free with Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool.\n\nJust enter your domain and up to four competitors’ domains. (You can type in your competitors manually or pick the organic competitors the tool suggests.)\n\nThen, choose your location and click “Compare.”\n\nScroll down to the keywords table and select “Missing.”\n\nThis shows you keywords that all competitors rank for but you don’t. So, they should be highly relevant.\n\nTo see keywords that at least one competitor ranks for but you don’t, go to “Untapped.”\n\nThese might be less relevant, but you could find some hidden gems.\n\nCompare Your Rankings with Competitors’\n\nwith the Keyword Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nLook at Search Suggestions in Search Engines\n\nYou can conduct basic keyword research by looking at search suggestions in search engines.\n\nFor example, Google offers autocomplete predictions when you start typing. And you can use this as a way to identify popular queries in your niche.\n\nYou can also note down keywords that appear in the “Related searches” sections of relevant SERPs.\n\nAnd question keywords that appear in “People also ask” boxes.\n\nLike this one:\n\nBut this method is time-consuming and provides a limited number of results.\n\nPlus, if you want to collect useful metrics, you’ll need to import your keywords to another tool.\n\nThat’s why we recommend sticking with dedicated keyword research tools.\n\nHow to Choose Keywords\n\nYour initial keyword research can yield thousands of keyword ideas. And not all of them will be relevant or important to your brand.\n\nTo choose the best keywords for SEO, you need to:\n\nGather useful metrics from SEO keyword research tools\nAnalyze the SERPs to see what results are shown\n\nTip\n\nIf you found any keywords outside of Semrush, try importing them into the Keyword Overview tool. This can enable you to gather useful keyword metrics and easily access non-personalized SERPs.\n\nFor the best results, we recommend working through this checklist:\n\nUnderstand Search Intent\n\nSearch intent is the reason behind a user’s search.\n\nTo understand what a keyword can do for your business—and how to rank for it—you need to know the search intent behind it.\n\nFor example, people who search “pedigree small dog” typically want to purchase Pedigree-branded food for small dog breeds. So, the top-ranking results are all product pages.\n\nWhen you research keywords in Semrush, you can see what type(s) of intent a keyword has.\n\nThere are four categories:\n\nNavigational: The user is looking for a specific page (e.g., “pedigree foundation”)\nInformational: The user is looking for general information on a topic (e.g., “can dogs eat spicy food”)\nCommercial: The user is researching their options before making the final decision on which product to buy (e.g., “best dry dog food”)\nTransactional: The user is looking for a specific product or brand, with the intention to make a purchase (e.g., “pedigree puppy food”)\n\nYou can get further insights into search intent by looking at the top-ranking results.\n\nJust click the “View SERP” button or icon. Here’s what the icon looks like in the Keyword Magic Tool:\n\nFor example, our pet retailer might think to target “best dog food” on their dog food category page.\n\nBut all the top results are roundups from industry publications:\n\nThis suggests that it will be difficult for the pet retailer to secure a high ranking—especially with a product category page.\n\nInstead, they can target a keyword like “dry dog food” that has commercial intent:\n\nAnd a SERP containing mostly product and category landing pages:\n\nLook at Keyword Search Volumes\n\nSearch volume tells you how many times searchers enter a particular keyword into Google per month (on average). \n\nThe higher the search volume, the more traffic you can get if you rank well for that keyword. So, all else being equal, you should prioritize higher-volume keywords.\n\nYou’ll see volumes when doing keyword research with the Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nAnd you can filter for keywords with specific volumes (e.g., over 100 searches per month).\n\nTip\n\nDon’t get too hung up on search volumes. Sometimes, you can target multiple keywords on one page, and all those smaller volumes add up. We’ll talk more about this later.\n\nYou can look up keyword volumes for specific keywords using the Keyword Overview tool.\n\nThis tool even lets you check search volumes in specific regions (e.g., cities).\n\nAnd compare search volumes across different countries.\n\nConsider Personal Keyword Difficulty\n\nIn Semrush, keyword difficulty (KD%) measures how hard it is to rank in Google’s top 10 organic results for a given search term. \n\nPersonal keyword difficulty (PKD%) measures how hard it is for your domain specifically. \n\nIt considers factors like:\n\nThe authority of your domain vs. the top-ranking domains\nYour current ranking position\nThematic relevance between your site and the keyword (i.e., your topical authority)\n\nThe higher the score out of 100, the harder it’ll be to earn a high ranking. And therefore earn organic traffic.\n\nFor example, “healthy dog food” has a 91% keyword difficulty score.\n\nChewy.com (an authoritative pet retailer) has a 22 PKD% for this keyword. If they create quality content on this topic, it should be relatively easy for them to break into the top ten.\nTheurbanpet.net (a lower-authority pet retailer) has a 76 PKD% for this keyword. To realistically compete for a high ranking, they need to improve their website authority.\nSemrush.com (a high-authority marketing site that’s unrelated to the pet industry) has a 100 PKD% for this keyword. Because the keyword isn’t relevant to Semrush’s content.\n\nTo see personal keyword difficulty scores in the Keyword Magic Tool, you’ll need to provide your domain.\n\nLike this:\n\nThe “PKD %” column contains your personal keyword difficulty score for each resulting keyword.\n\nIt’s a good idea to focus on lower-difficulty keywords. So that you’re more likely to rank highly and see results from your SEO efforts.\n\nClick “Personal KD %” to filter your results based on this metric.\n\nFor example, you can focus on keywords in the 0-29% range: \n\nTip\n\nYou can review your level of topical authority for a keyword in the Keyword Overview tool. You can also see your personal keyword difficulty score, potential position, and much more.\n \n\nCheck for SERP Features\n\nSERP features can present both an opportunity and a threat.\n\nOpportunity: You can rank organically for some SERP features. This can lead to more impressions and clicks, because SERP features tend to stand out and provide more information.\nThreat: Some SERP features eliminate the need for users to click on results. Or detract clicks from standard organic results (because they grab users’ attention).\n\nSo, their presence may affect your keyword decisions.\n\nFor example, the top organic result for “cat food” appears pretty far down the page:\n\nRather than trying to get the top organic result, you might be better off optimizing for the popular products SERP feature.\n\nOr targeting another keyword altogether.\n\nNote\n\nWe’ll talk more about how to pursue organic rankings and SERP features later.\n\nWhen you do keyword research using Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool, you can see how many SERP features each keyword triggers.\n\nAnd hover to see exactly which ones they are.\n\nYou can also click the SERP icon to view the results page for yourself. And get an idea of how much visibility each result is getting.\n\nIf you want to avoid (or pursue) keywords that trigger certain SERP features, use the filter option.\n\nLike so:\n\nTip\n\nUse the Semrush Sensor to see how prevalent each SERP feature is in your business category.\n \n\nDo a Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\nKeyword analysis is ultimately about weighing the cost of getting a keyword ranking against its potential value.\n\nTo evaluate costs, you need to think about time and money. So, ask yourself:\n\nHow long will it take to create and maintain high-ranking content?\nDo we have the ability to create the content in-house?\nDo we need to invest in content creation tools?\nWho will create the content and what could they be doing instead?\n\nNow, let’s look at the benefits your optimized content could generate:\n\nBrand awareness\n\n\t\n\nThe amount of exposure your result gets largely depends what type of result it is, what position it’s in, and the keyword’s search volume. You may also get more visibility on desktop SERPs compared to mobile SERPs.\n\n\n\n\nOrganic traffic\n\n\t\n\nThe number of clicks your result gets depends on its type/position, the keyword’s search intent, and the keyword’s search volume. You can get organic traffic estimates when you analyze SERPs in Keyword Overview (and some other tools).\n\n\n\n\nConversions\n\n\t\n\nThe number of organic visits that translate into conversions (desirable actions) depends heavily on search intent. To get an idea, look at the cost per click (CPC) metric in Semrush. This tells you how much advertisers are willing to pay for a click from the SERP—the higher the amount, the more valuable the keyword is likely to be.\n\n\n\n\nBacklinks\n\n\t\n\nLinks from other sites (backlinks) can drive referral traffic and benefit your SEO. The amount you can generate depends significantly on the topic and quality of your content. Which you can learn more about in our guide to link bait.\n\n\n\n\nTopical authority\n\n\t\n\nBy developing high-quality content on topics relevant to your brand, you can build a strong reputation among search engines and users. This can ultimately lead to more traffic, backlinks, and conversions.\n\nQuantifying these benefits is tricky. But as you work on your content strategy and monitor your results, you should develop a good instinct for what works for your brand.\n\nFor detailed advice, check out our guide to SEO forecasting.\n\nHow to Target Keywords\n\nOnce you’ve chosen your target keywords, make sure to record them along with any useful insights.\n\nIn Semrush, you can use the checkboxes and “+ Add to keyword list” button to save keywords in the Keyword Strategy Builder.\n\nWhen you’re done with that, it’s time to develop a keyword strategy and start creating content.\n\nHere are our top tips for success:\n\nDo Keyword Mapping\n\nKeyword mapping is the process of matching each target keyword with the page (or prospective page) on your site that satisfies its search intent.\n\nIt allows you to plan and optimize content more effectively.\n\nHere’s a quick example of a keyword map in action:\n\nTarget Keyword(s)\n\n\t\n\nTarget URL Slug\n\n\n\n\ndog food, pet food for dogs\n\n\t\n\n/shop/dog-food/\n\n\n\n\nroyal canin dog food, royal canin adult dog food, royal canin canned dog food\n\n\t\n\n/shop/dog-food/royal-canin/\n\n\n\n\nbest dog food, what is the best dog food, best dog food 2024 \n\n\t\n\n/blog/best-dog-food/\n\nNotice that we’ve grouped keywords with overlapping search intent. This is called keyword clustering, and it can help you get better SEO results.\n\nYou can streamline the process with Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder.\n\nJust open one of the keyword lists you created earlier.\n\nThen, click “Cluster this list.” \n\nThe tool will cluster your keywords based on topic. You should target each cluster on a different page on your site. \n\nUse these metrics to identify the best opportunities:\n\nIntent: A breakdown of search intent types\nKeywords: The number of keywords in the cluster\nKD %: The average keyword difficulty score\nVolume: The collective keyword search volume\n\nTip\n\nClusters with a relatively high volume and low difficulty score get a “high ranking potential” tag.\n\nClick the arrow to see all the keywords in a cluster.\n\nAlso look at the top-performing pages for these keywords. And use them as inspiration.\n\nAll this information will help you create SEO-optimized content. As you’ll discover in the following steps.\n\nTip\n\nYou can also use the Keyword Strategy Builder to collect new keyword ideas. Just enter a seed keyword, choose your target country, and click “Create list.”\n \n\nCreate Keyword Clusters\n\nwith the Keyword Strategy Builder\n\nTry for Free →\nFocus on Content Quality and Usability\n\nContent quality is one of the most important factors in search engine rankings.\n\nTo create quality content, you generally need to:\n\nSatisfy search intent\nPresent your content effectively\nProvide accurate and up-to-date information\nDeliver a great user experience\nDemonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) \n\nSecondly, think about how to provide added value and stand out among your competition. That might involve doing things like:\n\nCovering the topic more thoroughly\nUsing a new, unique angle\nProviding helpful examples\nAdding original data\nCreating original media\n\nFor example, Rover’s dog feeding guide satisfies search intent by providing detailed guidelines for various kinds of dog. \n\nThe guide also includes lots of related information and resources. Which come from reliable sources like veterinarian Dr. Jamie Whittenburg.\n\nRover uses subheadings, bullet points, tables, bolding, a table of contents, and other formatting tricks to make information easier to find and digest.\n\nAnd even provides a video for people who prefer to get information that way.\n\nUse Keywords Strategically\n\nIncluding keywords on your page can help it rank higher. But keyword stuffing (using keywords unnaturally) can do more harm than good. \n\nHere are some tips to help you get the balance right:\n\nOnly include keywords where they read naturally\nConvert keywords into their correct grammatical forms (e.g., “Pedigree for small dogs” not “pedigree small dog”)\nUse your primary keyword in the:\nBody content—particularly the first paragraph\nTitle tag: The page title that can appear in search results\nH1 tag: The on-page title, which should be similar or identical to the title tag\nMeta description: The page summary that can appear in search results\nURL slug: The unique part of the webpage address\nUse other (secondary) keywords within the body content and subheading tags where relevant\n\nTip\n\nYou can see how your top-ranking competitors use keywords with the SEO Content Template tool.\n \n\nYou can also use keywords strategically when linking to your page.\n\nSearch engines use the text used for links (anchor text) to understand what linked pages are about. This means that keyword-rich anchor text can help Google understand which pages should rank for which keywords. \n\nFor example, you might build an internal link from “/dog-food/” to “/dog-food/pedigree/” using the anchor text “Pedigree dog food.” So it’s clear which page is the most relevant result for this term.\n\nPrioritize Keywords with Existing Rankings\n\nGenerally, it’s a good idea to optimize existing content before creating content from scratch.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt tends to be quicker and easier\nYou may have existing rankings to build upon\nThe presence of poor-quality content can harm your site’s reputation and rankings\nExisting content is likely to be most relevant and important to your business\n\nIf you need help prioritizing pages and tasks, use Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker.\n\nYou set the target keyword(s) for each URL, and the tool provides:\n\nOptimization ideas based on best practices and top-ranking pages\nPriority ratings based on the number of ideas, keyword search volumes, and keyword difficulty scores\n\nOptimize Existing Content\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nSign Up Now →\nAdvanced Keyword Research Tips\n\nFeeling confident with what you’ve learned so far? Check out these advanced keyword research tips:\n\nFind and Use Semantic Keywords\n\nSemantic keywords are words and phrases that are conceptually related to a given topic.\n\nThey’re not terms that people use to search for a piece of content. They’re terms that search engines and users may expect to find within a given piece of content.\n\nIf they’re missing, it might suggest that your content is incomplete.\n\nLet’s say you’re writing a dog feeding guide. This should probably include semantic keywords like:\n\nHealthy weight\nPortion size\nSenior dogs\n\nOne of the best ways to find semantic keywords is with Semrush’s SEO Content Template. \n\nIt identifies semantically related keywords by analyzing the top-ranking results for your target keywords.\n\nFor example, here are the suggestions for “how much food should I feed my dog”:\n\nAnticipate Keyword Trends\n\nTo get ahead of your competitors, try to anticipate upcoming keyword trends.\n\nOne of the best ways to do this is to use Google Trends. Because it tells you which search terms are gaining popularity.\n\nFor example, let’s explore the topic of “dog food” over the past 30 days.\n\nIn the “Related queries” section, we can see keywords with “the biggest increase in search frequency since the last time period.”\n\nThe percentage increase is listed on the right. (“Breakout” means that it was over 5,000%.)\n\nBy quickly creating content around these keywords, you can gain valuable rankings. Before your competitors even realize the terms are popular.\n\nYou can also anticipate keyword trends by:\n\nKeeping up with industry news\nSeeing what relevant communities talk about on social media\nSpeaking to or surveying your customers\nKeyword Research Tools\n\nWe’ve already shared some options, but let’s look at some of the best and most popular tools for SEO keyword research:\n\nSemrush Keyword Research Tools\n\nHere’s a quick summary of Semrush’s SEO keyword research tools (many of which we’ve discussed in this guide):\n\nKeyword Overview: Gather metrics for up to 100 keywords at once\nOrganic Research: Enter a domain or URL to see what keywords it ranks for \nKeyword Magic Tool: Use a seed keyword to search our huge keyword database\nKeyword Gap: Compare your keyword rankings against competitors’\nKeyword Strategy Builder: Plan effective topic clusters to target your keywords \nOrganic Traffic Insights: Combine keyword data from Google Analytics, GSC, and Semrush\n\nCreate a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to try them out right away. You’ll also get access to other SEO tools.\n\nSERP Gap Analyzer\n\nUse the SERP Gap Analyzer app to find keywords competitors rank highly for with weak content. Which reveals great opportunities to get ahead.\n\nAll you have to do is enter your domain and a relevant topic. Then, wait for the app to create your report.\n\nYou’ll see a variety of keyword suggestions and a difficulty rating for each:\n\nClick “View details” to see weaknesses in the top-ranking content. \n\nThis gives you a good idea of what you must do to outrank your competitors.\n\nYou can then click “Generate Content” to get an AI-generated title, content brief, article, or meta description for your keyword.\n\nTip\n\nCheck out other keyword research apps and content creation apps in the Semrush App Center.\n\nGoogle Search Console\n\nGoogle Search Console (GSC) shows up to 1,000 of the most popular keywords your site ranks for.\n\nAfter signing in, go to “Performance” > “Search results.” And check all the boxes at the top.\n\nThen, scroll down to the “Queries” table.\n\nIn addition to the keywords, you’ll see the following metrics for your selected date range:\n\nClicks: The number of clicks your result was clicked\nImpressions: The number of times your search result was seen\nCTR: The click-through rate, which is the percentage of impressions that generate clicks\nPosition: The average ranking of your highest result for each query\n\nIntegrate GSC with your Semrush account (along with Google Analytics) to get valuable keyword insights in one place.\n\nGoogle Keyword Planner\n\nGoogle Keyword Planner had long been a go-to free keyword research tool for many marketers. But it’s become increasingly difficult to get exact search volume data in the tool.\n\nStill, it can be a valuable tool if you’re on a tight budget.\n\nJust keep in mind that Keyword Planner is made for Google Ads users. It doesn’t provide any information about organic ranking difficulty, search intent, etc.\n\nGoogle Trends\n\nAlthough not exactly a keyword research tool, Google Trends can be very useful when it comes to:\n\nFinding trending topics\nComparing the popularity of two or more products/services\nEstimating the long-term popularity of a keyword or topic\nTrack Your Keyword Rankings and Keep Improving\n\nOne of the best ways to measure the success of your keyword research and optimization strategy is to track your Google rankings.\n\nSemrush’s Position Tracking tool makes it easy to see how things are going.\n\nJust import your keywords from Keyword Strategy Builder (or elsewhere). \n\nThen, watch how your overall visibility and individual rankings change over time.\n\nDon’t forget to keep adding new keywords as you target them.\n\nWe recommend that you conduct keyword research every few months at a minimum. So you can capitalize on new ranking opportunities and keep growing your traffic.\n\nFind, Analyze, and Track Keywords\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
