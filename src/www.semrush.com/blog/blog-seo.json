  "content": "Today, you’ll learn exactly how to optimize your blog for SEO. And get more traffic.\n\nWe’ve used the steps in this post to grow our own blog to roughly 1.1 million organic search engine visitors per month.\n\n(Organic traffic estimation in Semrush’s Domain Overview tool)\n\nBut before we get into the specific tactics, let’s understand the basics first.\n\nWhat Is Blog SEO?\n\nBlog SEO is the process of writing, optimizing, and publishing blogs designed to rank in search engines like Google and Bing.\n\nCommon tasks associated with blog SEO include:\n\nPerforming keyword research\nCreating quality content\nOptimizing content for on-page SEO\nBuilding backlinks\nHow Does Blogging Help With SEO?\n\nBlogging is one of the most effective strategies to help you grow your organic traffic and reach more customers. It can help you rank for more keywords, earn backlinks, boost brand awareness, and keep your site content fresh and current. \n\nHowever, it requires planning, research, optimization, and promotion to make it work.\n\nWhy Is Blog SEO Important?\n\nAnyone can create a blog. But not everyone who creates a blog gets traction.\n\nBut optimizing your blog for SEO can earn you free traffic from search engines.\n\nAny independent blogger or online business with a blog can benefit from SEO.\n\nBy attracting visitors that are interested in your content, you can:\n\nGrow your blog’s audience\nEstablish yourself as a thought leader in your niche\nIncrease newsletter signups\nGenerate more leads for your business\nSEO Blog Tips\n\nHere are eight essential tips to help you optimize your blog:\n\nWrite about topics people are searching for\nGet the search intent right\nCreate quality content\nDo on-page SEO\nMake your blogs easy to read\nMonitor technical SEO issues\nBuild backlinks\nUpdate older content\n1. Write About Topics People Are Searching For\n\nTo earn traffic from Google, you need to write about topics people are searching for.\n\nBut how do you find such topics?\n\nUse keyword research tools like Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a broad keyword related to your niche. For example, if you run a health and fitness blog, that keyword could be “exercise.”\n\nThen, click “Search.” \n\nToggle to the “Questions” tab.\n\nThe tool will show a large pool of topic ideas. Along with important keyword metrics like search volume and keyword difficulty.\n\nSearch volume is the average number of times a keyword is searched for each month.\n\nKeyword difficulty tells you how hard it would be to rank organically in the top 10 search engine results.\n\nIf your blog is new and you want to rank relatively quickly, focus on topics with lower keyword difficulty.\n\nTo find such topics, set the KD (Keyword Difficulty) filter to “Easy.”\n\nNow you have a list of topics that are easier to rank for.\n\nGo through the list. And pick topics that interest you and are relevant for your business to cover.\n\nFind Blog Keyword Ideas\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Get the Search Intent Right\n\nOnce you know which topics to write about, the next step is to understand search intent. And to create content accordingly. \n\nSearch intent is the why behind searches.\n\nBlog keywords typically have informational search intent: The searcher is looking for information.\n\nAnd that information could be delivered in one of these content formats:\n\nHow-to guide\nListicle\nDefinition post\nComparison post\n\nIf you want your blog to rank higher, deliver information in the content format searchers are interested in.\n\nAnalyze the top-ranking pages to figure that out.\n\nFor example, here are the top results for “how to lose belly fat.”\n\nMost of the top-ranking pages are listicles with tips for losing belly fat.\n\nTo rank for this keyword, you likely have to create something similar—i.e., a listicle post with tips.\n\n3. Create Quality Content\n\nCreate quality content, and Google is likely to reward you with higher rankings and more traffic.\n\nAccording to Google’s guidelines, quality content is useful and interesting. And that means it is:\n\nClearly organized\nEasy to read\nUnique and fresh\nSatisfying the search intent\nFollowing Google’s E-E-A-T guidelines. \n\nHiring subject matter experts to create your content is a great start.\n\nTheir level of knowledge in a particular field will be reflected in their content.\n\nFor example, the content you see on our blog is created by SEOs and marketers with years of experience in the field.\n\nMy colleague, Zach Paruch, has more than eight years of experience in SEO and web marketing.\n\nThe content he has written for us is useful, informative, and well-written.\n\nIt is clearly organized with headings and subheadings:\n\nEasy to read with short paragraphs and simple words:\n\nAnd thorough and in-depth:\n\nYou need to do the same for your content.\n\n4. Do On-Page SEO\n\nWhen you’re doing SEO for a blog, you also need to implement on-page SEO best practices.\n\nSo Google can better understand your content. And rank it properly.\n\nUse the following tips:\n\nInclude your target keyword in the title tag. This helps demonstrate to searchers and Google that your blog post is the most relevant result for a particular query.\nWrite a compelling meta description. Because you want people to click on your blog post once it ranks in search results, your meta description should be compelling.\nUse short, descriptive URLs. This lets searchers know what to expect from a blog. (e.g., domain.com/blog/weight-loss-tips/ is clearly a post about “weight loss tips”). \nInclude your target keyword in the H1 tag. This will help your page rank for the term\nInclude your target keywords in the body. This shows Google that your content is relevant for specific queries. But don’t add them in unnaturally. \nLink to relevant internal resources. This helps users and Google find other relevant content on your website. \nAdd alt text to images. Google uses alt text to rank images in Google images.\n\nIf you’re a WordPress user, installing an SEO plugin like Yoast will make the above tips much easier to implement.\n\nThen, use Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker tool to cross-check whether your blogs are properly optimized.\n\nFirst, configure the tool for your site.\n\nAfter the setup is complete, click the “Optimization Ideas” tab.\n\nHere, you’ll see a list of blogs on your site. And a number of optimization ideas for each post.\n\nClick on “X ideas.”\n\nThe content section should tell you whether your blogs are optimized for on-page SEO.\n\nCheck Your Blog’s On-Page SEO\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Make Your Blogs Easy to Read\n\nIf your content is difficult to follow, readers might abandon your article (and your site).\n\nWhich is not good for SEO.\n\nWork to solve this problem by creating an effortless reading experience.\n\nHere are some ideas:\n\nUse subheadings (H2 to H6). Subheadings break down a lengthy post and guide readers through what to expect from each section.\nAdd visual assets. Custom images, infographics, videos, and GIFs help keep your readers engaged.\nUse short sentences and paragraphs. This helps you avoid “walls of text.”\nUse bullet points and numbered lists. This helps you provide information succinctly.\nRead your writing out loud. This helps you identify and fix areas where your writing doesn’t flow well.\nUse simple words. Avoid complex vocabulary and jargon so everyone can understand your writing.\n\nSemrush’s SEO Writing Assistant checks the readability of your content. And tells you how easy it is to read and understand.\n\nIf your content has readability issues, the tool will show you what sentences or words could be rewritten to improve readability.\n\nImprove Your Content’s Readability\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\n6. Monitor Technical SEO Issues\n\nIf Google can’t crawl and index your blogs, it doesn’t matter what SEO tactics you’ve used. Your blogs just can’t rank.\n\nAdditionally, if your blogs take more than a few seconds to load, users might abandon your site. \n\nTechnical SEO issues like these are not good for SEO. Or your business.\n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to monitor and fix technical SEO issues. \n\nFirst set up a full crawl of your site.\n\nOnce the crawl is complete, navigate to the “Issues” tab. You’ll see the technical issues detected for your site.\n\nClick the “Why and how to fix it” link next to each issue to understand why something is an issue and how to fix it.\n\n7. Build Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are an important ranking factor for Google. \n\nA good SEO strategy includes a solid backlinking strategy. \n\nThis is especially true if your blogs target popular keywords with high competition.\n\nThere are lots of strategies for link building.\n\nLet’s walk through one: broken link building.\n\nIt’s where you find dead (broken) blogs on your competitors’ websites and ask those linking to them to link to your topically similar, functioning blogs instead.\n\nThis strategy can be effective because no one wants to send their audience to broken or outdated content.\n\nStart by entering your competitor’s URL into Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool. Click “Analyze.”\n\nThen, head over to the “Indexed Pages” tab. And check the “Broken Pages” box.\n\nTo see a list of your competitor’s non-working blog posts.\n\nReview the blog topics to see if you have already covered the same topics on your site.\n\nIf you haven’t, consider covering them if they’re relevant for your business, too.\n\nAfter that, reach out to websites linking to those dead blogs. And ask them to link to your blog posts on the same topic instead.\n\nClick the numbers in the “Domains” column. These are the websites you can reach out to for backlinks.\n\nDon’t know how to reach out? Check out our guide to email outreach to get started.\n\n8. Update Older Content\n\nOver time, blog content becomes outdated. \n\nThe search intent of your target keywords will likely change. Or the related industry will change.\n\nAnd your rankings may drop as a result.\n\nWhen that happens, you need to refresh your blog posts.\n\nWe do this all the time at Semrush.\n\nFor example, we recently updated our guide to marketing funnels. And as you can see below, our organic traffic spiked.\n\nBut how do you know which blog posts to update?\n\nPut some of your older blogs into Semrush’s Organic Research tool and look at the organic traffic graph.\n\nFor example, if we do this for our Shopify SEO guide, we see a drop in traffic over time. So it may be worth updating this post.\n\nWhen updating posts, consider these best practices:\n\nUpdate outdated facts and sources\nAdd actionable advice\nCut sections that are no longer relevant\nEdit and revise with search intent in mind\n\nAnd sometimes, it’s best to rewrite the entire post. Don’t be afraid to do that.\n\nMonitor your updated content’s progress and watch your traffic increase with your updating efforts.\n\nStart Optimizing Your Blogs Today\n\nBlogging and SEO go hand in hand.\n\nIf you follow the above tips, you’re on your way to improving your Google rankings.\n\nBut SEO tools can help you get there faster and more efficiently.\n\nSemrush offers a suite of SEO tools to help you with various SEO tasks, such as keyword research, on-page SEO, link building, and more.\n\nThey’re immensely valuable for anyone who’s serious about increasing traffic from Google.\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
