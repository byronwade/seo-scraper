  "content": "Incorporating AI SEO software into your marketing efforts gives you the opportunity to improve search engine rankings, drive organic traffic to your website, and save time creating content.\n\nIn short, the best AI SEO tools can be vital to the success of your online content.\n\nBelow, we’ll cover 10 popular AI-powered SEO tools and how you can use them to drive results.\n\nAs an added bonus, we'll also discuss Semrush's Copilot, a free AI SEO tool included with all Semrush memberships. So you can start optimizing without the need for a separate subscription.\n\n1. Clearscope\n\nImage Source: Clearscope\n\nClearscope uses natural language processing to help uncover search intent. When you enter a keyword, its AI-driven algorithm looks at competitors’ content and pulls out common themes and questions that are relevant to your target audience. \n\nThe tool generates a report of keywords and suggested headers based on up-to-date competitor insights. \n\nThis helps writers, marketers, and SEO professionals create optimized content.\n\nThe real-time data is critical for matching search intent.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe search intent for the word “coda” changed after the release of the movie CODA. It caused SERPs (search engine results pages) to prioritize articles related to the film over those about the collaborative doc platform, Coda.\n\nClearscope also runs your content through a grading system to see how well you rank for search intent.\n\nIts research function analyzes the top-ranking pages for a given keyword. And it provides data-driven recommendations for improving on-page SEO elements, such as word count, headings, and keyword usage. \n\nClearscope also identifies unused words and phrases from competitors’ content, helping you optimize your own content to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nImage Source: Clearscope\n\nMain Use Cases\nUsing real-time data to pinpoint search intent\nGiving data-driven recommendations to improve on-page SEO\nIdentifying unused words and phrases from competitors’ content\nPricing\n\nClearscope pricing starts at $170 per month. You can also book a demo with the sales team.\n\n2. Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSemrush’s SEO Writing Assistant (SWA) analyzes the SEO potential of your content and offers real-time feedback to help you improve readability, tone of voice, originality, and structure.\n\nThe tool uses AI in its Rephraser, Compose, and Ask AI features to assist you in composing and rewriting text. \n\nHow does it work?\n\nStart by entering one or more keywords. Then, choose your target audience and click “Get recommendations.”\n\nYou can then import existing content or simply begin typing. SEO Writing Assistant will analyze the text and give you a score based on readability, SEO, originality, and tone of voice.\n\nBeneath your score, you’ll see the Smart Writer menu with options for creating or enhancing your content using AI.\n\nThe Rephraser feature uses an AI algorithm to generate variations of content you want to rephrase, simplify, expand, or summarize. Select the text you want to change and click which option you want to employ:\n\nThe algorithm will generate a new version of the content to fit your request. You can also click the Rephraser option on the menu and enter the text you want to revise. \n\nThe tool will generate several options for you to choose from.\n\nSEO Writing Assistant can also help you compose new content or generate text to fill in gaps in an existing piece. \n\nClick “Compose.”\n\nThe Compose tool uses AI to predict seamless content generation based on your keywords and existing text. You can then decide whether to accept or reject the new text. Or ask the tool to try again. \n\nFinally, you can use AI algorithms to get more information on your topic. Click the “Ask AI” button and enter a question.\n\nThe AI tool will generate an answer based on its analysis of the topic. \n\nMain Use Cases\nGenerating and refining optimized content with ease\nEnhancing SEO with keyword recommendations based on real-time data\nMaintaining your brand's voice across all content you create\nPricing\n\nSemrush pricing starts at $139.95 per month and offers a free trial for seven days. \n\nFurther reading: SEO Writing Guide + 9 Tips to Optimize Your Content\n\n3. ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT is an AI-powered natural language processing tool that can assist with writing tasks (e.g., emails, blog articles, social media, and programming code), answer questions, and engage in human-like conversations.\n\nOne of its main strengths is its capacity to learn and adapt to new contexts.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nUnlike some tools, ChatGPT can retain information from previous conversations and use it to generate more relevant responses by feeding it prompts with detailed information.\n\nBut ChatGPT has known issues—feeding disinformation, fueling conspiracy theories, and not reliably citing sources. So, proceed with caution.\n\nTo add an SEO element to your content, just prompt ChatGPT to generate anything from meta descriptions to headings and other on-page elements. \n\nHere’s an example of how ChatGPT can help write SEO content:\n\nYou can also use it to ask for a list of keywords related to the ones you’re targeting. \n\nIt won’t show how popular the keywords are, but it can help you by providing words to research.\n\nAmong other features, it can also help you generate schema markup to improve visibility and help your site take up more real estate in search results. \n\nImage Source: ChatGPT\n\nOnce generated, you can paste the snippet in your CMS’s HTML text editor. \n\nYou can also create FAQs for articles by asking the tool what questions people ask about a given topic.\n\nFurther reading: How Does ChatGPT Work? (Simple & Technical Explanations)\n\nMain Use Cases\nGenerating on- and off-page SEO elements like schema markup, meta titles, and FAQs\nUsing prior conversations to generate more relevant content \nWriting content based on keywords, blog post subjects, and more\nPrice\n\nChatGPT is free for everyone. ChatGPT Plus costs $20 per month for access to more premium features.\n\n4. Writesonic\n\nImage Source: Writesonic\n\nWritesonic is built on OpenAI’s GPT-3.

It also generates landing page copy. \n\nUsers can input specific parameters, such as the topic, tone, and style. And Writesonic will generate content that matches those parameters. \n\nYou can then edit and refine the generated content to your liking. \n\nHere’s an example of Writesonic’s output for story creation:\n\nImage Source: Writesonic\n\nWritesonic also includes 70+ use cases for various businesses, like landing page copy. \n\nIts free Landing Page Generator is designed to write website copy based on your brand.

Brand24\n\nBrand24 is an excellent backlink building tool. Especially when it comes to identifying unlinked mentions (i.e., people mentioning a brand without linking to its website).\n\nNote\n\nBacklinks are essential for SEO. Because Google sees links to your site from reputable websites as votes of confidence.

Your queries help it provide comprehensive insights (e.g., outline suggestions, content gaps, keyword research, and average word count).\n\nOnce you enter your focus keyword for any given content, Frase’s AI algorithm analyzes the top results for that keyword to provide insights like: \n\nAverage number of words, headers, links, and images\nCommonly used headers\nFrequently asked questions \nKey stats\nRecent news about the keyword\nRelated Wikipedia articles\n\nThe algorithm will also generate headings from search results or ideas to save users time when creating content. \n\nOnce you create your content, Frase identifies unused words or phrases from competitors’ content. \n\nIt then shows users where they might rank in the SERPs due to keyword usage, links, domain authority, and word count.\n\nMain Use Cases\nDiscovering important topics related to your industry\nGenerating headings based on SERP competitors\nShowing how optimization can impact KPIs (key performance indicators)\nPrice\n\nFrase offers a five-day trial for $1.

It costs $149 per month for the standard plan.\n\n9. Copy.ai\n\nCopy.ai is another writing tool built on OpenAI’s GPT-3 large language model. It uses machine learning to generate personalized sales copy, long-form posts, product descriptions, and more. \n\nIt also includes social media post generation.\n\nUsers input what platform to tailor the content to and the main points to cover.

Human involvement in the content creation process is needed to maintain high-quality standards.\n\nWhy?\n\nAI can access data quickly. But it doesn’t always accurately cite sources or understand context, nuance, and subjective factors that content creation requires. \n\nMarketing tech founder Nate Materson shared an example of how AI-created content initially worked for a company but later saw diminishing performance. \n\nThe charts in the example show how organic traffic and keyword rankings dropped off:\n\nThe takeaway is clear: AI SEO tools should complement human content creation. Keep this in mind as you incorporate AI SEO tools.\n\nA Ticket to SEO Success\n\nWe covered the 10 best AI SEO tools to help marketers and SEO professionals optimize their content, analyze their competitors’ strategies, and plan their own strategies with data-driven insights. \n\nAs each tool has its strengths and limitations, by integrating multiple tools, you can gain a more holistic understanding of your website’s performance and pinpoint areas that require enhancement.",
