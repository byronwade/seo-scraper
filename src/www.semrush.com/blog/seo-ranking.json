  "content": "What Is SEO Ranking?\n\nSEO ranking (search engine optimization ranking) refers to a webpage’s position in search engines’ organic search results for a given search query.\n\nIf your page is higher in search results, more people are likely to see it. Which means more people may visit your site.\n\nFor example, look at Google’s top search results for the keyword “best gaming chairs.”\n\nThe first two results are paid ads. After that, one of PC Gamer’s pages holds the No. 1 organic result. This means PC Gamer has the No. 1 SEO rank on this particular search engine results page (SERP).\n\nAnd it’ll likely receive more traffic than those ranking below.\n\nWhy Are Search Rankings Important?\n\nGetting better rankings for your pages is one of the main goals of SEO. Why? Because it usually results in getting more organic traffic to your website.\n\nTo put it simply: Better rankings = more visitors.\n\nThis also serves your strategic marketing and business goals, such as:\n\nIncreased brand awareness: Higher search rankings make your website more visible, allowing more people to discover and learn about your business. This boosts brand recognition and trust over time.\nMore sales: More visitors naturally leads to more sales and conversions, as a percentage of those visitors will likely purchase your products or services\nLower customer acquisition costs: Organic traffic is essentially free, especially compared to other paid advertising channels. Higher organic traffic volumes lower your overall cost of acquiring customers over the lifetime of your business.\n\nBecause of all these benefits, having higher search rankings is extremely important today.\n\nHow to See Your SEO Rankings\n\nBefore you learn how search engines rank pages and how you can improve your own rankings, you need to know where you currently stand.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen you understand where you presently rank for important keywords, you create a baseline to measure progress against. \n\nWithout knowing your starting point, you can't set proper goals or quantify the impact of optimizations.\n\nThere are two main ways to check your current search engine rankings in Google.\n\nCheck Google SERPs\n\nThe most direct way is to simply search for your target keywords in Google and see where your pages appear in the results.\n\nThis shows you the actual live ranking position. However, manually checking rankings this way is very time-consuming and inefficient.\n\nThat’s why it’s better to use a software tool that can track your keyword rankings automatically and provide you with detailed reports and insights.\n\nUse Position Tracking Tool\n\nSemrush’s Position Tracking tool is a robust automated solution for rank tracking.\n\nKey features include:\n\nTrack thousands of keywords on a daily basis\nEmail alerts for ranking changes\nBuilding ranking history databases to spot trends\n\nTo get started, set up a project in the tool and add the keywords you want to track.\n\nOnce done, the tool will show you your current rankings. Just go to the “Overview” tab and scroll down to find the “Rankings overview” section.\n\nCheck Your Current Position on Google\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nAfter you see your current positions, you can think about improving.\n\nTo improve your SEO rankings, you need to first understand how search engines rank pages.\n\nAfter all, if you don't understand what factors search engines use to rank pages, how can you properly optimize your site? \n\nYou'd just be guessing blindly instead of strategizing effectively.\n\nHow Search Engines Rank Pages\n\nTo rank your pages, search engines need to discover them first.\n\nLet’s take a look at how this process works in Google:\n\nCrawling: First, Googlebot (a web crawler) will crawl your site. That means it goes from one page to another and “reads” the content. \nIndexing: Then, Google stores information about your pages in a huge database called the Google index.\nRanking: If the page meets Google’s criteria, it will be served as a search result for relevant search queries.\n\nNote\n\nSince Google has by far the biggest market share, we’ll focus on this search engine in this post. Most of the principles and tips, however, apply to all search engines. \n\nGoogle Ranking Algorithms\n\nYour Google SEO rankings depend solely on the search engine’s algorithms. \n\nGoogle’s algorithms are a set of complex internal processes used by Google to rank pages. \n\nHere are some basic facts we know about Google's algorithms:\n\nGoogle calls these algorithms “ranking systems” \nMany of the ranking systems apply to all search queries\nSome systems are only used for specific types of queries. For example, the product reviews system only applies to the ranking of product review pages.\nThe algorithms take into consideration a huge number of ranking factors and signals \nThe algorithms are being updated constantly. The smaller updates happen on a daily basis. The bigger Google algorithm updates (also called “core” algorithm updates) happen several times a year. \nExamples of Confirmed Ranking Factors\n\nNo one knows exactly all the factors search engines like Google consider when ranking pages. \n\nSome have been confirmed. Some are thought to be factors by most SEO experts (although not officially confirmed). And some are pure speculation.\n\nAll we know for sure is that there are many SEO factors that influence your rankings either directly or indirectly. We’ll discuss some of them below. \n\nOver the years, Google has officially confirmed the importance of several factors. Here are some examples of SEO factors Google has confirmed:\n\nContent relevance: Google determines whether a page is relevant to a search query and ranks the most relevant pages (source)\nContent quality: Google uses various means to identify quality in order to rank pages (source). This includes input from real people and machine learning algorithms. \nBacklinks: Relevant links from other sites help Google identify trustworthiness (namely through the PageRank algorithm), as well as relevance (source, source)\nPhysical proximity: Google considers how far a business is from the searcher's location for local search results (source)\nMobile-friendliness: Pages optimized for mobile devices may rank better in Google's mobile search results (source)\nPage performance: Google uses a set of metrics called Core Web Vitals to determine how well a page performs in terms of speed, responsiveness, and visual stability (source, source)\nHTTPS: Google detects whether a website uses a secured, encrypted connection and gives a slight advantage to those that do (source)\n\nThere are also some negative ranking factors. \n\nThe presence of these on a website may lead to worse rankings or even penalties from Google:\n\nIntrusive pop-ups: Using pop-ups that prevent users from accessing the content on mobile devices (source)\nKeyword stuffing: Using irrelevant keywords or excessive usage of certain keywords (source)\nUnnatural links: Any attempt to manipulate PageRank (including link buying, link exchanges, low-quality links, etc.) (source)\n\nPlease note that these are just examples of ranking signals Google uses. No one knows all of them. Or their exact levels of importance.\n\nGoogle tends to limit information about how exactly their ranking algorithms work. \n\nMainly because the algorithms are their proprietary business information. Also, if all the ranking factors were publicly available, it would be easier to cheat your way to better rankings.\n\nCorrelation vs. Causation\n\nIt’s important to distinguish between correlation and causation in the context of SEO factors. \n\nA high correlation between a certain SEO factor and higher rankings does not necessarily imply causation. \n\nA typical example would be word count. \n\nSome SEO studies have previously observed that pages with more words tend to rank higher. \n\nHowever, it doesn’t necessarily mean that Google uses word count as a direct ranking factor. (In fact, it almost certainly doesn’t.) That being said, long-form content can still help you get better rankings. \n\nMainly because:\n\nIt covers the topic more comprehensively (improving the content’s relevance and quality)\nIt can attract more backlinks (improving the content’s PageRank)\nHow to Improve Your SEO Rankings\n\nTo improve your SEO rankings, we recommend taking a holistic approach to search engine optimization. \n\nDon’t focus on just one factor (for example, getting more backlinks). Instead, take a comprehensive look at all the aspects of your website’s SEO. And try to improve in all the main areas. \n\nLet’s take a look at the basic areas you need to improve in order to rank better.\n\nWe’ll also provide actionable tips on how to use Semrush tools in each step. Feel free to create a free account (no credit card needed) so you can follow along. \n\nConduct Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research is the process of finding and analyzing keywords you want to rank for.\n\nIt will help you pick the most effective keywords, based primarily on the following criteria:\n\nSearch volume: How many times are people searching for the keyword each month, on average? \nKeyword difficulty: How fierce is the competition ranking for the keyword? \nSearch intent: What is the reason users are searching for the keyword?\n\nSearch intent is particularly crucial when it comes to your search rankings. Google pays a lot of attention to the search intent behind each query and tries to serve the most relevant results.\n\nDo users want to navigate to a specific page? Purchase a product? Find a specific piece of information?\n\nSay someone searches, “best flowers for valentine’s day.” This user is doing research and wants to learn what kind of flowers they should purchase.\n\nBut if they search for “valentine’s day flowers near me,” they want to find and purchase flowers.\n\nThe SERPs will differ significantly between these two keywords. While the first keyword returns blog posts about Valentine’s Day flowers, the second SERP features mostly flower shops and flower delivery services.\n\nChoosing the right keywords and understanding the intent behind them will help you ensure your content is relevant to the search queries.\n\nTo conduct keyword research, you’ll need a keyword research tool.\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool will give you both keyword ideas and the metrics mentioned above.\n\nEnter your first keyword into the tool and hit “Search.”\n\nIt can be a general keyword. If you’re doing keyword research for a florist, you might choose “flowers.”\n\nThe tool will then provide thousands of keyword suggestions with additional details for each of them.\n\nThe three key metrics—search intent (“Intent”), search volume (“Volume”), and keyword difficulty (“KD%”)—are also available.\n\nTo narrow down the results, use filters.\n\nFor example, you can choose to only show keywords that are in the form of a question. Or keywords that have at least 500 monthly searches. Or keywords with transactional search intent. Or all of the above at once.\n\nYou can further explore the keyword groups and subgroups that will help you identify the most common topics within your niche and help you map your keywords. \n\nRead our detailed guide to keyword research to learn more about the process. \n\nDo Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nCreate Quality Content\n\nContent quality is at the heart of SEO. In most niches, the competition is so fierce that you won’t rank well at all if your content is just average.\n\nYour content has to be great. \n\nBut how do you define quality content?\n\nFirst, your content has to be comprehensive. This means it answers all the questions a user may have about the target topic.\n\nLet’s say a user searches for “bonsai tree care.” \n\nOf course, they want to know the basics. Like how often to water the tree and which fertilizers to use. \n\nBut they’ll probably also appreciate it if the post answers some further questions. Like when repotting is needed or what the difference is between caring for indoor and outdoor trees.\n\nA great way to ensure your content stands out is to analyze your competitors.\n\nEnter your target keyword into Semrush’s SEO Content Template tool to get an overview of the SERP for any location. \n\nThen, explore the top-ranking pages:\n\nClick the links to the best-performing competitors’ pages and see how they covered the topic.\n\nYou’ll also get a list of semantically related keywords. This can help you see to what extent your competitors have covered your target topic. By seeing the most common related keywords they used.\n\nSecondly, your content has to be reliable. \n\nGoogle employs thousands of people—called Quality Raters—who go through the search results and rate pages based on Google’s quality guidelines.\n\nWithin these guidelines, Google defines a set of signals commonly referred to as E-E-A-T. The acronym stands for:\n\nExperience: You should demonstrate relevant, firsthand experience with the subject matter \nExpertise: You should be an expert in the field you write about\nAuthoritativeness: Your website should be an authoritative source (ideally mentioned on other authoritative websites in your niche) \nTrustworthiness: Your website should demonstrate trust (citing sources, using author credentials, etc.)\n\nAlthough the input by Quality Raters does not impact rankings directly, it is used to feed Google’s systems to recognize quality content better. \n\nHigh-quality content should be unique, too. It means providing all (or at least some) of the following:\n\nOriginal angle\nOriginal data (studies, polls, etc.)\nOriginal media (illustrations, videos, etc.)\nOriginal examples\n\nUnique content will demonstrate quality to Google, but there’s another benefit: It can also help you attract backlinks naturally. (More on backlinks in the next section.)\n\nYour content should also be up to date. In fact, content freshness can be a ranking factor for time-sensitive queries.\n\nLast but not least, great content must be easy to read. \n\nMost people just scan through webpages nowadays. Make sure your content is structured in a way that is easy to skim.\n\nYou can check your content’s readability with Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant. This tool will analyze your content and provide scores and recommendations for these four categories:\n\nReadability: Provides readability score, recommends word count, and suggests improvements\nSEO: Checks for relevant keyword usage and highlights some on-page issues (missing alt text, broken links, etc.)\nTone of voice: Analyzes the tone of the text, checks for consistency, and lists most formal and most casual sentences \nOriginality: Checks your text for any signs of plagiarism\n\nType your text directly into the tool or import existing text from the web. You can also use the SEO Writing Assistant as a Google Docs or Microsoft Office extension, as well as a WordPress plugin.\n\nThis will allow you to edit your text and get recommendations in real time, directly in your preferred editor.\n\nLet’s say the tone of voice of your text is too formal. Simply click on “Tone of voice” in the sidebar navigation. And scroll down to review the list of “Most formal sentences” provided by the tool.\n\nIf you click a sentence in the list, the tool will show you where it appears in your text. And you can rewrite it to sound more casual.\n\nThe SEO Writing Assistant will immediately reflect the changes in the updated analysis results.\n\nUse All These Content Optimization Tools\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →\nGet Quality Backlinks\n\nBacklinks have helped Google rank pages since the very beginning. \n\nThe idea behind backlinks as an indicator of quality is simple:\n\nIf many high-authority pages link to your page, it’s a good indication that your page is also a reliable, high-quality source. \n\nAnd Google will reward you with higher rankings for that.\n\nThere are many ways you can get more backlinks. (This process is called link building.) But you need to be careful—Google prohibits any link manipulation​​, especially buying links. \n\nA good way to start is to look at your competitors’ backlinks. \n\nJust enter your domain and the domains of your top competitors in the Backlink Gap tool. Then, hit “Find prospects.”\n\nIn a matter of seconds, you’ll be able to see domains that link to your competitors (but not you).\n\nYou can then explore specific pages that contain backlinks to your competitors. Then save these pages for email outreach.\n\nJust select the domain by checking the box next to it and clicking the “Start outreach” button in the top-right corner.\n\nThis will move the backlink prospects to the Link Building Tool, where you can manage your email outreach. \n\nTo dive deeper into this technique, read our step-by-step guide on how to replicate the backlinks of your competitors.\n\nBuild Quality Backlinks\n\nwith the Backlink Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nImprove Your Technical SEO\n\nTechnical SEO means optimizing all the technical aspects of your website. Its main goal is to ensure Google and other search engines can crawl and index your website correctly. \n\nHere are a few main categories of technical SEO:\n\nImproving site architecture and navigation\nSpeeding up your website\nEnsuring mobile-friendliness\nUsing correct on-page SEO elements\nFixing common issues (like duplicate content, HTTP issues, redirect errors, etc.)\n\nWe recommend conducting a complete technical SEO audit to identify the most serious issues.\n\nSemrush’s Site Audit tool can help with that.\n\nOnce you create your project and set up the first crawl, you’ll get a complete overview of your website’s overall health.\n\nYou can then explore various aspects of your technical SEO through the “Thematic Reports”:\n\nOr simply switch to the “Issues” tab. Here, you’ll see all the issues the tool has detected on your site.\n\nGo through them and start fixing them one by one. The issues are listed in order of their severity—so you can start at the top with the “Errors.”\n\nBesides the list of affected pages for each issue, you’ll also get a description and tips on how to fix it. Just click the “Why and how to fix it” link next to the name of the issue.\n\nFor more information, read our detailed guide on how to conduct a technical SEO audit. \n\nImprove Your Technical SEO\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nMonitor Your Progress\n\nNow that you’ve made several efforts to improve your SEO rankings, it's important to continuously monitor your progress.\n\nThis will help you understand whether your efforts are yielding results. Or if you need to adjust strategy.\n\nUse Semrush’s Position Tracking tool to monitor ranking of your keywords.\n\nOpen the tool.\n\nYou can either create a new project or use an existing project. To create a new project, click the “+ Create project” button in the top-right corner.\n\nThen, enter your domain and the project name.\n\nOnce you’ve created a project, you can set up the tracking. \n\nChoose campaign settings for the following in the “Targeting” section:\n\nSearch engine (Google or Baidu)\nDevice (mobile or desktop)\nTarget location\nLanguage\n\nAnd then click “Continue To Keywords → .”\n\nIn the “Keywords” section, you'll enter the keywords you want to monitor. You can do that manually or import the list.\n\nOnce you’ve entered all your keywords, hit the “Start Tracking” button. (Of course, you can add new keywords to the tracking anytime in the future.)\n\nIn the “Landscape” report, the tool will provide a detailed analysis of your overall progress. As well as key metrics and the rankings distribution chart. \n\nThe “Overview” tab will track your rankings over time—for overall search visibility and individual keywords. \n\nYou can dive deeper by exploring the tool's various reports. \n\nFor example, the “Competitors Discovery” report will allow you to analyze your top organic search competitors, add them to your tracking, and see how your rankings compare for popular keywords.\n\nLast but not least, you can set up alerts to stay informed about any significant changes in your rankings.\n\nJust click the little bell icon in the top-right corner and set up your first trigger. For example, you could get a notification every time one of your keywords leaves the top three positions.\n\nRead our detailed guide to learn more about Google keyword ranking.\n\nMonitor Your Ranking Progress\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
