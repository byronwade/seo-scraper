  "content": "What Is the Google Display Network?\n\nThe Google Display Network (GDN) is a group of millions of websites, apps, and videos where Google ads can appear.\n\nHere’s what a display ad can look like on the GDN:\n\nCollectively, the GDN reaches a huge percentage of internet users worldwide. \n\nYou can use a type of Google ads called display ads to serve your ads on the Google Display Network. And reach millions of potential customers. \n\nWhy Use the GDN?\n\nThe Google Display Network offers immense reach for marketers. \n\nBecause it places ads on such a wide range of websites and platforms, the GDN can be an effective way to reach broad, diverse audiences.\n\nYou’ll reach people who aren’t necessarily looking for your products or services in search results.\n\nNearly every website and blog has content that relates to at least one of your target keywords.\n\nAnd the GDN can serve ads to such websites and blogs.\n\nIt’s a great way to increase brand visibility and awareness. And drive sales. \n\nNote\n\nBefore you start a GDN campaign, use a digital ad intelligence tool like AdClarity to reveal competitor digital ad activities, ad spend, and key performance metrics.\n\nHow Does the Google Display Network Work? \n\nThe GDN can serve your online ads on sites, apps, or videos related to your business. And to users who match the specific criteria you define. \n\nLet’s see how it works in more detail.\n\nAudience Targeting Based on Interests\n\nInterest targeting lets you show your ads to people interested in your products or services. \n\nOr those who engage in activities related to your business. \n\nYou can choose from three main interest-targeting categories: \n\nAffinity Audiences\nCustom Affinity Audiences\nIn-Market Audiences\nAffinity Audiences\n\nThis category includes 80 different groups based on interests. Such as “running enthusiasts,” “action movie lovers,” or “book lovers.” \n\nYou can show your ads to one or more of these audiences. \n\nThere isn’t a limit to the number of affinities you can add. However, the more you add, the more targeted your audience and the smaller your reach (possible impressions).\n\nCustom Affinity Audiences\n\nYou can narrow your targeting further by using search terms (called keywords) to create your custom audiences.\n\nFor example, if you’re running GDN ads for your triathlon gear store, you can use keywords like “triathlon training,” “beginner triathletes,” or “triathlon events.” \n\nGoogle will show your ads to people visiting sites that contain those keywords. \n\nYou can even add specific URLs your audience might visit. And target sites where you’d like your ad to appear.\n\nIn this case, that could be triathlete.com or ironman.com. \n\nLike this:\n\nIn-Market Audiences\n\nThis targeting category lets you find people actively looking at products or services similar to yours. \n\nIt’s useful if you’re looking to drive awareness among those “in-market” to buy. Aka people with high purchase intent. \n\nUsing the same example, these might be people who have added triathlon gear to their shopping cart on another website.\n\nOr even those who’ve watched product review or comparison videos.\n\nAudience Targeting Based on Demographics\n\nDemographic targeting lets you reach potential customers who are of a certain age, gender, parental status, or household income. \n\nAnd you can combine demographic targeting with interest targeting to reach a narrower, more relevant audience.\n\nFor example, let’s say you own a yoga studio for women. And you want to promote a special class for working mothers.\n\nYou can focus on the “Female” demographic group, within the “25-54” age range, and specify “Parent” status. Along with affinity groups based on yoga, pilates, and fitness. \n\nBe mindful that the more specific your targeting, the fewer people will see your ads. Test several targeting combinations to see which brings you the most conversions. \n\nGoogle Display Network vs. Google Search Network\n\nThe main difference between the Google Display Network and the Google Search Network is where your ads show up. \n\nThe Google Search Network is a collection of websites and apps related to Google Search where your ads can appear. \n\nYour Google Search Network ads can show in Google search results and other Google partner search sites when people search for phrases related to your keywords. \n\nLike this:\n\nWith the Google Ads Display Network, however, your ads show up while people are visiting other sites, apps, and videos. \n\nYou might not always reach folks actively searching for what you offer. \n\nLike this:\n\nThere are other noticeable differences. \n\nFor example, with the Search Network, advertisers target keywords. \n\nBut in the Display Network, they target audiences, interests, and websites. \n\nPlus, the Search Network tends to be best at capturing higher-intent audiences. \n\nWhereas the Display Network is better for brand awareness. \n\nHere’s a visual to illustrate the main differences between the two:\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhat’s Google Advertising? A Guide to Google Ads\nHow Much Does It Cost to Use the Google Display Network?\n\nThe average cost per click on the Display Network is less than $1. But the total cost will ultimately depend on your budget. \n\nThe GDN runs on a live auction system like the Google Search Network. And charges you every time someone clicks on your ads. \n\nThe great thing about GDN is that there’s generally less competition for keyword bids. \n\nSo, you’re more likely to reach users interested in your products or services. And although the intent may not be as strong, you get more impressions. \n\nWhich is what advertisers often turn to GDN for: awareness.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nHow to Skyrocket Profit on Google Ads (6 Best Ways)\nHow to Create Google Display Ads\n\nTo create a display campaign and run your ads on the Display Network, you’ll need to go through your Google Ads account. \n\nIn the left-hand menu, select “Campaigns” and hit the plus button. Then, click “New campaign.”\n\nNext, choose your goal. \n\nIf you don’t have one yet, click “Create a campaign without a goal's guidance.”\n\nThen, select “Display” as the campaign type. \n\nNow add your URL, enter a name for your campaign, and click “Continue.” \n\nThen, you’ll be prompted to: \n\nChoose your location and language to target \nSet your budget and bidding strategy\nAdd audience-targeting parameters\nCreate ad copy and upload visuals\nReview and publish\n\nPro tip\n\nUse AdCreative.ai to create high-converting display ads and professional-quality product photos with artificial intelligence.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhat Are Display Ads? Display Advertising Explained\nGoogle Keyword Planner: How to Use It to Find Keywords\nHow to Optimize Your Ads for the Google Display Network\n\nUse the following guidelines to create optimized, responsive Display Network ads.\n\n(Responsive display ads are the default ad type for GDN.)\n\nGoogle will ask you to submit your assets (e.g., headlines, logos, images, and descriptions). And it’ll automatically adjust everything to fit different devices and available ad space.\n\nFollow these best practices to create ads that reach users and drive performance:\n\nStick to Google’s Image Size Guidelines\n\nImages are one of the most important elements of display ads. They help users understand your business, products, and brand. \n\nAnd getting image sizing right is crucial for your ads to perform well. \n\nYou can upload up to 15 images in three aspect ratios: square, landscape, and portrait. Or you can choose from Google’s free stock image library. \n\nLike this:\n\nGoogle lets you set the ratio of the images you select from their library.\n\nIf you upload your images, follow these size guidelines: \n\nSquare images\n\nRatio: 1:1\n\nRecommended size: 1200 x 1200 \n\nMinimum size: 300 x 300\n\nLandscape images\n\nRatio: 1.91:1\n\nRecommended size: 1200 x 628\n\nMinimum size: 600 x 314\n\nPortrait images\n\nRatio: 9:16\n\nRecommended size: 900 x 1600\n\nMinimum size: 600 x 1067\n\nNote\n\nAll images have a maximum file size of 5120 KB. \n\nMake Sure Your Images Are High Quality\n\nYou want your images to be the right size, but you also want to ensure they’re high quality. \n\nFor best results, avoid images that are blurry, excessively filtered, upside-down, and outlined with a border.\n\nDon’t:\n\nOverlay your logo on top of an image\nOverlay text or other graphics\nOverlay buttons \nUse logos with colorful backgrounds\n\nDo:\n\nUse single images (no collages)\nMake your product or service the centerpiece \nUse physical settings with natural shadows and lighting\nUse logos with transparent or white backgrounds\nFollow Google’s Text Recommendations\n\nThe most important guideline for your text is to use clear and simple language to describe your product or service. \n\nAnd avoid generic text, all caps, and clickbait at all costs. \n\nShort Headlines\n\nYou can add up to five short headlines in responsive display ads.\n\nDon’t:\n\nPunctuate the end of short headlines\nUse the same copy in a headline and description\nUse your business’s name as the headline\nUse all caps\n\nDo:\n\nTell users what they can do: “Pay with a credit card”\nSpell out your offer: “Free next-day delivery”\nMake it unique and compelling: “Running shoes for less”\n\nKeep all short headlines under 30 characters, or Google might cut them off. And make sure all your assets are unique.\n\nLong Headlines\n\nYou can add one long headline for your responsive display ads.\n\nDescribe your brand’s or product’s value proposition in a compelling way. Make it useful and interesting. \n\nDon’t:\n\nPunctuate the end of your long headline\nRepeat the copy from your short headlines\nUse all caps\nUse clickbait\n\nDo:\n\nWrite your headline so it can stand alone. Google may show it without description text.\n\nKeep your long headline under 90 characters to avoid any cutoffs. \n\nDescriptions\n\nGoogle shows descriptions alongside short headlines. Not long headlines. \n\nSo, write your description copy to complement your short headlines.\n\nYou’re allowed to add up to five descriptions. Our recommendation? Add all five.\n\nDon’t:\n\nUse generic messaging\nUse all caps\nUse clickbait\n\nDo:\n\nMake text easy to read and understand\nUse sentence-case capitalization\nUse detail\nClearly articulate the value proposition\n\nKeep your descriptions under 90 characters to avoid cutoffs in certain layouts. \n\nUnderstanding what the Google ad network is and how it works is only the first step. \n\nIf you want to see returns, you need to take things a step further. \n\nThat means looking at your competitors. Uncovering their ads, ad spend, and display network strategies. \n\nAnd building on those insights.\n\nFor example, a tool like AdClarity can help you:\n\nAnalyze your competitors’ digital campaigns (in detail)\nUnderstand where (and how much) your competitors are spending on ads\nCompare (and benchmark) competitor strategies with your own\nSee what the best-performing advertisers are doing\n\nAnd more. From a database of 650,000 advertisers in 50-plus global markets.\n\nAfter you’ve learned about your competitors’ ads, leverage an audience intelligence tool. \n\nIt’ll help you get insights into your audience’s online behavior, personalize your messaging, identify top promotional channels, and more.\n\nCreate a free Semrush account to try AdClarity and Audience Intelligence. \n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
