  "content": "What if you could feature your business on Google for free anytime you like?\n\nThat’s what Google Business Profile (GBP) posts (formerly Google My Business or GMB posts) let you do. \n\nGBP posts are quick updates that allow business owners to share news, offers, and product details directly on their Google page. \n\nThey pop up on Google Search and Google Maps, giving customers the latest information on your business.\n\nYou can post about:\n\nAn unmissable deal \nAn upcoming event \nProduct highlights\n\nIn this blog post, we discuss how to create posts that keep customers engaged on your Google profile, boost local search rankings, and grow foot traffic to your stores. \n\nWhere Do Google Business Profiles Show Up and What Do They Look Like?\n\nYour Google Business Profile is like a digital snapshot of your business. Appearing when people look your company up on Google Search or Maps. \n\nIf you search for “yoga classes NYC USA” in Google, here’s what shows up:\n\nWhen you click on a yoga studio from the above list, you’ll land on its Google Business Profile page. \n\nWhere you’ll see all the relevant details in one spot—including photos, reviews, and posts from the business.\n\nFurther reading: ‘How Do I Add My Business to Google?’ A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nGoogle Business Profile posts are like mini advertisements or bulletins. \n\nGoing back to our example, yoga businesses can use them to alert patrons about additional classes, introduce a new instructor, or provide details about workshops. \n\nHere’s why GBP posts matter:\n\nShow and tell: Posts can include attention-grabbing text, photos, or videos—perfect for brand storytelling. Plus share timely, regular updates on what’s new and upcoming to draw more customers in and keep them informed.\nGet noticed: Profile posts are valuable because they appear on your company’s Google page, where users are already looking. Your business can attract more eyeballs for longer with well-crafted, engaging post content.\n4 Types of Google Business Profile Posts\n\nThe four main types of GBP posts are updates, offers, events, and product-related. Let’s take a closer look at each of these, outlining when and how to use them. \n\n1. Update Post\n\nAn update post informs customers about your latest news or changes to your business. \n\nLet’s take the update post on the City University of New York (CUNY)’s GBP as an example. \n\nIt lists the types of degree programs it offers and extends an open invitation to events during CUNY Month.\n\nNote\n\nGoogle may not approve posts that contain phone numbers, preferring users to contact businesses via the information provided in the GBP business listing. This helps ensure a consistent and secure user experience. Read more about GBP’s content policy here.\n\n2. Offer Post\n\nA GBP offer post is a great way to promote your limited-edition products, special deals and discounts, or sales events. \n\nThe Pie Hole’s “Death by Chocolate” desserts offer a great example of content you could share in an offer post. \n\nSee how the California-based pie and coffee business announced final orders for its seasonal specials:\n\nGrab your audience’s attention to limited-edition or seasonal products, discounts on bestsellers, or special deals exclusive to loyal customers.\n\n3. Event Post\n\nImagine you’re hosting an upcoming gala opening, a musical evening, or a seminar. Promoting it with an event post on GBP can encourage greater participation. \n\nTreat these messages as virtual invitations. Share all the event details, including the date, time, location, and what attendees can expect. \n\nHere’s an example of a click-through event post for a Halloween event:\n\nThe UK theme park Pleasurewood Chills didn’t just use an event post as an invitation. It added a timeline to create FOMO (fear of missing out) and a timely sense of urgency—an effective strategy to capture its audience’s interest. \n\nYou’ll potentially increase click-through rates (CTR) as viewers feel compelled to act quickly. \n\nThe CTR metric gauges the frequency at which users click on your link when Google serves your post to searchers. Reflecting immediate user engagement with your content in real-time. \n\nNote\n\nA higher CTR often means your post is making more people interested and likely to take action—boosting site visits and conversions as a result.\n\n4. Product Post\n\nProduct posts provide visitors with a visual representation of your product or service offerings.\n\nLet’s take health and wellness brand Nicholas Brooklyn. Its product posts showcase items with prices included to promote transparency and visibility.\n\nUse product posts to spotlight:\n\nNew additions to your range\nYour most popular products\nServices that make your business stand out\n\nPro tip\n\nHigh-impact quality images grab attention and show off your products. Clear descriptions explain what you offer. Storytelling connects with customers so they’re more likely to engage with your business. Together, these elements make your product posts stand out and encourage actions—such as visiting your store and purchasing.\n\n10 GBP Post Ideas for Your Business\n\nHere are 10 ideas for creating eye-catching Google Business Profile posts to boost your engagement and conversion potential. \n\n1. Special Offers and Discounts\n\nEveryone loves a good deal, and special offers or limited-time coupon codes create immediate interest. These types of posts can help you drive higher conversion rates. \n\nCreate a sense of urgency through promotions with specified end dates, such as flash sales or exclusive limited-time discounts. \n\nA good example is when Dunkin’ Donuts announced a special $1 donut offer when purchasing a medium or large coffee.\n\n2. Street View, 360° Views, and Virtual Tours\n\nIntegrating various visual experiences into your Google Business Profile (GBP) can enhance audience engagement. Each type of visual offers a unique perspective of your business.\n\nFor example, we used the virtual tour enhancement to give a quick peek into our Semrush office:\n\nAlthough you can’t embed such visuals directly into GBP posts, here are some ways to reference and promote these features:\n\nCreate a GBP post referring to your visuals: Craft a post that encourages viewers to check out your 360° View or Virtual Tour. For example, by announcing a new virtual tour available on your profile and inviting customers to explore it.\nInclude a call to action (CTA): Invite users to visit your GBP listing to experience your Virtual Tour or view 360° imagery with a compelling CTA that directs them to where they can find these features.\nUse engaging images: Use captivating static images related to your different visual views in your GBP posts. Like including a well-shot photo from your Virtual Tour as a teaser.\nRegular updates: Keep your audience engaged with regular GBP posts on new or updated Virtual Tours, plus posts highlighting different aspects of your 360° Views.\n\nAnd here are these four tips in practice:\n\n3. New Products or Services\n\nRegularly updating your audience about new products or services is not just about sharing information but a strategy to engage customers and encourage them to revisit your business. \n\nFor example, a new yoga class pricing package.\n\nThe update post from Hot Yoga Chelsea serves a dual purpose. It informs the existing customer base about new options and attracts potential customers looking for flexible pricing.\n\n4. Reviews and Customer Stories\n\nWhile directly posting Google reviews as a GBP post isn’t possible, you can creatively capture their essence and communicate user experiences with your audience. \n\nRepurpose Google reviews with relatable narratives and authentic customer experiences into GBP posts. Positive, real-world experiences are highly likely to validate your value proposition and foster trust. \n\nHere are some ideas for crafting engaging GBP posts inspired by customer stories and reviews.\n\nThematic roundup posts: Use themes or positive sentiments from your reviews to create roundup posts. Like a post highlighting customer service excellence or product quality as described in your reviews.\nSuccess stories inspired by reviews: Share customer success stories or experiences that align with the positive feedback in your reviews. While not direct quotes, these narratives can echo the feedback expressed by your customers.\nEncouraging review exploration: Create posts that encourage potential customers to read your Google reviews for a comprehensive understanding of what makes your business unique.\n\nHere’s an example of how to use a customer testimonial to craft a GBP post summarizing a positive brand experience.\n\nThis approach indirectly highlights the positive feedback while adhering to GBP’s guidelines. It can be a creative way to communicate customer satisfaction while enhancing your GBP presence.\n\n5. User-Generated Content (UGC)\n\nUsing user-generated content (UGC) in your GBP posts can be an effective way to showcase your brand’s authenticity. And to connect with current and potential customers. \n\nUGC—including customer reviews, photos, and experiences—can offer a genuine perspective on your products or services.\n\nFurther reading: How User-Generated Content Can Help Your Content Strategy\n\nTo incorporate UGC into your GBP posts:\n\nEncourage more UGC: Use GBP posts to encourage customers to share their content. Invite customers to share photos of their experiences with your products or services—then reuse the customer content in future posts.\nCelebrate UGC contributions: Acknowledge and thank customers who contribute to UGC, showing appreciation for their engagement. This can foster a sense of community and encourage further participation.\n\nConsider a restaurant, which has successfully attracted patrons through customer-shared images. \n\nWhile direct posting of customer images to GBP isn’t possible, it could create engaging posts that encourage more customer contributions. \n\nFor instance, it might create a roundup post using UGC food images titled, “5 Times We Considered Hiring Our Customers as Our Photographers.” \n\nThis approach not only showcases customer contributions, but also adds a fun and personal touch to the restaurant’s GBP presence.\n\nNote\n\nGoogle can limit UGC-like photos and reviews for places because of abuse or irrelevant content. Restrictions may be short-term or long-term and may affect all or specific types of UGC. Check the Google Maps User Contributed Policy for details.\n\n6. Seasonal Content\n\nEmbrace seasonal trends and holiday spirit in your GBP posts so your business remains relevant throughout the year. \n\nCreate timely content that resonates with your audience’s current interests by sharing special promotions, events, or seasonal offerings.\n\nSeasonal content isn’t just limited to specific holidays. It also reflects yearly changes—think fall, summer, and winter time. Align your promotions and messaging with the mood and activities typical of each season.\n\nAmerican coffeehouse chain Blank Street Coffee used this strategy to announce its winter specials. \n\nSuch seasonal connections can renew interest and make your brand part of customer traditions.\n\n7. Educational Posts\n\nDemonstrate your industry knowledge and skills by sharing informative content, educational posts, tips, and advice relevant to your sector. \n\nThis practice can establish your brand as an authority in your field. It may also build trust with your audience, and set you apart from competitors.\n\nFor example, UK-based bathroom retailer Royal Bathrooms sets itself apart by sharing expert tips with the community on GBP. \n\nGoogle values content that demonstrates expertise and authoritativeness. You too can improve your business’s visibility in search results by sharing similar content in your GBP posts.\n\n8. Changes to Your Business\n\nIt’s important to always keep your audience informed on business changes. Whether it’s new opening hours, relocations, or policy changes.\n\nSomething as simple as sharing the latest menu at your coffee shop can pique customer curiosity and potentially increase in-store visits. \n\nIn this GBP post, coffee company Roasting Plant keeps its customers updated by sharing the changes made to its pricing. \n\n9. Showcase Achievements\n\nLooking to build trust in your brand? Highlight your big business wins directly on your GBP.\n\nPost your victories and share customer success stories to help you grow your credibility across Google Search and Google Maps. \n\nA well-crafted GBP post featuring your milestones will indicate quality and reliability. It tells potential clients, “We deliver results.”\n\nBelow, law firm Morgan & Morgan celebrates a substantial verdict win, spotlighting its team’s dedication and hard work. \n\nIt’s not just about the numbers, but also a valuable message of commitment and justice.\n\n10. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nUse your GBP as a platform to address questions people might have during their customer journey. Providing helpful answers will potentially eliminate barriers to conversion.\n\nYour audience should then have an easier time connecting with your brand, understanding your products, and eventually buying. \n\nThis is how you go about addressing customer FAQs:\n\nIdentify common questions: Collaborate with your customer service or sales team to pinpoint frequent queries and common pain points.\nAnswer them in purposely crafted GBP posts: Use these insights to communicate clear, helpful answers concerning a product feature or service process, for instance.\nEnhance connection and understanding: Create GBP posts that make it easier for your audience to connect with your brand and understand your offerings. Which may lead to increased sales.\n\nHere’s an example of how to seem approachable and responsive to consumer needs:\n\nWhile it might have a dedicated FAQ section, its GBP post covering a commonly asked question demonstrates an eagerness to meet customer needs.\n\nHow to Schedule GBP Posts\n\nNow that you have some great Google My Business post examples, let’s discuss how to schedule them.\n\nThe process done right ensures consistency. And while Google Business Profile doesn’t support scheduling, you can use third-party social media scheduling platforms to automate publishing. \n\nSocial Poster, part of Semrush’s Social Media tool, allows you to: \n\nPlan ahead: Set specific dates and times for your GBP post contributions\nManage multiple messages: Organize different types of messages for your profile efficiently\nAnalyze their effectiveness: Find out how your messages impact customer engagement and fine-tune them accordingly\nCollaborate with teams: Work together with your relevant team members to create relevant and valuable GBP content\nRespond to reviews: Promptly manage Google customer reviews and engage with your audience\n\nThis helps maintain a constant online presence and saves you precious time.

To register, use an email and password or your Google account credentials. \n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign up Now →\n\nOnce logged in, select the “Social Media” drop-down from the left-hand navigation bar. You may have to scroll down.

Each location has its own specific GBP listing.\n\nTick the GBP locations you want to connect to your Social Poster and click “Add profiles.”\n\nYou’re all set to start scheduling your GBP posts.\n\nThe Social Poster tool offers connectivity with multiple social platforms alongside Google Business Profile.

Effective optimization ensures your posts are crafted to maximize visibility and engagement from the outset. \n\nBusinesses that don’t consider this usually end up asking, Why are our brand’s Google My Business posts not working? \n\nThis can be frustrating, but thankfully, you know that optimizing your posts is the answer to start seeing results.\n\nEnhance your GBP posts for maximum visibility and engagement with the below tips.\n\n1. Words\n\nUse keywords to enhance your business profile’s visibility and search rankings, but don’t make your posts too long. \n\nInclude keywords that are relevant to your business and audience. They should naturally fit into the content, reflecting the terms potential customers might use when searching for your services or products.\n\nThere’s a 1,500-character limit, but that doesn’t mean your posts need to reach full capacity every time. \n\nWhile it’s tempting to use up all the available space, keeping your message short and to the point can attract customers’ attention more effectively. \n\nTip\n\nFor effective SEO, add relevant keywords throughout your GBP—not just your posts. Our step-by-step guide shows you how to do it effectively. \n\nIn the example below, a yoga business effectively targets the keyword “meditation workshop” in its offer post. \n\nImage Source: Google for Small Business\n\nThe keyword choice not only caters to those searching for exact-match and related keywords like “meditation classes.” It also aims to reach audiences using long-tail, high-intent keywords like “meditation workshop near me.” \n\nA keyword-focused strategy within a succinct post has the potential to broaden your reach while maintaining clarity and relevance.\n\nFurther reading: What Is Keyword Intent & How to Align Keywords with User Needs\n\nCustomers on Google seek quick facts, clear answers, and simple explanations. \n\nAccording to a Nielsen Norman Group report, people are likely to scan content for the information they need. They seek quick answers and no longer want to invest time or effort online. \n\nEffective communication starts with word choice. Strive for a balance: be concise yet informative. \n\nCraft your GBP posts so they’re engaging and action-driven—like a concise Google Ad. This approach can significantly increase customer interaction and conversions. \n\n2. Images\n\nImages can be powerful. And the choice and quality of your images in your Google Business Profile (GBP) posts can significantly influence user engagement. \n\nPosting professional photos across your GBP can potentially lead to increased website clicks. \n\nSo, remember to select images that align well with each GBP post you publish. Focus on:\n\nRelevance: Choose images that directly relate to the content of your post. Whether it’s showcasing a new product, highlighting a special offer, or promoting an event, the image should complement and reinforce your message.\nQuality: High-quality, clear, well-lit photos make your post more appealing. Ensure your images reflect true-to-life colors, and avoid heavy editing or excessive filters.\nA professional look: Consider using professional photos wherever possible to elevate the perceived quality of your products or services.\n\nConsider Royal Bathrooms’ use of professional photos in its GBP posts to highlight one of its collections. \n\nHigh-quality images offer a crisp, attractive depiction of their premium bathroom fixtures. Simultaneously enticing potential customers to explore further and contributing to the brand’s visual appeal.\n\nFor optimal display on Google, adhere to GBP photo specifications across your profile and posts.\n\n3. Videos\n\nGBP video posts can be invaluable for generating interest in your brand. \n\nVideos that tell your story or showcase customer testimonials can drive higher engagement on your page. So create concise, captivating videos to introduce your business, products, or services. \n\nNew York’s Ray’s Candy Store does this quite often. In one video, it ties in Valentine’s Day with the idea of candy made with love.\n\nTo insert videos into your posts, comply with the following GBP criteria:\n\nLength: No longer than 30 seconds\nMaximum file size: 75 MB\nMinimum resolution: 720 pixels\n4. Links\n\nIncorporating relevant links in your Google Business Profile (GBP) posts is a strategic way to engage users and encourage specific actions. These links can be a powerful tool to direct customers to more information, drive sales, and promote events directly from your posts.\n\nHere are ways to links effectively in your GBP posts:\n\nWebsite navigation: Add links that lead visitors to your website for detailed information about your business, services, or products\nProduct discovery: Direct customers to specific product pages for browsing and purchasing, enhancing the shopping experience\nEvent registration: Use links to guide users to event signup pages, boosting participation in upcoming events or promotions\n\nEach link in your GBP post should serve as a clear CTA. \n\nFor instance, phrases like ‘Shop Now’, ‘Learn More’, or ‘Sign Up Today’ can be linked to relevant pages, making it easier for customers to take the desired action.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat types of businesses can use the GBP posts feature?\n\nAlmost any kind of business can use Google Business Profile posts. This includes places like pizza shops, clothing stores, and even plumbers. \n\nIf your business can be listed on Google, you can share posts. \n\nGoogle wants to help customers find all sorts of businesses, big or small, no matter what they do or sell. GBP posts provide a way for you to tell your story and connect with people looking for what you offer.\n\nWhat should I post on my GBP?\n\nGBP lets you showcase your business in many ways. Here are some post ideas to keep your profile fresh and engaging:\n\nSay hi with a quick update\nShow off your new product, service, or office photos\nShare valuable customer reviews that make you proud\nAnnounce special or limited-time offers\nSpread the word about upcoming events\nAnswer questions people frequently ask\nIf you run a restaurant outlet, add food and beverage menus\n\nThe key is to make sure your messages are relevant and engaging to your audience. \n\nGoogle prioritizes profiles that are exclusively centered on business activities. For more information on Google’s content policies, refer to the official guidelines.\n\nHow long do GBP posts appear for?\n\nGoogle Business Profile (GBP) posts have an extended visibility period, so they remain active on your profile for six months. Which gives businesses a considerable time frame to engage with their audience and showcase important updates.\n\nNote\n\nFor the most current information on post visibility and any recent changes to GBP policies, refer directly to Google’s Support Page for GBP Posts. \n\nAfter this period, they no longer appear in your profile’s primary GBP section where customers can easily see them. However, they don’t just disappear—they are archived. This means you can still find and see your old posts. \n\nTo look at them again, go into your GBP dashboard and find a section for “Posts.” There, you’ll see all your old and new posts.\n\nCustomers can also click “View previous updates on Google” to see your past posts. \n\nHow can I measure the effectiveness of my GBP posts? \n\nThe short answer is you can’t—at least not at this time. Google does not provide specific analytics for each post. \n\nInstead, businesses should focus on monitoring their overall GBP performance for insights into online engagement and customer interactions. \n\nThe “Performance” tab in GBP lets you evaluate metrics like search queries, device usage, calls, messages, bookings, direction requests, and website clicks. Collectively, these offer a comprehensive view of your GBP’s impact.\n\nSemrush’s Listing Management—specifically its Map Rank Tracker app—can help you gauge the effectiveness of your GBP efforts. \n\nMonitor changes in your profile’s visibility and rankings, plus how you fare against competitors for keywords. To gain a more nuanced understanding of how your posts contribute to your local SEO strategy.\n\nIncrease Your Local Visibility\n\nwith the Listing Management Tool\n\nGet Free Report →\nCan you preview your GBP posts to see how they’ll look on different devices and browsers?\n\nYou can preview your GBP post to see how it will look, but keep in mind that this preview is standardized. So it doesn’t show variations across devices and browsers. \n\nSemrush’s Social Poster provides a more consistent preview experience. The tool adjusts your post to meet the standard display criteria of different social platforms, including GBP. \n\nNote\n\nSocial Poster primarily ensures compliance with these platforms’ formatting rules rather than show device-specific or browser-specific variations.\n\nChecking your post manually on different devices and browsers is always recommended. This will ensure your content looks good everywhere. \n\nHow often should I share a post on my GBP?\n\nA good rule of thumb for maintaining an active and engaging Google Business Profile is to post regularly. \n\nWhile there's no one-size-fits-all approach, many businesses find that posting once a week keeps their profile fresh and relevant. \n\nIf you have more content to share, consider two to three GBP posts a week to keep your audience informed about your latest updates, offers, and events.\n\nRegular activity can help your profile stand out and increase engagement. \n\nTo make things easier for you, consider using efficient scheduling tools like Social Poster. This way, you’ll plan your posts, maintain a regular online presence, and free up time to focus on other areas of your business. \n\nStreamline Social Media Management\n\nwith a Semrush Social Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
