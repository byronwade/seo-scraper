  "content": "What Is a Lead Magnet?\n\nA lead magnet is a resource—like a guide or webinar—that people get in exchange for contact information, such as their name and email address.\n\nLead magnets are often called gated content because people need to enter information to access them.\n\nThe form people use to submit this information is typically referred to as an opt-in form. \n\nFor example, at Semrush, we offer a free webinar in exchange for information like someone’s name, business email, organization type, and more. And this is our opt-in form:\n\nWhen someone fills out the opt-in form, they’ll receive the lead magnet. Lead magnets are usually delivered via email or will open in the browser after submitting the form.\n\nThen, the information (like name and email address) is added to a database. This database contains the contact details of everyone who has requested the lead magnet. These people are referred to as \"leads.” \n\nBusinesses can then contact these leads and attempt to convert them into customers. \n\nPros of Using Lead Magnets\n\nLead magnets can be an effective lead generation strategy to grow your business. \n\nHere are the ways they can benefit you.\n\nEmail List Growth\n\nUsing email can convert more leads into customers. And optimize your sales funnel.\n\nAn email list (a collection of email addresses) lets you connect with people interested in your business. And market your products to them.\n\nWhen someone signs up to access your lead magnet, you can also add them to your email list (more on that when we go over how to create a lead magnet). \n\nImportant: Ensure your opt-in form mentions that, by entering an email, subscribers are signing up for your email list. You can do this by adding text to your opt-in form like this:\n\nImage Source: Simply Inspired Teaching\n\nOr by adding a checkbox where users agree to opt in to your email list.\n\nUse your email list to send out frequent emails. Like a weekly newsletter. \n\nAlberta Ballet sends emails to its list to promote upcoming shows and drive ticket sales.\n\nSending frequent emails can turn people from cold subscribers (people who don’t engage with your brand) to warm/hot subscribers (people likely to buy your products). \n\nEstablish Authority\n\nLead magnets are a great way to establish authority and grow credibility. \n\nBy offering valuable content for free, you can position yourself as an expert. And build trust with your audience. \n\nThis act of generosity can provide your audience with a glimpse of your expertise and help build your reputation as an authority in your niche.\n\nAudience Segmentation\n\nSegmenting—or grouping—your audience by specific attributes makes it easier to tailor your marketing message.\n\nMore importantly, segmented emails drive 30% more opens and 50% more click-throughs, according to HubSpot. Meaning more people will engage with your emails if the emails are segmented.\n\nLead magnets also simplify segmentation.\n\nFor example, say you run a consulting business. \n\nOn your opt-in form, you ask people to select their job title to help understand your audience and improve further marketing campaigns. They can choose between three roles: “CEO,” “VP,” and “other.”\n\nNow, let’s say you want to send an email to the people on your list. But you only want to email CEOs. \n\nThanks to your lead magnet’s opt-in form, you can identify CEOs on your list and send them hyper-targeted emails. \n\nCons of Using Lead Magnets\n\nWhile lead magnets have many pros, there are a few cons to consider before investing time and money into creating one. \n\nThis way, you’ll know whether a lead magnet is the right strategy for you.\n\nPrivacy Concerns\n\nPeople are growing more concerned with data privacy. Data subject requests (a user's request to access their personal information from an organization) grew by 72% from 2021 to 2022.\n\nThis means people might be hesitant to enter their information on opt-in forms.\n\nTo put your potential leads at ease, include links to your legal agreements (like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy) on your lead magnet’s opt-in form.\n\nPeople can read through your policies and decide if they’d like to submit their information.\n\nLow-Quality Leads\n\nLow-quality leads are people who sign up to access your free content without intending to further engage with your brand.\n\nUsually, these people aren’t in your target audience.\n\nFor example, a post-secondary student might download a case study to use for a class report. \n\nThe student isn’t likely to turn into a customer in the near future. So, they aren’t worthwhile to keep as a contact in your lead database.\n\nIn these cases, you might consider deleting contacts who haven’t opened any emails since joining your list. This likely means they aren’t interested in interacting with your business beyond the free resource.\n\nTime Intensive\n\nLead magnet development ranges from a couple of hours to several weeks, depending on what you create.\n\nFor example, a simple checklist might only take an hour to put together. But a white paper, complete with primary research, might take weeks.\n\nHowever, 17% of content marketers say that gated content is their best-performing content type. This means lead magnets can be worth the effort, assuming you target the right audience and provide a valuable asset. \n\nWith so many lead magnets to choose from, you’ll find it easy to pick a type that fits your constraints. \n\n5 Types of Lead Magnets\n\nHere are five types of lead magnets, along with real-life examples for each one.\n\n1. Interactive\n\nInteractive lead magnets are resources that engage and interact with your audience.\n\nTypes of interactive lead magnets include:\n\nLive webinars\nTemplates\nQuizzes\n\nYou may need some additional software to create an interactive lead magnet. \n\nFor example, Semrush’s Lead Generation Form app lets you create quizzes to use as lead magnets (we’ll show you how to do so in the next section).\n\nInteractive Lead Magnet Examples\n\nLegal firm The Procurement Office provides quarterly interactive webinars. \n\nInteractive webinars facilitate two-way discussions, where presenters can interact with participants directly. Like through a Q&A session at the end of the webinar. \n\nThese one-on-one interactions can be valuable for specific industries. Especially industries where one-on-one interaction is otherwise costly, like a legal firm. \n\nTemplates are another interactive lead magnet. \n\nUsers can download and customize a resource. For example, we packaged content planning templates for our audience in this content marketing starter kit:\n\nPersonality quizzes can be quick lead magnets to make. Wellness company Solluna put together a sleep quiz for its audience:\n\nCreate your own quiz using Semrush’s Lead Generation Forms app. \n\nAfter starting your free trial, open the app, and click the “Create New Form” button.\n\nAfter giving your form/quiz a name, click “Create Blank Form.” \n\nThis opens the drag-and-drop form builder where you can build your quiz:\n\nNext, drag and drop input areas to your form to collect information like names, email addresses, and more.\n\nThen, drag and drop elements from the “Questions” section to create your quiz. \n\nYou can add the following types of questions:\n\nText (short or long)\nMultiple choice (text or image)\nDrop-down\nMedia answer (like a video)\n\nLike this question:\n\nNext, use the “Hidden Field: Calculation” to apply a value to each answer.\n\nThis field is hidden from viewers. It lets you assign values to each answer to display specific results based on peoples’ answers.\n\nWhen your quiz is finished, click “Publish.” Toggle the “Form Status” to “ON.”\n\nThen, share your quiz through the provided link or embed code.\n\nCreate an Interactive Lead Magnet\n\nwith Lead Generation Forms\n\nGet a Free Trial →\n2. Written\n\nWritten content, like ebooks and guides, is ideal for those who prefer to write.\n\nTypes of written lead magnets include:\n\nEbooks\nReports\nWhite papers\nCase studies\nChecklists\nEmail courses\n\nOnce you’ve created a written lead magnet, save the document as a PDF for others to download. \n\nOr upload the document to your email marketing platform and turn it into an email course (a series of emails that teach recipients something).\n\nExamples of Written Lead Magnets\n\nSoftware company Hotjar offers a free ebook lead magnet that teaches people about customer delight:\n\nEbooks can be ideal for businesses with a blog. Why? Because you can often repurpose content like blog posts into a free ebook.\n\nA report is an ideal lead magnet if your business conducts research. Software company Algolia creates reports on topics related to their business. Like this report on tech integrations to boost sales:\n\nReports can be resource-intensive. But they can also be highly valuable if industry-related insights attract your target audience.\n\nLooking for something a little simpler and more cost-effective? Try a checklist. \n\nTravel site Love and London gives readers a free travel checklist to help ensure its target market doesn’t forget anything while traveling. \n\nConsider creating case studies if you can highlight customer stories and testimonials. \n\nTechnology company Aislelabs showcases how people use their software through customer case studies:\n\nCase studies tend to work well for companies that provide a service or software. This enables them to display how they solved a challenge for a customer.\n\nFor example, web developer One Page Love has a 100-day email course. Each day, subscribers receive a new tip.\n\nConsider an email course if you want to teach your audience something through text-based lessons.\n\n3. Videos\n\nVideo content is helpful when you want to teach your audience through audio and visuals.\n\nTypes of video lead magnets include:\n\nPre-recorded webinars\nTutorials\nCourses\n\nTo create video lead magnets, you’ll likely need video editing software and equipment like a microphone and camera. \n\nVideo Lead Magnet Examples\n\nAt Semrush, we offer a variety of pre-recorded webinars:\n\nPre-recorded webinars let you offer this content on a continual basis rather than at a specific time (like a live webinar).\n\nOr you can consider teaching something by creating a course. Like this one from CareerFoundry:\n\nCourses are usually multiple videos and each video represents one lesson.\n\nArtist Casey K. provides free pre-recorded video art tutorials. Each tutorial walks viewers through a step-by-step process to re-create a painting:\n\nTutorials can be valuable for product-based businesses that want to highlight different ways to use their products.\n\n4. Free Access\n\nGiving people free access to something is a popular lead magnet among SaaS (software as a service) providers. \n\nTypes of free access lead magnets include:\n\nFree trials\nProduct demos\nFree accounts\n\nWith free access, people can try your product before committing. This can increase their level of trust in your brand.\n\nExample of Free Access Lead Magnets\n\nWe offer people a free seven-day trial to our suite of SEO tools:\n\nThis way, people can get familiar with our product before upgrading to a paid plan.\n\nSoftware company HubSpot offers demos to potential customers.\n\nDemos can be effective if your offering is complex. This allows prospects to sit with a team member to see how your product works. And ask questions to get immediate answers.\n\nAnother idea is to give limited, free access to your product in exchange for an email. We do this with our keyword research tool, Keyword Magic. Users who subscribe to our free plan get 10 complimentary keyword searches per day. \n\n5. Monetary\n\nMonetary lead magnets can work for ecommerce sites that sell products. \n\nThese lead magnets usually include: \n\nFree shipping\nCoupons/discounts\nFree products\n\nBut lead magnets shouldn’t eat into your profits or be so insignificant that they’re not exciting to the consumer. \n\nFor example, a 5% coupon might not excite your audience. But a 75% coupon could cause you to lose money. Find the middle ground that works for your business without negatively impacting your revenue. \n\nMonetary Lead Magnet Examples\n\nSephora gives free shipping to those who create an account (and buy products while logged in):\n\nA free shipping lead magnet could be worthwhile if shipping costs are a barrier to your audience.\n\nYarn company Wool and the Gang offers two lead magnets—a 15% off coupon and free patterns:\n\nPairing multiple lead magnets together can encourage people to sign up. \n\nIn Wool and the Gang’s example, a 15% off coupon may not be appealing to people who aren’t ready to buy. But the free patterns might encourage a browser to sign up.\n\nRestaurant Red Lobster also offers multiple lead magnets. Like free food and a 10% off coupon.\n\nConsider pairing multiple lead magnets together to attract both shoppers and browsers. \n\nHow to Create a Lead Magnet\n\nLearn how to make a high-performing lead magnet that attracts your target audience. \n\n1. Research Your Audience\n\nKnowing your audience lets you craft an irresistible lead magnet.\n\nTools like One2Target help you gain a deep understanding of your audience so you know which type of lead magnet to create.\n\nTo start, click “One2Target” under “Trends” in the Semrush dashboard.\n\nSelect your location and enter up to five competitor domains. Click “Analyze.”\n\nThis displays a report that gives you information like audience demographics, socioeconomics, behavior, and more.\n\nClick through each tab to uncover useful information about your audience. For example, the “Behavior” tab tells you which social media platforms this audience visits.\n\nIn this example, most people use YouTube. This could mean this audience prefers video content. This means you may want to consider creating a video lead magnet.\n\nResearch Audiences for More Effective Lead Magnets\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\n2. Outline Your Lead Magnet\n\nNow that you know your audience (and what they like), start outlining your lead magnet.\n\nThis is where you’ll choose which type of lead magnet you’ll create (e.g., ebook, webinar, template, etc.). And the topic of your lead magnet.\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool can help you generate lead magnet ideas.\n\nFind “Keyword Magic Tool” in your Semrush dashboard under “Keyword Research” on the left-hand side.\n\nEnter your main lead magnet idea in the input box. Choose your location and click “Search.”\n\nThis displays thousands of related keywords to the keyword you entered. (We used “free cookbook” as an example.) \n\nThe report also shows each keyword’s average monthly search volume. Which helps you understand the popularity of your potential lead magnet.\n\nFilter keywords by certain words by clicking a word in the left column. For example, if we click “PDF,” the Keyword Magic Tool only shows keywords that contain “PDF,” like “free cookbooks PDF.”\n\nThese keywords can alert you to ideas you might not have considered before. Like a free diabetic cookbook PDF.\n\nGo through the keywords until you find an idea for a lead magnet that lines up with your audience research.\n\nFind Ideas for Lead Magnets\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Create Your Lead Magnet\n\nTime to create your lead magnet. This step depends on which type of lead magnet you pick.\n\nRegardless of which type you choose, these pointers will smooth out the creation process:\n\nReview your tech stack: See what tech you already have (and what you need) before making your lead magnet. If your tech stack is missing software (like design software), you might need to increase your budget. Or choose a different lead magnet.\nConsider your budget: If you’re strapped for time and money, consider creating lead magnets that are less resource-intensive. Like checklists. Or short PDF ebooks.\nKeep your branding consistent: Add elements like your company colors, typography, and logo to your lead magnet. This helps your audience think of you each time they open it.\nMake your lead magnet accessible: Ensure a wide range of people can enjoy your lead magnet. For example, add captions to videos and alt text (text that describes an image) to images in PDFs.\nHave someone review your lead magnet: Assign a team member to review your lead magnet before it’s live. Have them check for errors like grammar errors or video glitches.\nTest your lead magnet on various devices: Ensure your lead magnet looks great no matter which device someone accesses it on, like a mobile device or desktop computer.\n4. Create an Opt-In Form\n\nYour audience needs a way to opt in to your lead magnet. \n\nThe Lead Generation Forms app lets you create no-code forms. \n\nNote\n\nIf you haven’t used Lead Generation Forms yet, follow our walkthrough in the Interactive Lead Magnets Example section to get started, and then follow the rest of the steps here to create an opt-in form.\n\nIf you have previously used Lead Generation Forms, simply create a new, blank form.\n\nThen, drag and drop elements under the “Contact info” area like “Name” and “Email.” \n\nYou can also add “Short Text” inputs if you want to collect more information. Like someone’s place of work.\n\nNote\n\nIf you need help, our Lead Generation Forms setup guide walks you through each step in detail.\n\nWhen you’re done, publish your form. You will get a unique link and code to share your form and embed it anywhere on your site.\n\nTip\n\nIntegrate Lead Generation Forms with Google Sheets. From there, use a tool like Zapier to automatically import leads from the Google Sheet into your email marketing tool. \n\n5. Promote Your Lead Magnet\n\nEncourage people to sign up for your lead magnet by promoting it. \n\nEmbed your opt-in form on your site so visitors can sign up as they browse. Then, promote your lead magnet with pay-per-click ads (like Facebook ads or Google ads). \n\nFor example, here’s an ad for one of our lead magnets on Facebook:\n\nNext, share your lead magnet on social media. Use a scheduling tool like Social Poster to share your lead magnet on a consistent basis. \n\nOpen Social Poster by clicking “Social Poster” under “Social Media.”\n\nConnect the social platforms you want to post from and authorize Semrush.\n\nAfter connecting your social profiles, click “New post.” \n\nThen, create your post in the text area. Add photos to make it more visually interesting, and don’t forget a link to your lead magnet. Select the relevant profile(s). \n\nNext, decide if you want to post now, schedule, publish on a regular basis, or save as a draft. Select the date if you’re scheduling a post for later. \n\nClick “Schedule” or “Schedule & create another” to make another post. \n\n6. Optimize Your Lead Magnet\n\nTesting your lead magnet helps you identify areas of improvement so you can convert more people.\n\nThis involves gathering feedback to find out what leads liked about your magnet. And what they thought it lacked.\n\nThe quickest way to gather feedback is through a survey using Lead Generation Forms.\n\nNote\n\nIf you haven’t used Lead Generation Forms yet, follow our walkthrough in the Interactive Lead Magnets Example section to get started. And then follow the rest of the steps here to create a survey.\n\nAfter creating a new form, add questions by dragging and dropping the elements under “Questions” on the left-hand side of your screen.\n\nYou can add text questions (short and long).\n\nOr multiple-choice questions with text. \n\nYou can also choose “picture choice” to add photos to each option.\n\nHere are some questions you can use to inspire your survey:\n\nHow would you rate the perceived value of the information provided in the lead magnet?\nDid you find the information presented in a clear and organized manner?\nWhat aspects of the lead magnet exceeded your expectations?\nWhat aspects didn’t meet your expectations?\nWhat topics or information would you like to see in future lead magnets from us?\nHow would you rate the visual design and aesthetics of the lead magnet?\n\nAsking these questions can help you and your team uncover new insights about your audience. And optimize your lead magnet for the future.\n\nLead Magnet Best Practices\n\nHere are three additional best practices to consider as you put together a lead magnet.\n\nCreate an Email Sequence for New Leads\n\nEmail sequences can turn people from cold to warm leads. \n\nTypically, cold leads have low conversion rates. Meaning they aren’t likely to become customers right away.\n\nBut you can turn cold leads into hot leads (someone highly interested in your brand) by building rapport with them through an email sequence. \n\nAn email sequence is a series of emails your brand sends to your email list. \n\nExperiment to see which sending frequency yields the highest interaction in your emails (like clicks and opens).\n\nThese recurring emails should be filled with value for the recipient. \n\nConsider:\n\nTelling them about your brand\nOutlining how you can solve their problems\nSending them more free content\n\nAs people get each email, you increase the chance of turning them into a hot lead.\n\nThe more people that turn into hot leads, the more conversions and sales you are likely to get.\n\nChoose Relevant Segments\n\nSegments make it easy to find specific types of people within your leads.\n\nWhen creating opt-in forms, identify which additional information you need for useful segmentation.\n\nFor example, say you run a marketing agency. And you work with clients that generate a certain amount of revenue. \n\nConsider asking people for their company’s revenue on your opt-in form.\n\nYou can use this information to segment your audience. And find those who are more likely to fit your ideal client.\n\nTest Multiple Lead Magnets\n\nCreating two (or more) lead magnets gives you greater insight into what your audience likes. And which type of lead magnet will convert the best.\n\nFor example, write an ebook and create a video course that teach the same concepts.\n\nThen, see which format people prefer.\n\nOr create two ebooks on different topics and see which topic converts higher.\n\nKnowing what people like can help you develop high-converting lead magnets in the future. \n\nMetrics to Measure Your Lead Magnet’s Effectiveness \n\nTracking and measuring certain metrics tell you how your lead magnet is performing. \n\nYou can usually find these metrics within the dashboard of the software you use to create forms and deliver leads.\n\nHere are four to consider tracking. \n\nConversion Rate\n\nConversion rate is the percentage of people that sign up for your lead magnet. The average conversion rate for lead magnets varies from roughly 5.2% to 24.2%.\n\nImage Source: GetResponse\n\nFactors like your industry, type of lead magnet, and form can affect your lead magnet’s conversion rate. If your conversion rate is low, consider speaking to your audience to find out what’s stopping them from converting. \n\nThe Lead Generation Forms app shows you a summary of Views, Responses (the number of people who filled out and submitted the form), and Exits (people who viewed the form but didn’t submit their response).\n\nCalculate your conversion rate by dividing the number of responses by the number of views and multiplying it by 100.\n\nDollars Generated\n\nTying a dollar value to each lead helps you track whether your lead magnet is bringing you quality leads.\n\nCustomer relationship management software (software that manages your customers' interactions with your brand) can track leads and figure out how much money each lead magnet costs.\n\nReview the dollars generated from specific lead magnets. Consider removing any lead magnets that don’t generate a suitable ROI. \n\nLead Quality\n\nSome email marketing tools give subscribers a grade. This grading system lets you identify segments of high-quality leads. And segments of low-quality ones.\n\nFor example, email marketing software Mailchimp scores subscribers on a five-star scale.\n\nImage Source: Mailchimp\n\nReview the rating of your subscribers (if possible). If your lead magnet attracts many low-quality subscribers, it’s time to reconsider your promotional strategies. \n\nWhy? Because you could be attracting the wrong audience.\n\nSocial Shares\n\nTracking referrals from social media platforms can help you understand the reach of your lead magnet.\n\nA high share count might also indicate your audience finds your lead magnet valuable.\n\nSearch for the link of your lead magnet on different social media platforms to see how many people have shared it, or use a unique tracking code.\n\nFurther reading: UTM Codes in Google Analytics 4 (GA4): A Step-by-Step Tutorial\n\nCreate a High-Performing Lead Magnet\n\nLead magnets can help you scale your business and reach qualified leads.\n\nBut before you can get started, you’ll need effective lead magnet ideas and a way to create forms and collect emails.\n\nKeyword Magic Tool is a fast and easy way to generate hundreds of lead magnet ideas. And the Lead Generation Forms app will help you bring them to life through quizzes, surveys, opt-in forms, and more. \n\nTry these tools for free today.\n\nGet Everything You Need to Create Lead Magnets\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
