  "content": "If you’ve used Semrush before, you may have come across Authority Score. In this article, we’ll explain what Authority Score measures and how it can help you when making marketing decisions.\n\nWhat Is Semrush Authority Score?\n\nSemrush Authority Score is our compound metric used for measuring a domain’s or webpage’s overall quality and SEO performance. It’s based on a series of metrics that prove trustworthiness and authority. \n\nYou can find this score when researching a domain or webpage in Domain Overview, Backlink Analytics, Backlink Audit, or the Link Building Tool on Semrush.\n\nHow Is Authority Score Calculated?\n\nAuthority Score is the result of calculations that uses AI and machine learning to measure a domain’s authority based on three facets. \n\nThose three are: \n\nLink Power: quality and quantity of backlinks\nOrganic Traffic: estimated monthly average of organic search traffic \nSpam Factors: indicators of a spammy vs. natural link profile\n\nEach facet has a different weight on the score. Link Power holds the most weight. Organic traffic holds the next heaviest weight. \n\nThe Spam Factors metric is actually made up of six checks: \n\nNo organic rankings on SERPs \nUnnaturally high % of dofollow domains\nAn imbalance between links and organic traffic \nToo many referring domains with the same IP address\nToo many referring domains with the same IP network \nPresence of another domain with an identical backlink profile \n\nIf we detect one of these, it subtracts points from a domain’s final Authority Score. \n\nThe score is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, with the latter being the strongest. The final score is measured in relation to the most authoritative domains. \n\nBecause of that, there are only a few domains on the Internet with the highest scores—99s, 98s, etc.\n\nNote: Authority Score was updated in early 2023 in order to be more resistant to manipulation, which was tested in a study of 24,000 domains.\n\nGet a team account\n\nTo save on Semrush subscription\n\nLearn more →\nWhat Is a Good Authority Score?\n\nAuthority Score serves as an indicator of the overall quality of a domain or webpage. \n\nIn general, Authority Score is used for domain comparison and not for determining how good or bad domains are on an absolute scale. \n\nThis means you should judge a page or domain’s Authority Score in relation to similar websites in the same or neighboring niches.\n\nFor example, let’s say you’re trying to build links to a product page on your website that sells cast iron skillets. First, you’ll want to gather your prospects—sites that post content about food and cooking. \n\nWhen evaluating these prospects, you should avoid comparing the Authority Score of a small niche blog to the Authority Score of a huge website (such as, say, foodnetwork.com).\n\nIn turn, you might misjudge the value of a link from a blogger, like in the example below (this is a screenshot of the comparison feature in the Domain Overview report).\n\nThis blog, caseythecollegeceliac.blogspot.com, has a much lower Authority Score than foodnetwork.com.\n\nHowever, sometimes a link building prospect with a website that shows a lower Authority Score may be reasonable. Highly competitive niches and websites see higher average Authority Scores, while more low-key niches or websites will have lower average Authority Scores. \n\nIf we compare caseythecollegeceliac.blogspot.com to its close competitors, we can see that it actually has a higher Authority Score than the rest. \n\nIn this comparison, it may be a quality, narrowly-focused prospect for pitching a topic like “gluten free cast iron skillet recipes,” but it may not work well for a broader topic like “best cast iron recipes.\n\nHow to Use Authority Score for SEO\n\nAuthority Score provides useful data that may help you to improve your link building strategy when looking for quality domains, and to increase your website’s authority by tweaking your SEO efforts. Some ways to use Authority Score in your SEO workflow may include:\n\nCompetitor analysis\nJudging link building prospects\nTracking the impact of an SEO campaign over time\nWatching out for negative SEO\n\nIn these cases, Authority Score Trend may be handy. It could help you compare how much work a site needs to catch up to its competition or how much potential benefit a new investment or partnership with a website may bring.\n\nWebsite Authority Score Trend in Backlink Analytics Overview \n\nIf a domain’s score shows an upward trend, it may be a sign that the site is actively working to improve its online presence and reputation. It may also be a sign of inefficient SEO on the competition’s side.\n\nIf a domain’s score is trending downward, it could mean that the niche the website operates in is very competitive. A domain with this trend is falling behind its competition. It could be for many reasons. Examples include site’s recent SEO efforts are ineffective, the site may have suffered from a negative SEO attack, etc.\n\nThe list above isn’t exhaustive. The possible reasons why a domain's Authority Score decreased or increased could be detected only after carrying out a comprehensive analysis of its SEO performance and the actions of its competitors.\n\nUsing the Semrush Link Building Tool for Link Building\n\nIn Semrush’s Link Building Tool, we have a column called “Rating.” It takes Authority Score into account along with a series of other factors to help you decide if it’s a good link prospect.\n\nHere’s a general idea of how we decide the rating out of 5 points: \n\nA high score: a backlink from this site would pass on a lot of link authority (good Authority Score, high relevance) and we see the site as a realistic prospect to acquire a link from.\nA low score: a backlink from this site wouldn’t provide a lot of value for your backlink profile (low Authority Score, low relevance) and we see the site as less realistic or harder to acquire a link from. \n\nSome other aspects that help us determine a prospect’s rating include:\n\nThe domain’s overall quality based on links, keywords, and traffic\nThe domain’s relevance based on having a common niche\nThe domain’s health based on spam factors\n\nA higher rating means there may be a more realistic possibility to attain backlinks and that it’s a high-quality website. \n\nThe table below is from the Link Building Tool. It ranks a domain’s link building prospects by Authority Score and Rating.\n\nThese sites have really high Authority Scores in the 90s, but we rate them a 1 out of 5. \n\nWhy’s that? \n\nGetting a link from these websites for our project domain (seoquake.com) might be unrealistic, which is why they get a low rating. \n\nIf we filter by Rating instead of Authority Score, we’ll find prospects we rate the best to have scores ranging between 50 and 70.\n\nOut of the domains in this screenshot, hostinger.com has the highest Authority Score, making it a good backlink candidate from that site to yours.\n\nHow to Increase a Domain’s Authority Score\n\nYou can boost your site’s Authority Score in a few ways:\n\nGetting more organic traffic to your site\nBuilding more high quality links\nReducing spam factors in your link profile \n\nWant more organic traffic? Creating quality content is one way to do that. \n\nStart by researching content in your niche. Visit forums and social media to see what people in your niche are talking about.\n\nYou can plug these ideas into Topic Research and sort by Topic Efficiency to get more content ideas that have a high search volume and are easier to rank for.\n\nThen, find keywords that can help boost these topics in the search engine. Use a keyword research tool, like Keyword Magic Tool to find relevant queries. \n\nUse helpful, quality content to earn backlinks from trustworthy domains that are relevant to your site.\n\nMore link building strategies that may increase your site’s Authority Score include:\n\nCreating quality content on your website, sharing it, and conducting outreach asking websites (that don’t already link to you) for a link to your new page.\nFinding directories and indexes that list websites/businesses in your niche and get added to the directory.\nFinding best-of articles or lists in your niche that you think your website could be included in, and ask to be included.\nFinding broken links that used to point to your competitor’s site, and reach out to the site with the broken links to ask for a link to yours instead.\nInvestigating any toxic backlinks in your link profile.\n\nThe following will not directly increase a domain’s Authority Score:\n\nAdding more pages to your website\nAcquiring more “nofollow” backlinks\nAcquiring more UGC or sponsored backlinks\nReceiving more links from a domain that already links to your site\n\nShould you only concentrate on link building and content creation? No.\n\nAll your efforts should be in-line with a multipurpose SEO strategy. Gaining keywords that bring traffic to your website is just one of the actions among many you may consider to improve your Authority Score. It is not a magic bullet that will make your score rocket up.\n\nRemember that Authority Score is a compound metric based on different factors and indicators—you should not rely on one of them individually. Take a holistic approach instead.\n\nGaining a higher Authority Score is about the cumulative effect of all your SEO efforts.\n\nSemrush Authority Score FAQ\nWhat is a good website Authority score?\n\nIt depends. In general, you cannot call one Authority Score good and another bad. \n\nWhile a score of 0 means that a domain is not the strongest, Authority Score is used more for domain comparison, and not for determining good/bad on an absolute scale. \n\nWhat you can do is discover your competitors and then benchmark where their Authority Scores are. Then aim for a score that is equal to or above theirs.\n\nAs for looking at the trend, we recommend checking whether the domain’s Authority Score trend is falling or rising. Again, you can visualize this in the Backlink Analytics.\n\nWhy did my score go down?\n\nIf a domain’s authority score is going down it could be for many reasons.\n\nSome common reasons are:\n\nYour website was outperformed by niche competitors\nYour recent SEO efforts may be less effective\nYou may have suffered a negative SEO attack\nYour backlink profile could be stronger\n\nScore. Each site’s case is strictly individual. Run an in-depth analysis of your website’s SEO performance and that of your competitors’ to find out the possible reasons why your Authority Score went down. \n\nIs a low score indicative of a spammy domain?\n\nIn short, no. But, when you see a low score, it may mean the site has fewer trust signals than a reputable site may have. \n\nWe recommend investigating the sites with low scores to find out if they, in fact, appear spammy, or if they are perhaps just brand-new websites that are not established yet.\n\nCan Google Penalties affect the score?\n\nDirectly, it is very unlikely. Receiving a Google Penalty won’t impact your site’s Authority Score immediately.\n\nHowever, after receiving a penalty, we recommend disavowing backlinks that are directly causing the penalty in order to lift it and prevent possible negative consequences to your Authority Score in the future.\n\nShould I report my client’s increase in Authority Score to them in a regular report?\n\nYes, if you explain to them what it is. Just don’t rely solely on Authority Score for a domain’s overall performance—use it in conjunction with other key metrics like conversions, organic keyword positions, traffic, etc.\n\nShow your client how their site’s Authority Score compares to other sites in their same niche (remember, it is a comparative metric, not an absolute metric).\n\nDo more backlinks from the same referring domain boost Authority Score? \n\nNo, once you have a backlink from a website, getting more backlinks from the same website will not increase your Authority Score.\n\nFor more link building tips, check out our dedicated guide, Link Building for SEO.\n\nGet a team account\n\nTo save on Semrush subscription\n\nLearn more →",
