  "content": "Businesses use artificial intelligence (AI) for content marketing to speed up the content production process.\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nThey also use AI to get content ideas, generate working drafts, assist with creative and SEO strategies, and write better for their target audience.\n\nAnd you can, too.\n\nReady to learn how to use AI for content marketing? Let’s dive in.\n\nPro tip\n\nTry out AI content marketing production with ContentShake AI. The tool can generate ideas and optimized drafts, taking into consideration your target audience, desired tone, and SEO data.\n\nThe Benefits of Using AI for Content Marketing\n\nAI is making it easier and faster to create engaging content. But it’s not just about efficiency.\n\nAI can also shape your creative strategy and help you come up with fresh ideas.\n\nHere are more specific benefits of using AI as a part of your content marketing processes:\n\nAI accelerates content development by streamlining the writing process. It suggests topics, generates outlines, and even drafts content.\nAI improves scalability by increasing your content output without needing more writing resources \nAI reduces costs throughautomating some content creation tasks. Which makes the content creation process more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nBut even though AI can be a huge help, it's not perfect.\n\nThe Challenges of AI Content Marketing\n\nAI is a great tool to support your content production efforts. But it also has some drawbacks:\n\nLack of accuracy: Sometimes, AI doesn't get the facts right. It can misinterpret data, provide outdated information, or even “hallucinate” (invent false information). This means you always need to double-check AI-generated content before publishing.\nRisk of plagiarism: AI tools might generate content that's too similar to existing material on the web. Which leads to plagiarism concerns.\nLack of human touch: AI-generated content can sometimes feel impersonal, inauthentic, and even robotic\nWrong tone of voice: AI tools struggle to hit the right tone of voice. The copy sometimes sounds too formal, too casual, or like something is just “off.”\n\nRead on to learn how to navigate these challenges. And effectively integrate AI into your content marketing strategy.\n\n6 Ways to Use AI for Content Marketing\n1. Generating Content Ideas\n\nAI can suggest topics that are likely to resonate with your audience. \n\nThis provides a steady stream of inspiration to keep your content fresh and engaging. And can help you create relevant blog articles and social media posts.\n\nHere’s how you can use AI to generate content ideas with ContentShake AI. \n\nLet’s say you’re the content manager of a pet care brand. And you want to find content ideas about dog food.\n\nThe tool will ask questions about your business. Enter your responses and click “Continue.”\n\nYou’ll reach the home screen. With a bunch of ideas based on your industry, grouped by topic.\n\nClick on the topic bubbles found at the top of the page, like “best puppy food,” to get more ideas. Or click “My own idea” to add your own idea and get more suggestions.\n\nFor each topic, the tool tells you the following:\n\nSearch intent: What searchers want to see when they use a keyword\nEfficiency score: How rewarding using a certain topic will be based on search volume and keyword difficulty\nTraffic information: How many visitors you’re likely to get from writing about that topic\n\nFor example, “best puppy food” has commercial intent. Meaning most articles ranking for this keyword are probably a list of product comparisons.\n\nIt has a high efficiency. Meaning the target keyword probably gets a good number of searches per month. And isn’t too difficult to rank for.\n\nThe tool also says, “This idea will attract a lot of traffic.” Meaning you’re likely to get lots of website visitors if you rank well for this topic.\n\nGenerated ideas under the “dog food” topic include:\n\n“The Importance of Quality Dog Food”\n“How to Choose Healthy Dog Food”\n“Homemade Dog Food Recipes to Try”\n\nThese ideas and insights can help you create content that meets user needs and attracts traffic to your site. \n\n2. Writing Drafts\n\nOnce you’ve decided what you want to write about, you can use AI to create drafts for you.\n\nThis speeds up the content creation process. Because it’s often easier to edit a draft than write an article from scratch.\n\nBut take note:\n\nAlways edit AI-generated drafts for accuracy. AI doesn’t always produce the most accurate outputs. So double-check that there are no inaccurate claims within the generated draft.\n\nYou can draft content with the ContentShake AI tool. \n\nUse one of Semrush’s ideas. Or add your own.\n\nThen click the “Start writing” button.\n\nThe “Create an article” window will pop up. Enter a title or choose one of the suggestions. \n\nYou can toggle between “Suggested by AI” and “Used by Competitors” to choose an engaging title. \n\nEnter your target keyword, word count, tone of voice, and readability level. When you’re done, hit “Create article.”\n\nAI will create a draft for you, complete with images. Like this one about “How to Choose Healthy Dog Food”:\n\nLook through the article to see if you’re mostly happy with the output. If not, click “Go to regenerate” to generate a new draft with different parameters.\n\nOr click “Go to editor” to modify it yourself. \n\nAI can help you get started quickly. It gives you ideas and a promising first draft to adapt and expand on.\n\nBut creating high-quality content still requires a human touch. So the first draft will still need some input from you to be effective. \n\n3. Optimizing Content for Search Engines\n\nYou can use AI to check if your content is optimized for SEO. \n\nSemrush’s SEO Writing Assistant can help you understand if your draft is optimized and ready for publishing. And provide suggestions on how to improve your article.\n\nTo get started, copy and paste your content into the field provided. Then, enter your keywords and the location of your target audience. And hit “Get recommendations.”\n\nThe tool analyzes your text. And shows you an overall score out of 10 for your article. This is based on readability, originality, SEO, and tone of voice:\n\nScroll down to see more feedback on readability and SEO. For example, it might tell you that you are overusing certain keywords. And make recommendations for keywords you could use more of.\n\nIt also provides feedback on the tone of voice. It flags any sentences that are too casual or too formal. And prompts you to remove unnecessary filler words. \n\nThis feedback can help you improve and optimize your article before you publish it. So you get the best results from your content.\n\n4. Editing Content for Your Audience\n\nYou can use an AI tool like ChatGPT to better understand your audience’s needs and interests. AI can also review content drafts and tell you if they’re relevant for a particular audience.\n\nHere’s how to do both those things:\n\nLet’s say you’re writing content for first-time puppy owners. \n\nFirst, sign up for a free ChatGPT account (or a similar tool), if you don’t already have one.\n\nThen, ask ChatGPT about your target audience’s needs, interests, and challenges. Like this:\n\n“I’m creating content for first-time puppy owners. What are their needs, interests, and challenges?”\n\nUse these insights to inform your content strategy. So you can plan content that aligns with your audience’s specific interests and challenges.\n\nIn this case, some content ideas for your target audience could be, “how to train a puppy” or “what kind of food is best for puppies.”\n\nAfter you write your content, you can share your drafts with the AI tool. And ask if your content meets your audience’s needs. Or who the content would be suitable for. \n\nTo do this, paste the content into the tool and ask for feedback.\n\nFor example, let’s ask ChatGPT if this draft on “How to Choose Healthy Dog Food” is suitable for our audience of first-time puppy owners:\n\nThe tool scans the article and provides ideas on how to make the content more relevant for your audience. Like incorporating more puppy-specific advice and practical examples for different puppy breeds or sizes. \n\nIf you want to target different groups of people, you can ask the AI tool which audience the content is most suitable for. \n\nLet’s say you're trying to reach first time puppy owners, experienced dog owners, and pro trainers. You can ask the AI tool which audience is most likely to be interested in the content.\n\nThe AI tool tells you who the content is best suited for. And provides suggestions on how to make the content even more relevant. You can use this information to tweak your content. Which is likely to drive better results. \n\n5. Repurposing Content\n\nContent repurposing involves taking existing content and transforming it into different formats. Or modifying it for different platforms.\n\nFor example, you might create a YouTube video and then turn it into a blog post, an email newsletter, and a LinkedIn post.\n\nThis approach allows your content to reach more people across different platforms.\n\nUse Semrush’s AI Social Content Generator to turn existing content into posts, hashtags, and videos you can use on social media.\n\nTo get started, open the tool and paste your content, or part of your content, in the space provided. And hit “Generate.”\n\nBased on the text you entered, the tool will generate the following:\n\nA social media video\nA social media image\nText for a social media post\nRelevant hashtags\n\nLook through the generated content. Then, choose the one you like and edit it. By clicking on the pen button at the top right corner of the post.\n\nWe recommend adding your logo, where applicable. And editing the caption for tone of voice, if needed.\n\nUsing AI makes it easy to turn your existing content into bite-sized, engaging chunks that are ideal for social media. \n\n6. Creating Visuals\n\nVisuals, such as stock photos, original photographs, and infographics, are important because they:\n\nGrab attention\nSimplify complex ideas\nAre memorable\nEncourage sharing\nImprove SEO (because they can show up in Google Images results, too)\n\nPro tip\n\nOptimizing your images can help you get more traffic from search engines. Read our guide to image SEO best practices to ensure you get the most value out of your visuals. \n\nIf you generate a draft with ContentShake AI, the tool automatically includes free stock images in the article. And links to the original source. Like this:\n\nYou can also use AI image generation tools to create your own visuals from scratch. Like with Canva’s Free Online AI Image Generator.\n\nTo start creating your own visuals, click “Generate AI Images.”\n\nDecide whether you want to use a new or existing design. And your format.\n\nThen, describe what image you want to create. Like “cute puppy eating dog food.” And choose a style, like “Photo” (which is more realistic), “Dreamy,” or “Anime.” And set the aspect ratio, like “Square” or “Landscape.” \n\nWhen you’re done, click “Generate image.”\n\nCanva will generate a few images for you to choose from. Click on each image to enlarge it. Or hit the “Generate again” button to get different results. \n\nOnce you’ve chosen an image, click the “Share” button to download it. \n\nImages are a great way to make your content more engaging and break up blocks of text. And AI tools can help you generate simple images quickly. \n\n3 Best Practices for Using AI for Content Marketing\n\nUsing AI in content marketing can streamline your workflow and spark creativity. But it's important to use it wisely.\n\nHere are some best practices to ensure you get the most out of AI tools. While maintaining quality:\n\n1. Double-Check Everything\n\nAI tools for content marketing can create text and images quickly. But it's crucial to have a human review everything.\n\nHere are some common issues you’ll want to watch out for:\n\nFactual accuracy: Verify all facts, figures, and data provided by AI against credible sources. Even small inaccuracies can undermine your credibility.\nTone consistency: Ensure that the tone of the AI-generated content aligns with your brand’s voice. AI can sometimes generate content that feels out of sync with your usual style. Like super formal or too funny and enthusiastic. \nGrammar and syntax: Check for any grammatical errors or awkward sentence structures that AI might have overlooked. Correcting these will improve readability and professionalism.\nContextual relevance: Make sure the content is contextually appropriate for your audience and the topic. AI might not fully grasp subtleties specific to certain contexts or cultural nuances.\nUnintended duplication: Look out for any sections that might be too similar to existing content (either your own or someone else’s). Anything you publish needs to be original to avoid plagiarism concerns and duplicate content. \nSEO optimization: Review keyword usage to ensure it aligns with SEO best practices and sounds natural. For example, AI might overuse keywords or put them in awkward places.\nCall to action: Think about the purpose of your content and what you would like the reader to do once they finish reading the piece. AI doesn’t know your marketing strategy as well as you do, so you might need to add or adjust the call to action.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s Plagiarism Checker and AI Detector to check if a piece has instances of plagiarism.\n \n\nJust copy and paste your text and hit the check button.\n \n\nYou’ll get a plagiarism report with the percentage of plagiarized content, percentage of probable AI content, readability, reading time, and grammar issues.\n \n\n2. Don’t Rely Solely on AI\n\nThink of AI as a helpful assistant rather than the entire solution. \n\nYes, AI can help you come up with cool, new ideas. And pump out first drafts faster than a human could. \n\nBut to get best results, your content still needs that human touch.\n\n3. Stay Compliant\n\nUsing AI responsibly involves understanding the legal and ethical implications, especially concerning data privacy and copyright laws. Here are some of the key concerns:\n\nData privacy: AI systems use large datasets to learn and generate content. If you’re using a third-party tool, be careful not to share any confidential information. Because you don’t know how this data will be used. Some employers have banned certain AI tools for this reason.\nCopyright laws: AI analyzes existing content to generate new content. This can raise copyright issues, especially if the AI-generated version closely resembles the original. Or if the tool used copyrighted materials without permission. Make sure any content you post on your site is original. \nBias and fairness: AI systems can be biased. For example, The Washington Post found that AI image generators often perpetuate gender and racial stereotypes. Review any content before you share it to ensure it reflects your brand’s values and standards. \n\nIf you decide to integrate AI into your content marketing strategy, you need to do it in a responsible way. So you remain in line with legal standards and your audience’s expectations. \n\nBoost Your Content Marketing with AI\n\nWhether you need a hand with the writing process or just want fresh ideas, AI content marketing tools can help you kickstart your content marketing efforts. \n\nWith ContentShake AI, you can generate exciting, new ideas and generate first drafts in record time. So you can create better content faster than ever before. \n\nTry it today for free and discover the benefits of AI-powered content marketing.\n\nAutomate Content Production\n\nwith ContentShake AI App\n\nSign up Free →",
