  "content": "Knowing who links to your website is an essential step in building authority. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause search engines like Google use backlinks, a link to your website from another, in their ranking algorithms. When high-quality sites link to yours, it signals that your site is also high-quality.\n\nThe more quality backlinks you have, the more likely Google is to rank your webpages highly. Plus, links from multiple domains indicate your site is trusted by many others in your industry.\n\nHere’s how to find out who links to your site and how to improve your backlink profile. \n\nHow to Find Who Links to Your Site\n\nYou can use the following tools to discover who is linking to your site: \n\nGoogle Search Console\n\nGoogle Search Console is a free platform that gives you access to key SEO data about your website—including who is linking to your site.\n\nIf you don’t have an account yet, you’ll need to set one up. Once you verify your website property, Search Console will start tracking backlinks. \n\nTo see your backlinks, navigate to Search Console > “Links” > “External links” > “Top linked pages”\n\nThere, you’ll find key information about your website’s backlink profile. Like the following:\n\nNote\n\nGoogle uses the term “external links” when referring to links from other websites that point to your domain. In other words, your backlinks.\n\nLook at the section labeled “Top linking sites.” Then, click “More.”\n\nThe number at the top of the page is your website’s total number of backlinks (that Google has detected). Beneath that is a list of websites linking to your domain property.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with a website in the list, you may want to review its quality. \n\nClick the arrow next to the domain. It will open the linking URL in your web browser. \n\nOr, if you want more details about the linking site, click anywhere on the domain name.\n\n There you’ll see:\n\nTotal links from the root domain\nHow many pages on your website are linked to from the domain\nPage URLs on your website linked from the domain\n\nFor example, the below website has 11 backlinks from the website site#1.com. Those links all point to the same page.\n\nYou can repeat this process for however many linking sites are on your list.\n\nAnd you can use Google Search Console to see whenever a new website links to yours.\n\nSemrush Backlink Audit\n\nAnother way to find and analyze backlinks is to use Semrush’s Backlink Audit.\n\nFirst, navigate to “Link Building” > “Backlink Audit.”\n\nClick “Create project.” \n\nEnter your homepage URL, name the project (if desired), and click “Create project.”\n\nYou’ll need to specify some settings for your audit. Start by selecting which version of your domain you want to audit.\n\nPro tip\n\nYou can learn more about the tool’s settings in our Backlink Audit Configuration Guide. \n\n Then, click “Brand settings.”\n\nSpecify any brand names associated with your website. Then, click “Domain categories.”\n\nChoose your website’s primary topic categories. Then, click “Target countries.”\n\nNote\n\nLinks from websites that are topically relevant to yours are generally more valuable. So, this step helps the tool better identify low-quality links.\n\nNext, select the target countries where you want your website to appear in search results. Then, click “Start Backlink Audit.” \n\nOnce your audit is complete, you’ll be notified via email. Click “Go to Backlink Audit” to open your report.\n\nIf you stay in the dashboard, wait for your audit to complete. Then, click “View.”\n\nNote\n\nConnect your Google Search Console account to help ensure all backlinks to your website are included in the audit.\n\nThere are two ways to see who is linking to your site. The first is in the “Analyzed Backlinks” section of your report. That number is the total number of backlinks identified in the audit.\n\nFor example, the website below has 33,700 backlinks.\n\nClick on the blue number to open a complete list of your backlinks. Then, select the “Domain” tab. Each backlink will be labeled with the title tag of the page where it appears. \n\nLook at the bolded text next to the word “Source.” That is the website where the link is located.\n\nYou can also use “Referring Domains” on your dashboard to see who links to your website. The blue number is the total number of websites linking to yours. \n\nFor example, the website below has 6,100 websites linking to it.\n\nClick on the blue number to open a complete list of your Referring Domains. \n\nLike before, the website where the link is located will appear in bold.\n\nUnlike Google Search Console, Semrush provides additional information about your linking sites. \n\nHere’s what you can learn using Backlink Audit: \n\nThe linking website’s Authority Score, a Semrush metric that estimates the authority of a website\nThe linking website’s Toxicity Score, a Semrush metric that estimates the potential harmfulness of a website to your SEO based on spam factors\nThe source page: the URL of the page where the link is located\nThe type of backlink (e.g., text, image, etc.)\nThe anchor text: the clickable text that forms the hyperlink\nPossible actions based on the link’s quality (e.g., “Move to Whitelist,” “Move to Remove,” etc.)\n\nYou can use the above information to evaluate the quality of your linking sites. \n\nAnd to know whether they’re helping or harming your SEO.\n\nFind Out Who Links to Your Site\n\nwith the Backlink Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Find Who Links to a Specific Page\n\nWant to see who links to a specific page on your website? Use Backlink Analytics.\n\nEnter the full page URL into the search bar. Then, click “Analyze.”\n\nThe report will only show data for the specific page rather than backlink data for your entire website.\n\nLook at the blue number below “Referring Domains.” That is the number of websites linking to the page. \n\nFor example, 210 websites (referring domains) are linking to this URL. \n\nClick on the blue number to see what those websites are.\n\nYou can organize the display by the highest-quality or lowest-quality websites by clicking on the “AS” (Authority Score) filter in the first column of the table:\n\nTo see more details about your backlinks, look at the Backlinks column. The number displayed is the total number of backlinks from the domain. \n\nClick on the arrow to the left of the number to expand the row.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse the “Competitors” tab to discover similar websites to your linking sites. Click “...” above the table to access the tab. Consider reaching out to the domains listed to see if they would be interested in linking to your content to help build an even stronger backlink profile. \n\nHow to Find Who Links to Your Competitors (or Any Site)\n\nYou can also use Backlink Analytics to see who links to your competitors’ websites.\n\nEnter your competitor’s URL. Then, click “Analyze.”\n\nClick the blue number under “Referring Domains.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of the websites linking to your competitors. \n\nThe number in the “Backlinks” column is the number of links your competitor has from the linking website. Click the arrow to the left of the number to expand the row.\n\nYou’ll see the following:\n\nPage URL: full page URL of the linking page \nAnchor text: the text that forms the clickable hyperlink\nLink type: text, image, etc.\nDates: including when the link was first and last seen\n\nIf the link is no longer live, it will be marked as “Lost.” The date in the “Last Seen” column will be displayed in red.\n\nThis information can benefit you in a few ways:\n\nGive you ideas for websites you may want to reach out to for link building\nSee what types of content or topics earn more backlinks\nSee whether the link is live or has been removed\nSee what anchor text people use to link to your competitors (Search engines can use anchor text to understand the content of the linked-to page.)\n\nYou can also do a direct comparison of your backlink profile to your competitors using Backlink Gap.\n\nEnter your homepage URL into the first text bar next to “You.” \n\nThen, add your competitor’s homepage URL into the second text bar. \n\nOr select one of the competitors Semrush suggests. Hover your cursor over the text box to see a list of possible competitors.\n\nPro tip\n\nChoose realistic competitors. For example, the above website, sitstay.com, has an Authority Score of 34 and is unlikely to compete with Petco (AS 77) or PetSmart (AS 76). Choosing competitors with an Authority Score equal to or slightly above your own can help lead to more high-quality insights for link building.\n\nEnter at least one competitor, then click “Find prospects.”\n\nYou can compare your backlink profile with up to four competing websites. \n\nThe “Backlink Gap” report will show you a comparison chart. Look at the first column titled “Referring Domain.” These are the websites linking to your competitors but not your website. \n\nFor example, cambridge.org is linking to all four competitors included in this “Backlink Gap” report. \n\nCambridge.org could be worth targeting through link building or digital PR outreach. Because they are interested in similar topic areas. And are willing to include links to relevant content.\n\nTo view how many links a competitor has from a referring domain, look at the number underneath the column with their name. \n\nTo see more details about those links, click the arrow to the left of the number.\n\nThe row will expand to show:\n\nThe source page Authority Score\nThe source page title and URL\nExternal links on the source page\nInternal links on the source page\nAnchor text of the link\nTarget URL of the link (your competitor’s page)\n\nThere are a few ways you can leverage the information found in Backlink Gap.\n\nFirst, if you have a similar piece of content to your competitor’s, then the source website may also be interested in linking to your content.\n\nTo reach out to a specific website, check the box to the left of the referring domain. Check as many boxes as you want. Then, click “+ Start outreach.”\n\nSelect the project you’re working on, then click “Send prospects.”\n\nThis will send those prospects to the Link Building Tool. You can use it to find the email addresses of your link prospects and to reach out. (See more about the tool below.)\n\nIf you don’t have a similar piece of content on your website, you may want to consider creating one. As long as it is relevant to your website’s topic areas. And brings value to your target audience.\n\nYou can use the SEO Content Template to get ideas for similar content. Once that content is live on your website, you can reach out to the websites listed in the “Backlink Gap” report.\n\nGet Insights on Backlink Profiles\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Improve Your Website’s Backlink Profile\n\nImproving your backlink profile involves getting more backlinks from high-quality websites.\n\nHere’s how to do it.\n\n1. Create Link-Worthy Content\n\nHaving lots of high-quality content on your website gives other websites more reasons to link to you.\n\nThis type of content is often called “link bait.” Because the content is so valuable, it’s easy to get other webmasters to link to it.\n\nSome common qualities of good link bait include:\n\nRelevant to your target audience\nMeets search intent (i.e., the true intent of the user’s search, whether buying a product, getting more information, etc.)\nIncludes data, statistics, interviews, or surveys\nMeets an immediate need (e.g., helpful tools)\nProvides actionable insights\nIncludes high-quality visuals\n\nFor example, take this helpful mortgage rate calculator from bankrate.com. \n\nIt has over 303,000 backlinks.\n\nOr our list of content marketing statistics: \n\nWhich has over 9,400 backlinks.\n\nThere are many ways to create link bait on your website.\n\nFor example, keyword and competitor research will help you see what type of content performs well in your industry. This can provide you with inspiration for new content ideas. \n\nDepending on what you want to create, you may need various resources like graphic design, web development, public relations, and more. \n\nBut high-quality, evergreen content can be worth the effort because it can help you build links throughout each year. \n\n2. Reach Out to Webmasters Using the Link Building Tool\n\nTo get your content in front of more people, it can be helpful to reach out to sites directly. The Link Building Tool can connect you with websites that may be interested in linking to your content.\n\nGo to “Link Building” > “Link Building Tool.”\n\nEnter your homepage URL. Then click “Start Link Building.”\n\nNext, add keywords you want your domain to rank for. The tool will populate with suggestions, but you can add your own by entering one keyword per line and clicking “Add.” \n\nAdding keywords is important, as it helps the tool identify good link prospects that are topically relevant to your website.\n\nWhen you have all of your keywords included, click “Keywords.”\n\nNext, add the homepage URL of up to 10 competitors.\n\nThe tool will populate with suggestions, but you can add your own using the same process outlined above. Adding competitors will help the tool suggest similar websites for your outreach.\n\nWhen you’re done, click “Start Link Building.”\n\nWhen your report is ready, click “View prospects.”\n\nYou’ll get a list of websites that may be good prospects for link building.\n\nPay attention to prospects with a high Authority Score and a high Rating. They are likely high-quality prospects for your outreach. \n\nYou can click the arrow to the left of the Rating score to expand the row and see more quality indicators.\n\nPay attention to:\n\nBacklinks: Prospects with more backlinks are often more authoritative\nKeywords and Traffic: Prospects with good SEO metrics are likely more high-quality\nCommon categories: Prospects with topical relevance to yours are often more valuable\nCompetitors backlinks: Prospects that have linked to your competitors may be more willing to link to your content\n\nIf you want to reach out, click “To In Progress” to add the prospect to an outreach list.\n\nOnce you’re done adding prospects, click the “In Progress” tab. Now, you can use your list to reach out to webmasters.\n\nTo email a link prospect, click “Contact” or “# emails” located in the “Email” column. The “To” field will auto-populate with the email addresses the tool found. If you want to add or remove any, do so before sending.\n\nYou can start drafting your pitch from there.\n\nYou can also research the best person to reach out to for a linking opportunity. You can often find contact information on the “About Us” pages of your target websites. Or on social media profile pages like LinkedIn.\n\nRemember that a good link-building outreach email will usually:\n\nIntroduce yourself and your website\nReference why a partnership interests you (e.g., the website’s topic areas, reputation, or quality)\nInclude a link to a high-quality content asset that could bring value to their target audience\nThank them for their time and consideration \n\nYou can repeat this process for all of the prospects you have marked “In Progress.” \n\nRemember: The more solid pitches you send, the more chances you have of earning links.\n\nFurther reading: Link-Building Strategies: 8 Ways to Build Links\n\n3. Monitor Your Website’s Toxicity Score\n\nThe “Toxicity Score” in your Backlink Audit shows the percentage of your backlinks that come from non-toxic, potentially toxic, or toxic websites. \n\nYou should aim for a low Toxicity Score. A high score can signal that too many of your backlinks are located on low-quality websites. Like the website below.\n\n“Toxic” websites may include non-indexed websites, spammy websites, or those with malware or viruses.\n\nIf you’re not sure why a website that links to yours is labeled toxic, return to your list of Referring Domains in the Backlink Audit report.\n\nThen, click the number located in the “TS” column.\n\nYou’ll see a list of the toxicity markers identified on the linking website. \n\nThese markers are included because they have been specifically mentioned by Google as signs of low-quality, untrustworthy websites.\n\nThis means these backlinks could be harming your SEO. \n\nHere are a few ways you can lower your Toxicity Score:\n\nAcquire more backlinks from high-quality websites\nSubmit a request to the webmaster to remove any toxic links\nDetermine whether you need to disavow toxic links. (Note: This should be done as a last resort, and only by someone with experience using Google’s disavow tool.)\nStart Tracking Your Backlinks Today\n\nEarning backlinks from high-quality websites can be enormously beneficial to the organic ranking potential of your webpages. \n\nAnd knowing who links to your site can also help you maintain a healthy backlink profile. And discover new linking opportunities.\n\nTo recap, you can use the following tools to execute the strategies outlined above.\n\nBacklink Audit to see what websites link to yours\nBacklink Analytics to see who links to any website\nBacklink Gap to compare your linking websites with your competitors\nLink Building Tool to identify target websites for link building outreach\n\nRegularly tracking your linking sites can help you never miss an issue—or an opportunity. \n\nAccess Everything You Need to Find Out Who Links to Your Site\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
