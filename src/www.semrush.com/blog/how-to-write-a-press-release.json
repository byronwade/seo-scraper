  "content": "What Is a Press Release?\n\nA press release is a brief news article about your company that you can issue to news outlets and journalists. To attract public attention, protect your brand reputation, increase brand awareness, and more.\n\nHere’s an example of a press release about a new product issued by Wet Noses, a dog food company:\n\nA standard press release contains these sections:\n\nHeader with the company name and logo, a contact person, and any release date guidelines\nHeadline \nSubtitle (optional)\nDateline\nLead paragraph\nBody\nBoilerplate and end notation\n\nIn this article, we’ll teach you how to write a press release and walk you through each of the sections listed above. If you want to jumpstart the process, download our free standard press release template.\n\nCreate a Standard Press Release\n\nwith This Free Template\n\nTry it Free →\nTypes of Press Releases\n\nPress releases can be issued for occasions like:\n\nA new business (or new business location) opening\nA new leadership hire\nA new product or service launch\nAn upcoming event \nA new partnership\nA company rebranding\nWinning an industry award\nAn acquisition or merger taking place\n\nCompanies also put out statements about issues they might be facing. To inform the public about how they’re handling the situation and to protect the company’s public image during a crisis.\n\nHow to Write a Press Release\n\nWondering how to write a good press release? Here are six best practices.\n\nStep 1: Highlight the Basic Information for Journalists\n\nThe top of your press release should tell journalists who you are, how to get in touch with your public relations department, and when to issue the press release. To streamline communications and answer any initial questions.\n\nSo, be sure to include:\n\nA company logo: Place it at the top right corner\nYour company name: Place it at the top left corner\nA media contact person: List out their name, job title, phone number, and email address below the company name\nRelease date: The date you’re issuing the press release\nRelease guidelines: Instructions on when publications should release your news (more on this below)\n\nHere’s what this structure should look like (as shown in our template):\n\nLet’s have a look at what different release guidelines mean:\n\nFor immediate release: This press release should be shared with the public right away. This is also the default setting. Without any release guidelines, journalists will assume your statement is meant to be released immediately.\nFor release [date/time]: This press release isn’t time-sensitive and can be shared later\nEmbargoed until [date/time]: This press release contains sensitive information that journalists can’t release before the date and time specified by the company\nStep 2: Write an Attention-Grabbing Headline\n\nYour headline is the key element to capture attention—from both journalists and other readers. And can entice your target audience to read it.\n\nHere are some tips on crafting a good headline:\n\nInclude the core news element. Tell the reader right away why you’re issuing a press release\nKeep it concise. There’s no one-size-fits-all word count for headlines that you should aim for. But try to keep it short and to the point. Longer headlines are harder to read.\nSpeak to your audience. Choose an angle that your audience cares about. And write accordingly.\n\nDepending on the information you’re sharing, your headline may be simple. \n\nIn those cases, there’s no need to look for a special angle to captivate interest. Like this headline from Weibo’s release for the general meeting:\n\nOnce written, place the headline right below the contact information and release guidelines. Like this:\n\nOptionally, you can also add a subtitle or two below the headline if you want to highlight some important information that didn’t make it into the headline.\n\nStep 3: Ensure Location and Time Relevancy with a Dateline\n\nThe dateline indicates the date of the press release’s issuing, as well as the location the news is relevant to. \n\nIf you’re issuing a press release for immediate release, the date in the dateline should be the day you’re sending the release to journalists. But if the release is embargoed or can be released at a later date, the date in the dateline should reflect that.\n\nWhile the release date is only visible to journalists, the dateline will be published along with the press release. \n\nPlace the dateline at the beginning of your lead body paragraph, following this format:\n\n[Date, City, State]—Lead body paragraph\n\nLike this:\n\nWhat about businesses that have multiple locations?\n\nUnless your press release is specific to a single place, you should use your company’s headquarters as the location in your press releases.\n\nSome global companies like Shopify list “Internet, Everywhere” as the location in the dateline. This states that the information is relevant to their target audience regardless of their location.\n\nStep 4: Write a Strong Lead Paragraph\n\nThe lead paragraph (also called a “lede”) should contain the most important information about your news.\n\nThat could help you get coverage because journalists don’t have time to read through all of the press releases they receive. So, a compelling opening paragraph is more likely to get you noticed.\n\nAnd make sure you're writing your lead paragraph in a way that provides essential information by answering the five “W” questions:\n\nWho?\nWhat?\nWhere?\nWhen?\nWhy?\n\nSide note\n\nAdding in the “why?” in the lead paragraph is optional. If you want, you can put this in the body section instead. \n\nHere’s an example of a good lead paragraph from NASA:\n\nIt answers:\n\nWho? NASA\nWhat? Opportunities to see the moon pass in front of the sun during a solar eclipse and join NASA’s events\nWhere? In person or online (links available)\nWhen? April 8\n\nIn this case the “why” is implied: it’s a rare event.\n\nStep 5: Share Background in the Body Copy\n\nThe body of the press release is where you’ll expand on the information you introduced in the headline and lead paragraph. So additional context is there for those who wish to read it.\n\nThe body paragraph should dive deeper into the details you mentioned in the lede. And support your release with quotes, stats, stories, and more.\n\nBefore you start writing the body, organize all the material you’d like to mention. Like:\n\nExclusive data or research statistics\nQuotes and testimonials from key stakeholders\nThe story behind the release\nIndustry relevance\nUnique selling proposition (especially for announcing new products, services, and business opening)\nLinks to supporting evidence and articles\n\nThen, rank all the materials by their importance. Start with the most important piece and work your way down the list. \n\nFor example, if you’re promoting an event, the most important details are the event topic, date, time, location, venue, where and how to buy tickets, pricing, speakers, and similar.\n\nBut suppose you’re covering a new leadership hire. In that case, it’s essential to include the new hire’s previous career achievements, their qualifications, the role they’ll be taking on, and quotes from both the new hire and someone else from the leadership team.\n\nOnce you write the body, read through it and cut down on unnecessary information. While there’s no rule as to how long your press release should be, it’s a good idea to keep it to around 400 words.\n\nAnd end the body with a call to action relevant to your statement.\n\nFor instance, if you’re announcing a new location, invite the readers to visit it. And if you’re launching a new online product, encourage them to visit your site to find out more about the new offering.\n\nWhen you’re done writing, use the SEO Writing Assistant to review your press release for readability and tone of voice.\n\nJust copy and paste your test into the tool’s text editor, enter a few keywords, and select your target tone of voice—keep in mind that slightly more formal is typical for press releases.\n\nYou can click the pencil icon under “Tone of Voice” to adjust it.\n\nThen, the tool will flag areas where you need to adjust. \n\nReview Your PR Drafts in Real Time\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign up Now →\nStep 6: Include Boilerplate Information and an End Notation\n\nEnd with a boilerplate (an “About us” section) and an end notation (which is “###”). To make sure journalists have important information about your company and know they’ve reached the end. \n\nYour boilerplate should include:\n\nYour company name\nA stock symbol (for publicly traded companies)\nA short description of the company\nA unique value proposition\nAchievements and milestones (e.g., number of paying customers, locations, employees, specific awards and recognitions, etc.)\n\nLet’s have a look at a boilerplate example:\n\nIf your press release mentions more than one company, you should include boilerplates for each of the companies mentioned. You can also include contact information here.\n\nAdd the end notation at the very end. \n\nHow to Distribute a Press Release\n\nThere are several ways to get your press release published or covered:\n\nReleasing via newswires\nDistributing directly to journalists\nWorking with PR agencies or freelancers\n\nLet’s review each of these options below.\n\nReleasing via Newswires\n\nNewswires collect news reports and distribute them to organizations they collaborate with. Like newspapers, radio and TV stations, magazines, and others.\n\nThey’re simple to use. \n\nYou write a press release, send it to a newswire, and (often) pay a fee. \n\nThen, they put it up on their site (as shown below) and send it out to their network of partners.\n\nPopular newswires include PR Newswire, Business Wire, and Newswire.\n\nMany journalists keep track of newswires and pick up stories they find worth sharing from there.\n\nNewswires are easy to use, but they can be expensive. And distribution doesn’t guarantee coverage. \n\nDistributing Directly to Journalists\n\nAnother option is to send your news directly to journalists yourself to compel them to write an original article based on it. \n\nWhether this is the right option for you depends on the structure of your team and the volume of media outreach you’re planning to do.\n\nFor example, if you’re a one-person marketing “team” at a startup, you might struggle with an additional task on your plate.\n\nBut if you’re part of an in-house PR team, then you’re likely well-equipped to distribute the press release on your own.\n\nFollow these steps to execute this well:\n\nCreate a list of the publications relevant to your company\nFor each publication, find the news category your release fits into. For example, news from a camping gear company will fit into some of these categories depending on the publication: Lifestyle, Travel, Outdoors. \nRead through these sections to find examples of news that closely resembles yours\nNote the name of the journalist who wrote the story and read through their other articles\nSelect the journalists who seem most interested in the topic of your release and/or your industry/company\nFind their contact information and send them your press release\n\nPro tip\n\nOften, you’ll find journalists’ contact information on their author pages. You can usually find this page by clicking on the name of the author in the article you’re reading.\n \n\nDistributing directly to journalists can seem like a harder way to get your news published. But you may end up building valuable relationships with journalists who can help you get coverage more quickly down the line. \n\nEven receiving rejection emails can be a good thing. \n\nUse them as an opportunity to ask what kind of stories they want to publish in the future. Their answers will help you fine-tune your PR strategy.\n\nWorking with PR Agencies or Freelancers\n\nIf you want to take press release distribution off your plate, you can hire a PR agency or freelancer(s) to distribute them for you.\n\nOften, these businesses and individuals have strong media connections they’ve been building for years. So, journalists may also be more likely to respond to them.\n\nAnother benefit of working with agencies and freelancers is that they’re in touch with the latest media trends. And can advise you on which angles to take—or even handle the writing for you.\n\nOne disadvantage of outsourcing PR to external partners is that the media relationships they build remain theirs. So, if you end a collaboration with a PR partner, you might be left with little or no media contacts of your own. \n\nHow to Measure Your Press Release’s Success\n\nYou’ll want to measure performance to determine how successful your press release was. But which metrics to track will depend on your goals.\n\nSome good metrics to start with are:\n\nNumber of media mentions\nNumber of backlinks\nNumber of new leads\nWebsite traffic\n\nLet’s say you want to track media mentions. \n\nUse the Brand Monitoring app for this.\n\nOpen the tool, click “New query,” then select “Brand” from the drop-down menu.\n\nEnter your company’s name and the email address you want notifications to be sent to.\n\nScroll down and add your domain name to track backlinks, choose what type of source platforms you want to track, and more.\n\nOnce you set everything up, scroll down to the bottom and click “Create query.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of mentions that the tool sourced for you. This page will update automatically as soon as new coverage appears.\n\nClick “Analytics” to explore more detailed metrics.\n\nTo set up email digests, click the “Email notifications” tab.\n\nHere, you can select a frequency.
