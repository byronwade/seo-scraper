  "content": "We live in a mobile world.\n\nLast year 63 percent of Google’s US organic search traffic came from mobile devices.\nA study found that 154.4 million users accessed the Google Maps app in one month in 2018.\nGoogle reports that over 40% of people prefer to complete their entire shopping experience on mobile.\n\nIf you have a local business or multiple locations then your online local presence is key to success. \n\nYou cannot ignore Local SEO.\n\nLearning the steps of a local SEO strategy is key. Here is how to make sure people find the right information about your business, no matter which location.\n\nLocal SEO Basics: One Page for One Location\n\nI see many multi-location businesses that include all of their information on one master landing page. This is a big mistake for SEO.\n\nYou need to create separate, optimized pages for each business location.\n\nThese should not be identical. Include:\n\nThat location’s name, address, and phone number (NAP).\n\nLocation-specific content (staff information, testimonials, news, etc.).\n\nAn embedded Google Map.\n\nDescriptions of where and how to get to your business - including mentions of local landmarks that Google can connect as entities.\n\nLocation-specific comments and reviews from customers.\n\nLocation-specific Title Tags and Meta Descriptions.\n\nImages from inside your business and the team members that work there.\n\nIn order to automate the process and save hours, you can use local citation services to populate databases with all this information for you.\n\nSpotlight Your Business to Anyone from Everywhere\n\nTry Local SEO! →\n\nThink of your location pages as microsites that you can expand on to create relevant related content. You can set up your URL structure like this:\n\nwww.yourdomain.com/locations/location-a/testimonials\n\nwww.yourdomain.com/locations/location-b/testimonials\n\nwww.yourdomain.com/locations/location-a/directions\n\nYou should also optimize your content, title tags, meta descriptions, etc. with location-specific keywords. Apply a local business schema markup to each page so your business hours and other important information can appear in search results.\n\nLastly, make sure these pages are discoverable by Google. Google’s crawlers aren’t always able to find a page that’s only available through a search or branch finder on your site.\n\nIt is a simple process: once you have created your new landing pages, submit a Sitemap to Google.\n\nYou can create one for free using XML Sitemaps. Then in Google Search Console, go to Index > Sitemaps. You will be able to submit a sitemap there. To see how to do this, see this recent video by Google Webmasters (timestamped at 5:15).\n\nSubmitting a sitemap makes it easier for Google to find and index pages, and keep up with changes on your website.\n\nOptimize Your Google Business Profile\n\nIf you haven’t already, sign up for Google Business Profile. Here you will be able to create listings for individual business locations.\n\nAdd the URLs for each of your location pages to your business profile.\n\nFollow Google’s guidelines to optimize each of your location pages. Guidelines include:\n\nVerify each location\n\nList accurate hours\n\nAdd photos\n\nManage and respond to reviews\n\nAlso, keep in mind some important rules about multi-location listings:\n\nName consistency: The listed names for each of your locations must be consistent (e.g., “The Home Depot” shouldn’t be called “Home Depot at Springfield”).\n\nCategory consistency: All locations should include at least one category that represents the business as a whole (e.g., all “PetSmart” locations would have the category “Pet Supply Store”).\n\nHowever, these rules don’t apply if your business locations really do serve very different purposes.\n\nAn example of this would be McMenamins. It is a chain of brewpubs in Portland, OR, but some of its locations are also hotels.\n\nTheir listings reflect these differences:\n\nTo ensure your GBP listing is perfect, see these mistakes to avoid.\n\nUtilizing Google Business Profile Insights\n\nGoogle has been working hard in the last year to improve the data that they supply in Google Business Profile Insights. I have been particularly impressed with some of their more recent additions.\n\nThe new dashboard gives you valuable data that saves time when you have multiple locations to monitor.\n\nGoogle has even given us some of our keyword data back recently. Google Business Profile now shows us a month's worth of data on the queries that people used to find our business. In Google’s (not provided) world, this can be crucial in informing your Local SEO strategy.\n\nDig further and you can see data for:\n\nHow customers search for your business.\n\nWhere customers view your business (listing on search or listing on maps).\n\nCustomer actions (visits to your website, direction requests, and phone calls).\n\nUnlike older versions of Google Business Profile, you can now get that data for the last three months.\n\nWant more?\n\nYou can always save it into a Google sheet and keep it updated moving forwards.\n\nManage Your Citations\n\nMulti-location SEO involves managing mentions of your business around the web as well as on-page optimization.\n\nGoogle looks at how your name, address, and phone number (NAP) appear across the web, with or without links, to determine how to rank your business in local search.\n\nIf your listings are inconsistent, it can hurt your SEO.\n\nTo prevent this, you need to scour the web and make sure your NAP is consistent for each of your business locations. This includes making sure your business name isn’t annotated based on location (e.g., “Home Depot at Springfield”).\n\nLook for and fix your business listing on these popular aggregators:\n\nYelp\n\nYahoo Local\n\nBing Places\n\nFoursquare\n\nYellow Pages\n\nAlso, look for any local or industry directories that your business might appear in.\n\nYou can use a citation tracking tool like SEMrush’s Listing Management Tool to help with this. It searches the web for your business listings and evaluates how accurate they are for you:\n\nYou can quickly see where your citations are correct and where there are issues.\n\nYou can then dig into your data and see which citations are missing and which need updating.\n\nUnless you have an intern trying to keep all of this data up to date, it is going to get expensive. With the SEMrush Listing Management tool, you can have all the data distributed for $20 a month.\n\nSpotlight Your Business to Anyone from Everywhere\n\nTry Local SEO! →\n\nThis is a small price to pay when Moz reports that NAP consistency is one of the most important aspects of Local SEO.\n\nBuild Links to Each of Your Location Pages\n\nYou probably already know that backlinks pointing at your site are important for SEO. But now that you have many location-specific landing pages, you need to work to improve the PageRank of each of them.\n\nTo do this, develop a link-building strategy to focus on each of your pages. Here are a few ideas:\n\nBecome a Sponsor\n\nA popular tactic is to sponsor local events or participate in charities. This can help you build local links to your pages from the likes of colleges, event websites, and local news outlets.\n\nHost Events\n\nHosting events at your business locations is another great way to create a buzz about your business and build links in the process.\n\nHost Meetups\n\nIf you want to do something a little less formal, you could host a meetup. It’s simple and free to create using a service like Meetup.com\n\nStart Content Marketing\n\nCreate valuable local content that people would be interested in reading and sharing. Host a blog on each microsite to attract interest and links, then use email marketing, social media marketing, and paid ads (where appropriate) to disseminate your content.\n\nContent marketing and SEO go hand-in-hand: the more pages of content you have, the more opportunities for link building.\n\nEvent Sponsorship\n\nIf you have a budget for your Local SEO campaign, you might want to consider local event sponsorship.\n\nThis doesn't have to be related to your industry, but it is important that it is local.\n\nLocal links aid Local SEO.\n\nStructured Data for Local \n\nIf you have a local business, structured data can be extremely beneficial. It is a language search engines understand. When a Google user does a search for a business in a specific city, they are often provided a Google Map panel with listings, or a carousel of related options. You want your business to show up in these featured areas, and the best way to do that is to use structured data.\n\nHere is a picture Google provided showing how your local business can appear in a search.\n\nI am not going to break down everything you need to know about schema. However, I will say you need to review schema.org/LocalBusiness. Google recommends that webmasters define each local business location as a Local Business type. Here are some resources to learn about and help you with schema markup:\n\nWhat is Schema? Beginner‘s Guide to Structured Data\n\nGoogle - Structured Data for Developers\n\nGoogle - Structured Data Guidelines\n\nGoogle - Understand How Structured Data Works\n\nStructured Data Testing Tool\n\nStructured Data Markup Helper\n\nStructured Data: SEO Mythbusting\n\nHow to Use Schema for Local SEO: A Complete Guide\nManage Reviews\n\nLast but not least, managing reviews for each business location is an important key to success.\n\nChain businesses often focus on garnering reviews and testimonials for their business overall, forgetting about location-specific feedback.\n\nIgnoring this can break your local SEO.\n\nGoogle displays reviews right along with your business listing in search results:\n\nIf you don’t work to encourage positive reviews and do damage control for negative ones, a lot of people will never bother clicking on your business listing.\n\nSo how do you deal with bad reviews?\n\nRespond quickly, but make sure you give a considered a calm and professional response.\n\nMake sure you don’t blame the customer.\n\nMake sure that the language you use can't be deemed inflammatory.\n\nHow do you get good reviews?\n\nInclude calls-to-action at your physical business locations and on your location pages to encourage customers to leave reviews.\nYou could use a widget like the one that Bright Local provides - especially handy if you don't have a developer or the ability to code.\nYou can even make it easier by creating a QR code for each location’s page and displaying it at that location. (Although QR codes have fallen out of popularity! Do this at your own risk.)\nWhen negative reviews do come up, try to resolve the issue and make that customer a happy one.\n\nI won’t lie, local SEO for multiple locations can be a lot of work to set up and maintain. But the payoff is worth it – if you take the time to develop an attractive SEO strategy that helps local searchers find exactly what they are looking for.\n\nIs your SEO strategy attracting customers to your multi-location business?
