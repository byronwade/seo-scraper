  "content": "What Is a Sitemap?\n\nA sitemap is a file that shows the structure of your website, including its pages and content. And the relationships between them. \n\nOne type is intended to help search engines crawl your site more efficiently. Another type is intended to help users better navigate your website. \n\nWhy Do You Need a Website Sitemap?\n\nThe larger and more complex your website is, the more difficult it can be for both users and search engines to navigate. But sitemaps make it easier.\n\nAll this means sitemaps are important. Because they can lead to:\n\nBetter discoverability: An XML sitemap (more on this in the next section) helps search engines discover important pages on your website. This is particularly helpful for large websites that have thousands of pages and may be impacted by a limited crawl budget.\nFaster indexation: For newer websites, submitting an XML sitemap can lead to more pages ranking sooner. And for websites that update existing content, Google can discover those changes sooner when they’re included in the sitemap. \nImproved user experience: HTML sitemaps (more on this in the next section) can make it easier for users to find exactly what content they’re looking for. Because they’re able to see all your most important pages in one place. \n\nDifferent sitemaps offer different benefits, so let’s discuss those next.\n\nWhat Are the Different Types of Website Sitemaps?\n\nThere are two types of sitemaps:\n\nXML sitemaps: Sitemaps written in a specific format designed for search engine crawlers\nHTML sitemaps: Sitemaps that look like regular pages and help users navigate the website\nXML Sitemaps\n\nExtensible Markup Language (XML) sitemaps are the preferred format for search engines like Google. \n\nThey provide three main types of information to search engines:\n\nThe list of all the URLs you want to have indexed\nThe “lastmod” attribute that informs when the URLs were last updated\nThe \"hreflang\" attribute that reveals local variants of the URLs\n\nThese sitemaps look something like this:\n\nWhile XML sitemaps are especially suitable for large websites, websites with extensive archives, or new websites with few links, every website can benefit from having one. \n\nPlus, it only takes a few minutes to create one.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nXML Sitemap: What It Is & How to Generate One\nWordPress Sitemap: How to Create, Check, and Submit One\nHTML Sitemaps\n\nHTML sitemaps used to be a popular way to improve a website's navigation and provide links to all your important pages in one place.\n\nHere's an example of an HTML sitemap from H&M Group:\n\nAs you can see, it’s a standard page with links to various pages organized in a hierarchical way.\n\nAlthough HTML sitemaps aren’t that common anymore, some voices in the SEO community still say they’re a must. Because HTML sitemaps can improve your internal linking and provide another layer of navigation for complex websites with many pages.\n\nBut don’t use an HTML sitemap as a replacement for good site navigation elements (such as menus, footer links, breadcrumbs, categories, etc.). \n\nGoogle’s John Mueller spoke to this on Mastodon:\n\nIf you feel the need for an HTML sitemap, spend the time improving your site's architecture instead.\n\nIn other words, users shouldn’t need a sitemap to effectively navigate your website. \n\nHow to Find a Sitemap\n\nHere are some effective ways to find a sitemap on a website:\n\nNote\n\nWhen we talk about sitemaps in the context of SEO, we usually mean XML sitemaps. From now on, we’ll talk about XML sitemaps in this guide. \n\nManual Check\n\nThe easiest way to find an XML sitemap is to look for it manually. Most commonly, a website’s XML sitemap will be located at this URL address: “https://domain.com/sitemap.xml.”\n\nQuite often—especially if the website uses WordPress and the Yoast SEO plugin—you'll be redirected to a sitemap index (/sitemap_index.xml).\n\nIn that case, it’ll look like this:\n\nAs you can see, a sitemap index is a simple file that lists all the sitemaps a website has. (Yes, there can be multiple sitemaps.) \n\nTo see the actual sitemap, just click the link to the specific sitemap in the index.\n\nSearch Operators\n\nSearch operators are special commands you can add to search queries to return more specific results.\n\nHere are some search operators you can use to find a website’s sitemap:\n\n“site:[domain.com] filetype:xml”\n“site:[domain.com] inurl:sitemap”\n“site:[domain.com] intitle:sitemap”\n\nSimply enter the operator into the search bar and replace “domain.com” with the actual website's address. \n\nThe search results should return the location of the website sitemap—if it exists and the search engine you’re using has indexed it.\n\nGoogle Search Console\n\nIf you have access to your website's Google Search Console (GSC), there's a chance the sitemap has been submitted there.\n\nHead to the “Sitemaps” report in the “Indexing” section of the left menu.\n\nHere, you'll see a section called “Submitted sitemaps.” \n\nIf someone has submitted an XML sitemap before, you'll find its URL in the list.\n\nNote\n\nWe'll talk about submitting a sitemap to Google Search Console later in this guide. \n\nRobots.txt\n\nA robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which sections of the website they should crawl and which they should avoid. \n\nIt should go in the root folder of your site: “https://domain.com/robots.txt.”\n\nIf the robots.txt file follows best practices, it’ll link to the website sitemap. Just search for “sitemap” within the robots.txt file.\n\nThe section linking to a sitemap will look something like this:\n\nTip\n\nIf you've tried all the ways mentioned above and couldn't locate your XML sitemap, your website probably doesn't have one. So, read our guide to XML sitemaps to learn how to create one or use a sitemap generator. \n\nHow to Review Your Sitemap for Issues\n\nTo ensure your sitemap is set up correctly, use Semrush’s Site Audit.\n\nThe tool will crawl your website (similar to the way Googlebot does) and detect any problems related to your sitemap (if present). And will also check for other technical issues on your site. \n\nTo begin, add your homepage URL to the text bar. Then, click “Start Audit.”\n\nNext, choose your settings for the audit. \n\nFollow our detailed setup guide if you need help.\n\nNext, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nOnce the audit is complete, you’ll arrive at the tool's “Overview” report. Here’s what it looks like:\n\nClick the “Issues” tab. Then, search for “sitemap” in the text box. \n\nYou'll get a list of issues related to your sitemap.xml file. \n\nAddress “Errors” first, then move on to “Warnings” and “Notices.”\n\nSome common sitemap-related issues include:\n\nSitemap has format errors: There are format errors (like missing XML tags) in your sitemap file\nIncorrect pages found in a sitemap: Your sitemap contains pages that aren’t supposed to be in a sitemap (like pages with redirects or pages that aren’t canonical versions)\nSitemap files are too large: Your sitemap exceeds Google's size limit (more than 50MB or more than 50,000 URLs) \nSitemap not indicated in robots.txt: Your robots.txt file doesn’t indicate the path to your sitemap. Including this path is a best practice because it directs search engines to your sitemap. And facilitates faster and more complete indexing.\nSitemap not found: The sitemap URL provided returns a 404 error. This could be due to a typo in the sitemap URL, the sitemap not being uploaded, or it being placed in the wrong directory.\nHTTP URLs in sitemap for HTTPS site: Your sitemap contains HTTP URLs on an HTTPS site. All URLs should be HTTPS to prevent duplicate content issues and security warnings in browsers.\nOrphaned pages in sitemaps: These are pages that are listed in the sitemap but don’t have any internal links pointing to them from other pages on the site. This makes it hard to find them and can limit those pages’ ability to rank well.\n\nClick one of the links with the number of affected pages to see a full list of pages with that specific issue.\n\nNext, click “Why and how to fix it” next to each type of issue. \n\nThis will open a window with an explanation of the problem. And tips on how to fix it. \n\nGo through the list and implement the necessary changes. \n\nThen, rerun the audit to confirm that all issues have been successfully resolved. \n\nFind and Fix Sitemap Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nHow to Submit a Sitemap to Google\n\nSubmitting your XML sitemap to Google is an SEO best practice. \n\nWhy?\n\nIt can speed up the process of Google discovering your sitemap\nIt can help you detect issues with your sitemap\n\nSubmit your sitemap in Google Search Console. (If you don't have an account yet, create one so you can log in to GSC.) \n\nTo submit your sitemap, go to the \"Sitemaps\" report. You'll find it in the \"Indexing\" section of the left menu.\n\nThere, enter your XML sitemap’s URL in the “Add a new sitemap” section. And click the “Submit” button.\n\nAfter you've submitted your sitemap, you'll get a message like this:\n\nFor a more in-depth guide, read our post on how to submit a sitemap to Google.\n\nMonitor the status of your sitemap anytime you visit the report. If there's a green “Success” message, you're all good.\n\nIf there's an issue with your sitemap, you'll see a red “Couldn't fetch” or “Has errors” status. In this case, the report will provide a detailed explanation of what went wrong and how to fix it.\n\nCheck the full list of possible errors and how to fix them in Google’s guide to the “Sitemaps” report. \n\nFAQs\n\nBelow are some common questions related to sitemaps. With answers and additional resources.\n\nDo I Need a Sitemap for a Small Website?\n\nGoogle states that websites with 500 or fewer pages may not need a sitemap. But only if all of the pages are properly linked and discoverable by search engine crawlers.\n\nThat said, there are no downsides to having an XML sitemap. And if your website regularly updates content for SEO purposes, a sitemap can speed up the process of Google finding those changes.\n\nWhat Shouldn’t Be Included in a Sitemap?\n\nAll of the pages listed in your sitemap should show Google that your site is high-quality and well-maintained.\n\nThat means you should leave out some pages. Such as:\n\nPages with 3xx, 4xx, or 5xx status codes\nOrphaned pages\nDuplicate pages\nPages that aren’t the canonical version\nPages with a “noindex” robots tag\nPages blocked in your robots.txt file \nHow Big Is Too Big for a Sitemap?\n\nA single sitemap should be limited to 50MB or 50,000 URLs. \n\nGoogle encourages users to follow best practices outlined by sitemaps.org. \n\nIf yours exceeds the size limits, you’ll need to split up your sitemap.\n\nThen, create and submit a sitemap index file to Google. So it can identify all of your sitemaps.\n\nHow Often Should You Generate a Sitemap?\n\nThe more often you update and publish new content, the more often you should generate a sitemap.\n\nAs a general rule, we recommend auditing your sitemap once per month. If you publish multiple pieces of content per day, you may need to update your sitemap on a weekly basis.\n\nJust keep an eye out for errors. Which is easy with the Site Audit tool.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →",
