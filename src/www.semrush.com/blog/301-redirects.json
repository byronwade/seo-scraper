  "content": "What Is a 301 Redirect?\n\nA 301 redirect is a permanent redirection from one URL to another, used to maintain search engine rankings and user access when a webpage's URL changes. It signals to search engines and browsers that the original URL has been permanently replaced with a new one.\n\nFor example: \n\nWe updated a blog post and redirected it to a new URL. \n\nFrom https://www.semrush.com/blog/wordpress-seo/ to https://www.semrush.com/blog/wordpress-seo/. \n\n(If you click on the old URL, you’ll be automatically redirected to the new page). \n\nWe did this because we wanted the page to follow URL best practices. \n\nBut that’s far from the only reason to use a 301 redirect. \n\nTip: To quickly find redirect issues on your site, run a quick audit with Site Audit. And you’ll see it right there on the dashboard:\n\n301 vs 302 Redirect\n\nThe main difference between a 301 and a 302 redirect is that 301 redirects are permanent and 302 redirects are temporary. \n\n301 is the most common type. It takes visitors to the new URL and tells search engines the redirect is permanent. \n\nA 302 redirect, on the other hand, also takes visitors to the new URL but tells search engines the redirect is only temporary.\n\nWhen Should You Use a 301 Redirect?\n\nThere are different types of redirects (301, 302, meta refresh, etc.). And each has its own specific use case. \n\nHere’s when (and why) you should use a 301 permanent redirect versus another type.\n\nPermanently Moving a Page to a New URL\n\nFor example, from https://www.website.com/old-page-name/ to https://www.website.com/new-page-name/.\n\nSometimes, you need to change the URL of a page on your site.\n\nMaybe a product name has changed slightly and you need to update the URL. Or want to better categorize your site's pages. The reasons are endless. \n\nImplementing a 301 redirect will ensure that users and search engines are redirected to the new URL. And help search engines pass the SEO power of the old URL to the new URL. \n\nDeleting a Page\n\nIf, for any reason, you want to delete a page on your site, you should redirect it to another relevant page if at all possible. \n\nWhy?\n\nIt creates a better user experience. And gives people an alternative. \n\nFor example, if you simply delete the page, users who click on a link to the page in search or on another webpage will land on a page like this:\n\nWithout an alternative, the user will likely bounce. \n\nYour best bet, in most cases, is to use a 301 redirect to send the user to a similar page with the same intent on your site.\n\nMigrating Your Site to a New Domain\n\nFor example, from https://www.website.com to https://www.newwebsite.com.\n\nYou may also want to migrate your site to a new domain entirely. \n\nSay you’re migrating from a .net to a .com. Or maybe you’ve rebranded and need to move to a different domain name.\n\nA 301 redirect is the best way to do that. And notify Google using Google Search Console's Change of Address tool.\n\nChanging Your Site Structure\n\nFor example, from https://www.website.com/old-category/post/ to https://www.website.com/new-category/post/.\n\nIf you want to change your site's structure to make it easier to organize your content and for Google to understand how your pages are related, opt for 301 redirects.\n\nThe same applies to changing any subfolder structure on your site. \n\nWhether that’s blog categories, ecommerce categories, or other folders. A permanent redirect is the best way to implement the change. \n\nMoving From Non-WWW to WWW URLs (or Resolving Duplication Issues)\n\nFor example, from https://www.website.com to https://website.com.\n\nYou need to make sure the main version of your site is either non-www or www. \n\nDoing so will make your site appear more consistent to users and search engines. And avoid duplication issues. \n\nThe best way to make this clear is to use a 301 redirect to indicate which is the main version. And redirect users and search engines to your preferred version. \n\nSwitching From HTTP to HTTPS\n\nFor example, from http://www.website.com to https://www.website.com. \n\nIf you want to switch from HTTP to HTTPS (because it’s more secure and one of Google’s ranking signals), use a 301 redirect. \n\nDoing so will ensure Google properly indexes the new protocol. And that users are redirected to the right pages. \n\nMerging Two (or More) Domains\n\nFor example, from https://www.website.de to https://www.website.com/de/.\n\nSometimes, companies will need to merge one domain with another. This is common after business mergers and acquisitions. \n\nThis process requires exhaustive planning. But, for simplicity’s sake, if we’re talking about merging, the way to keep as much SEO power as possible is to merge using a 301 redirect. \n\nResolving 'Trailing Slash' Issues\n\nFor example, from https://www.website.com/page-name to https://www.website.com/page-name/.\n\nVariants of a URL with and without a trailing slash are actually different pages. And Google will see them that way. \n\nYou need to make sure your site uses a consistent approach to handling trailing slashes on page URLs. The correct way to do this is to 301 redirect one to the other. \n\nResolving Upper-Case vs. Lower-Case Issues\n\nFor example from https://www.website.com/Page-Name/ to https://www.website.com/page-name/.\n\nJust as with trailing slashes, upper- and lower-case URLs can be considered different pages. \n\nEven one capitalized letter in a URL can make it different from its lower-case counterpart. And search engines may see it as a duplicate.\n\nUsing 301 redirects is usually the best way to resolve these issues.\n\nNote: Generally speaking, it makes sense to use lower-case for your URLs and not to mix upper-case and lower-case. \n\nHow to Do a 301 Redirect\n\nThe way you implement a 301 redirect depends on your server and the content management system (CMS) you use. \n\nHere’s how to do a 301 redirect across some of the common setups.\n\nTip: Remember to run a site audit after implementing redirects to make sure everything is running smoothly. \n\n301 Redirects on WordPress Sites\n\nImplementing WordPress redirects is relatively simple and straightforward, compared to other available redirect methods.\n\nIf you have a WordPress website, consider using a plugin before trying any of the other redirect methods on this list.\n\nIf you’re using the Yoast SEO Premium plugin, you’ll find a built-in redirects manager you can use to implement redirects.\n\nIf you’re using the free version or another plugin that doesn't offer redirects, you’ll need to install a dedicated redirects plugin. \n\nRedirection is among the most popular redirect managers for WordPress. You can add your redirects in minutes. \n\nLike so:\n\nIf you’re using an alternative like Rank Math, you'll find a redirect manager included within the plugin.\n\n301 Redirects on Shopify Stores\n\nAs with WordPress, implementing 301 redirections on a Shopify store is relatively simple and straightforward.\n\nTo do so, head to Sales channels > Online Store > Navigation\n\nYou’ll see a discreet “View URL redirects” link in the top-right corner. Go ahead and click it.\n\nNext, click “Create URL redirect.”\n\nIt is then as simple as adding your “from” and “to” URLs and saving the redirect. \n\n301 Redirects on BigCommerce\n\nIf you’re running a store on BigCommerce, here is how to add 301 redirects:\n\nNavigate to Settings › 301 Redirects.\n\nAnd add a redirect, including your old URL.\n\nChoose a manual link, where you enter the new URL to redirect to. \n\nOr dynamic link, where you select a page or category, and the redirect will automatically update if you change this page later.\n\nEnter your new page's URL or choose a page to redirect to if you selected the dynamic link option above.\n\n301 Redirects on Magento Stores\n\nIf your ecommerce store runs on Magento, the functionality to add 301 redirects is built right into the platform.\n\nHere is how to create them:\n\nMagento 1\n\nIf you are running Magento 1, navigate to Catalog > URL Rewrite Management\n\nYou’ll see any redirects that have previously been created.\n\nGo ahead and “Create URL Rewrite.”\n\nAnd select “Custom” rewrite.\n\nThen, fill out the required URL rewrite information.\n\nLike so:\n\nID Path = The name of your rewrite that's used for admin purposes only.\n\nRequest Path = The original / from URL\n\nTarget Path = The new / target URL\n\nRedirect = Permanent (301)\n\nDescription = Any description you want to add for the redirect\n\nMagento 2\n\nFor Magento 2, first navigate to “URL Rewrites”:\n\nMarketing > SEO & Search > URL Rewrites\n\nGo ahead and “Add URL Rewrite” and fill out the required information.\n\nLike this:\n\nCreate URL Rewrite: Custom\n\nStore = The store you want to add the redirect for\n\nRequest Path = The original / from URL\n\nTarget Path = The new / target URL\n\nRedirect Type = Permanent (301)\n\nDescription = Any description you want to add for the redirect\n\n301 Redirects on Apache Servers\n\nWarning: This 301 redirect method is only meant for experts. Mistakes here can cause big problems for your website. If you’re not an expert, proceed with extreme caution or reach out to an expert who can help.\n\nIf your site runs on an Apache server, you can edit your site's .htaccess file to implement redirects.\n\nTo add a redirect to the file, add a line that tells the server what to do. You’ll add your new rules immediately under “RewriteEngine On,” which you can find in the mod_rewrite module in Apache.\n\nOnce you’ve located the right place to add a new rule, use the following examples to do the following:\n\nRedirect a Single Page\nRRedirect 301 /oldpage/ https://www.example.com/newpage/\nRedirect an Entire Domain to Another\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.example.com/$1 [R=301,L]\nRedirect an Entire Site to a Subfolder\nRedirect 301 / https://www.website.com/subfolder/\nRedirect a Subfolder to a Different Domain\nRedirect 301 /subfolder https://www.newwebsite.com/\nRedirect a Site Directory After a URL Change\nOptions +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On RewriteRule \n^(.*)/old-category/(.*)$ $1/new-category/$2 [R,L]\nRedirect From Non-WWW to WWW\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\\. [NC]\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]\nRedirect From HTTP to HTTPS\nRewriteCond %{https} off\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.example.com/$1 [R=301,L]\nRedirect to Trailing-Slash URLs\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f \nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(.*)/$ \nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.website.com/$1/ [R=301,L]\n301 Redirects on Nginx \n\nWarning: This 301 redirect method is only meant for experts. Mistakes here can cause big problems for your website. If you’re not an expert, proceed with extreme caution or reach out to an expert who can help.\n\nTo create a permanent 301 redirect on Nginx, you need to add a line to your .conf file that is typically found in the root of your server. \n\nSome of the common lines you might need to use are as follows:\n\nRedirect a Single Page\nserver {\n# Permanent redirect to an individual page\nrewrite ^/old-page$ http://www.website.com/new-page permanent;\n}\nRedirect an Entire Domain to Another\nserver {\nlisten 80;\nlisten 443 ssl;\nserver_name devisers.in www.devisers.in;\nreturn 301 $scheme://www.devisers.com$request_uri;\n}\nRedirect from HTTP to HTTPS\nserver {\nlisten 80;\nserver_name website.com www.website.com;\nreturn 301 https://website.com$request_uri;\n}\nRedirect From Non-WWW to WWW\nserver {\nlisten 80;\nlisten 443 ssl;\nserver_name devisers.in;\nreturn 301 $scheme://www.devisers.in$request_uri;\n}\n301 Redirects on a Windows Server \n\nWarning: This 301 redirect method is only meant for experts. Mistakes here can cause big problems for your website. If you’re not an expert, proceed with extreme caution or reach out to an expert who can help.\n\nIf your site runs on a Windows server in ASP.NET, you need to add redirects into the web.config file in the site root.\n\nHere’s how to implement the most common 301 redirections:\n\nRedirect a Single Page\n<configuration>\n<location path=\"old-page\">\n<system.webServer>\n<httpRedirect enabled=\"true\" destination=\"http://www.website.com/new-page/\" httpResponseStatus=\"Permanent\" />\n</system.webServer>\n</location>\n</configuration>\nRedirect An Entire Domain to Another\n<system.webServer>\n<httpRedirect enabled=\"true\" destination=\"http://www.newwebsite.com/\" />\n</system.webServer>\nRedirect from HTTP to HTTPS\n<configuration>\n<system.webServer>\n<rewrite>\n<rules>\n<rule name=\"HTTP to HTTPS redirect\" stopProcessing=\"true\"> \n<match url=\"(.*)\" /> \n<conditions> \n<add input=\"{HTTPS}\" pattern=\"off\" ignoreCase=\"true\" />\n</conditions> \n<action type=\"Redirect\" redirectType=\"Permanent\" url=\"https://{HTTP_HOST}/{R:1}\" />\n</rule> \n</rules>\n</rewrite>\n</system.webServer>\n</configuration>\nRedirect from Non-WWW to WWW\n<rewrite>\n<rules>\n<rule name=\"Redirect http://website.com to http://www.website.com HTTP\" patternSyntax=\"ECMAScript\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\n<match url=\".*\"></match>\n<conditions>\n<add input=\"{HTTP_HOST}\" pattern=\"^website.com$\"></add>\n<add input=\"{HTTPS}\" pattern=\"off\"></add>\n</conditions>\n<action type=\"Redirect\" url=\"http://www.website.com/{R:0}\" redirectType=\"Permanent\" appendQueryString=\"true\"></action>\n</rule>\n</rules>\n</rewrite> \nHow to Use 301 Redirects to Boost Your SEO Performance\n\n301 redirects can help you overcome issues that hold back your site's organic visibility. Or make the most out of opportunities to drive growth. \n\nHere are some of the most common ways 301s can be used to boost your SEO performance:\n\nMigrate Your Blog From a Subdomain to a Subfolder\n\nThis is one of the most common ways to use 301 redirects for quick SEO wins.\n\nA subdomain is like a child of the parent domain. And is often used to host blogs and stores. \n\nFor example, blog.yourdomain.com \n\nAnd a subfolder is part of your main domain. Like any other page. \n\nFor example, yourdomain.com/blog/\n\nThe thing is: \n\nGoogle can treat your subdomain as a separate entity from your main domain. \n\nWhich means Google might not take into account all the valuable content on your subdomain and its valuable assets (like backlinks) when evaluating your primary domain. \n\nSo, to help you potentially rank better and drive more traffic, it might make sense to redirect your blog from a subdomain to a subfolder. \n\nNote: Every website is different, so don’t redirect a subdomain to a subfolder without first doing your research to make sure that would be a beneficial move.\n\nResolve Keyword Cannibalization Issues\n\nKeyword cannibalization is when two (or more) pages are showing up in Google for the same or highly similar keywords and competing against each other. Google doesn’t know which pages should rank higher for which keywords.\n\nYou don’t want that. \n\nAnd the simplest way to fix cannibalization issues is often to redirect the lowest-performing page to the other. \n\nBy low-performing, we mean the one with fewer backlinks, lower ranking, lower traffic, etc. \n\nYou can quickly find cannibalization issues using Semrush’s Position Tracking tool. Under the cannibalization tab. \n\nMerge Multiple Websites Into One\n\nSometimes businesses run on multiple sites.\n\nLet's say you run a hotel chain and have a different website for each hotel. It might make sense to merge these all into one.\n\nJust like Marriott does. \n\nAgain, the goal is to combine the authority and equity of multiple domain properties into one, resulting in a stronger site that drives quick wins. \n\nNote: This solution may not work in the same way for every website or business. Do your own research before moving forward with a website-merging or redirecting project.\n\nCommon 301 Redirect Mistakes & How to Avoid Them\n\nHere’s how to find and fix the most common issues with 301 redirects. \n\nAllowing Pages to 404\n\nDon’t let pages return a 404 error if you can reasonably avoid it. It creates a terrible user experience. And can hurt your SEO performance. \n\nTo avoid running into this issue, run an audit on your site every month. \n\nIf you use Semrush’s Site Audit, you’ll see pages returning a 4XX status code under the “Issues” tab. \n\nRedirect all 404 pages to other pages that are related and/or serve the same or a similar purpose. \n\nUsing 302 Instead of 301 Redirects\n\nA common issue among SEOs is not knowing whether you should apply the 301 redirect vs. 302. \n\n301 redirects should be used when the change is permanent. And 302s when the change is only temporary.\n\nAgain, Site Audit can help you find these. You’ll see them as “URLs with a temporary redirect.”\n\nUnless they’re really temporary, update these redirects to 301s. \n\nUsing JavaScript for Redirection Without a Proper Setup\n\n301 redirects are server-side. And JavaScript redirects are client-side. Meaning they tell the browser to get the content from a different location. \n\nYou might want to use JavaScript for redirects if you don’t have access to your server configuration or .htaccess file, are running an A/B test, or have other specific needs. \n\nBut do note that they aren’t the optimal choice. \n\nSearch engines need to render a page to find the redirect. And if, for example, Google can’t crawl a site’s JS file, the page can’t be rendered. \n\nUsing a 301, 302, or 307 redirect instead of a JavaScript redirect is typically recommended to avoid any issues.\n\nUsing Redirects Rather Than Updating Broken Internal Links\n\nIt can be tempting to fix broken internal links by redirecting the link to another page. But over time, this can create another issue: a redirect chain. (More on that later.)\n\nInstead, update the target of the broken link first. Then, and only then, add a redirect to the correct page. \n\nYou can find broken internal links in Site Audit, under the “Issues” tab. \n\nRedirect Chains & Loops\n\nA redirect chain happens when there are two or more redirects between the first URL and the final URL. \n\nAnd a redirect loop is when a URL is redirected to another, which in turn redirects back to the initial URL. Leading to an infinite loop of redirects. \n\nBoth of these issues are detrimental to your site’s user experience and, potentially, your SEO performance. \n\nTo fix them, first find any chains and loops.\n\nThen, replace the internal links to redirected pages with links to the final URL. And update existing redirects to point directly to the final, most current URL.\n\nAgain, you can easily find redirect chains and loops in Site Audit, under the “Issues” tab. \n\nLike so:\n\nMonitor Your 301 Redirects and Technical SEO\n\nFinding and fixing 301 redirect issues is just one of the many steps to improve your technical SEO. \n\nBut, if you start addressing the items above, you’ll be on your way to higher rankings.
