Choose the Right Topic\n\nYour infographic should be relevant and valuable to your target audience (the people your content is for).\n\nIt should:\n\nAnswer questions\nSolve problems\nOffer new insights\n\nAsk yourself these questions to achieve that:\n\nWho is your audience?\nWhat kind of information would be helpful to them?\nWhat problems can you help them solve with an infographic?\n\nYou can leverage Semrush’s Topic Research tool to brainstorm ideas and find relevant topics that are worth covering in the form of infographics.\n\nHere’s how to do that:\n\nLet’s say you’re in the health and fitness niche.\n\nAnd you want to create something around nutrition.\n\nFirst, enter your main theme, such as “nutrition,” in the search bar. You can also specify your target location if your content is for a specific geographic audience.\n\nThen, click the “Get content ideas” button:\n\nThe tool will generate subtopics related to your main theme.\n\nIn our case, the main theme was “nutrition.” So, we see subtopics like “healthy food,” “nutritional facts,” etc.:\n\nClick on each subtopic to see popular questions people ask about that specific topic:\n\nThese questions can inspire infographic content that addresses your audience’s queries.\n\nFind Content Ideas for Infographics\n\nwith our Topic Research tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Conduct Comprehensive Research\n\nConduct comprehensive research to get a deeper understanding of your topic.\n\nThat’s a crucial step in crafting an effective infographic. Because it ensures that your content is accurate, relevant, and valuable to your target audience.\n\nHere’s how you can use the Keyword Magic Tool for your research:\n\nLet’s take our nutrition example.\n\nFirst, type “nutrition” into the search bar and click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will generate a list of ideas you can explore in your infographic:\n\nYou can further use the filters to refine your search and generate even more focused keyword ideas. For example, if you click on “Questions”:\n\nThis will generate questions people ask about nutrition.\n\nYou demonstrate your expertise and understanding of the industry by directly addressing common queries or concerns.\n\nThis can position you as a go-to resource for valuable, accurate information. And also foster a sense of reliability and credibility with your audience.\n\nNext, you can also use “Intent” to filter the results. So you can quickly find keywords related to your informational needs.\n\nIn our case, if we want to curate an infographic about nutritional facts, we’d click on “Informational” in the “Intent” section:\n\nAfter analyzing related keywords, questions people ask, and the intent behind them, you’ll end up with phrases like: “What is nutrition,” “Why is nutrition important,” and “Watermelon nutrition facts.”\n\nAnd your nutritional facts infographic could have the following information on it:\n\nWhat is nutrition\nWhy is nutrition important\nNutritional facts about watermelon, bananas, avocados, etc.\n\nResearch Infographic Topics\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Pick the Right Type of Infographic Design\n\nAfter you’ve gathered insights for your infographic, it’s time to choose the type of infographic you’ll use.\n\nBase your decision on the nature of the information you’ll be sharing in your infographic.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf the information is primarily statistics, then consider using statistical infographics. If you’re trying to convey a particular process, use process infographics.\n\nOnce you’ve decided on the type of infographic, start organizing your information so it flows logically.\n\nYou can use many of the following elements to organize your information in an infographic:\n\nLists\nTables\nCharts\nGraphs\nDiagrams\nTimelines\nPictograms\n\nThis is how an infographic looks after all the information is organized:\n\n4. Understand Visual Hierarchy\n\nVisual hierarchy is a design principle that helps you arrange elements in a way that draws the viewer’s attention to the most important information first.\n\nHere are five ways to use visual hierarchy effectively in your infographic design:\n\nSize: One of the simplest ways to establish a visual hierarchy is through size. Larger elements naturally draw more attention and appear more important. Use this to your advantage by making key points or critical data bigger in your infographic.\nColor: You can also use colors to establish hierarchy. Bright or contrasting colors stand out. Muted tones blend into the background. Use bold colors for important info and lighter shades for secondary details.\nPositioning: People notice elements at the top of a page or along the natural reading path first. So, place key information along these paths. This ensures it receives the attention it deserves. \nTypography: Different fonts and text styles can also create a sense of hierarchy. Bold, large, or unique typefaces stand out and show importance. Smaller fonts work well for less essential details or supporting information.\nWhitespace: Whitespace (empty space) can separate and highlight important elements. Provide breathing room around critical points. This makes them stand out and keeps your infographic from appearing cluttered.\n5. Make Smart Color Choices\n\nColors evoke emotions and direct attention.\n\nThat’s why you should select a color scheme that aligns with your brand and message.\n\nHere are three tips for effective color choices in your infographic design:\n\nUse the 60-30-10 rule. Choose three harmonizing colors in a ratio of approximately 60%-30%-10%. Your primary color should take up about 60% of the infographic. The secondary color about 30%. Apply the accent color to the remaining 10% of elements.\nChoose complementary colors. Choose a harmonious color palette. Choose colors that go well together for a harmonious design. Instead of using conflicting shades.\nUnderstand color psychology. Colors can stir emotions and ignite ideas. Blue symbolizes trustworthiness and stability. Yellow represents optimism and energy. Think about the message you want to convey when selecting infographic colors.\n6. Pay Attention to Typography\n\nFonts play a crucial role in readability and mood.\n\nHere are some typography tips to consider:\n\nKeep it simple. Choose an easy-to-read font. Sans serif styles like Arial and Helvetica are perfect for infographics. Because they’re clear and versatile.\nMix fonts carefully. To include multiple fonts, choose two complementary ones. Use one font for headlines and another for body copy.\nSize matters. Pick a font size that is readable from a distance or on mobile devices. A recommended minimum font size is 16px.\nLimit text length. Keep the text concise and easy to read. Limit lines to six to eight words. Too much text can overwhelm your audience.\n7. Test and Refine\n\nFinally, always test your infographic. Testing and refining your infographic ensures it effectively communicates the intended message and resonates with the target audience.\n\nHere are three ways to do that:\n\nInvite a small group from your target audience to review the infographic. Consider their feedback and make any changes if needed.\nTest the design on various devices and browsers. Ensure everything functions as expected before publishing.\nAfter your infographic goes live, track its performance. Track page views, shares, and other key metrics to see how it resonates with your audience.\n\nFurther reading: 7 Common Infographic Designs & Why We Use Them\n\n4 Ways Infographics Transform Content Marketing Campaigns\nEnhancing Engagement\n\nInfographics have the ability to draw the attention of readers, far more than plain text or even standard images.\n\nWith a combination of relevant imagery, concise text, and organized data, they offer a quick snapshot of a topic.
