  "content": "What Is Ecommerce?\n\nEcommerce (short for electronic commerce) refers to selling products or services online. Meaning customers use websites or apps to make purchases rather than coming to physical locations.\n\nSome companies are solely ecommerce ventures. While others operate both online and in person—like Crumbl Cookies.\n\nIf you’re thinking about starting an ecommerce business, it's crucial to understand how it works in practice.\n\nHow Does Ecommerce Work?\n\nHere's an overview of how a typical ecommerce transaction between sellers and buyers unfolds:\n\nThe seller lists their products or services on their website, mobile app, or a third-party marketplace (sometimes a combination). They’ll likely also use various digital marketing tactics to increase their visibility.\nPotential customers find the products or services through online searches, social media, advertisements, and other marketing channels the seller uses. Or by directly visiting the online destination(s) where they’re sold. \nWhen customers are ready to buy, they add items to their virtual shopping carts \nAt checkout, customers provide payment information (credit card, digital wallet, or other another type of online payment method)\nThe payment is processed securely through an online payment gateway\nFor physical products, the order is fulfilled and shipped. For services or digital goods, access or delivery is provided electronically.\nAfter the customer receives their order, they may have the opportunity to provide feedback and rate their experience. Or initiate a return if necessary.\nAdvantages of Ecommerce\n\nRunning an ecommerce business has many perks:\n\nGlobal reach: Ecommerce allows you to offer your products or services to customers worldwide. Meaning your potential customer base is quite large.\nConvenience: Customers can engage with your business at any time, from anywhere, and without being limited by physical locations or business hours\nLow operating costs: Many ecommerce businesses enjoy lower operating costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar operations. Because they don’t have to account for expenses like rent, utilities, etc.\nOnline purchase popularity: Global ecommerce transactions are expected to surpass $8 trillion by 2027, according to Statista. Which means you have ample opportunities for selling online.\nMore data: Ecommerce businesses typically have more opportunities for easily collecting and storing information about prospects and customers. Which can be used for personalized marketing and customer retention. \n\nTip\n\nSemrush offers a suite of marketing tools to help you get started with digital marketing.

Which means both established players and new entrants are competing for the same market that may or may not be growing quickly.\nShipping and logistics: If you sell physical products, managing inventory, fulfilling orders, and handling returns can be complex\nHigh customer expectations: Customers expect fast shipping, easy returns, and responsive customer service. And it can be challenging to maintain those consistently.\nLimited face-to-face interaction: Ecommerce often lacks the personal touch of in-store shopping, which some customers may prefer\nData security: Customers provide financial information and personal details during online transactions. So, ecommerce businesses need to take extra precautions to ensure data is protected.\nTypes of Ecommerce Businesses Models\n\nIn ecommerce, there are several business models you can adopt.\n\nHere are the main ones:\n\nBusiness to Business\n\nThe business-to-business (B2B) model is when businesses sell products or services to other businesses. And the sales cycle is typically rather long—it can take weeks or even months to close a deal. \n\nThe CRM software company Salesforce is a prime example of a B2B ecommerce company. They offer cloud-based customer relationship management solutions to businesses of all sizes.\n\nBusiness to Consumer\n\nThe business-to-consumer (B2C) model is when businesses sell products or services directly to individual consumers. Rather than to other businesses.\n\nAnd this is the most common form of ecommerce.\n\nAmazon is a great example in this category. They offer a vast array of products directly to consumers through their online marketplace.\n\nBusiness to Government\n\nThe business-to-government (B2G) model involves businesses selling products or services to government entities. Such as agencies and departments at the federal, state, and local levels.\n\nThis may include supplying equipment, services, or technology.\n\nFor example, Microsoft provides a version of its software to various government agencies to improve their efficiency and security.\n\nConsumer to Consumer\n\nIn the consumer-to-consumer (C2C) model, individuals sell products or services to other individuals. Often by becoming sellers on online marketplaces.\n\neBay is a prime example of C2C ecommerce that makes it easy for individual buyers and sellers to connect.\n\nConsumer to Business\n\nThe consumer-to-business (C2B) model is when individuals offer products or services to businesses. This reverses the traditional B2C relationship, allowing individuals to create value for companies.\n\nFiverr is a great example of this. This platform connects businesses with freelancers who provide a wide range of services—from graphic design to writing and programming.\n\nEcommerce Revenue Models\n\nEcommerce businesses can use one or more of the following revenue models:\n\nDirect sales: This is when revenue is generated from selling your own products and services. For example, an online electronics retailer and a business consultant both follow this model.\nSubscription: You offer access to your products or services through a recurring fee (often monthly). Many also operate on a freemium model that offers a basic version for free but charges a premium for a more advanced one. Like Spotify.\nAffiliate marketing: You promote other companies' products or services and earn a commission based on the results you drive through your unique referral links. Commissions are often based on sales, but it depends on the relationship.\nMarketplace: You join a platform to sell through, and the platform provider earns a commission based on the sale. Amazon's third-party seller program is a prime example.\nHow to Start an Ecommerce Business\n\nLaunching an ecommerce business isn’t the same for everyone. Because it depends on your business model, the revenue model(s) you choose, and more. \n\nAs an example, let’s say you’re going to run a B2C ecommerce store and sell cosmetics directly on your own website.\n\nThe first step is to learn about your market and customers, so you can make informed decisions. This is called doing market research.\n\nUse Semrush’s Market Explorer tool for this. \n\nOpen the tool and click “Analyze Category.” Then, select your location, choose your business category, and click “Research a market.”\n\nYou’ll see key information about your chosen industry. Like key players and their positions in the market. Plus the overall market size. \n\nNote\n\nThis is also a good time to verify that your business can be successful. If the market size seems small or is dominated by just one or two companies, you may want to consider other options.\n\nScroll down to the “Domain vs. Market Dynamics” section and click on the different competitors. To see information about how much traffic their websites get and where that traffic comes from.\n\nThis information can give you ideas about marketing activities you may want to try.\n\nNext, click the “Audience” tab to learn about your audience’s age, gender, socioeconomic status, etc. Which can help you make decisions related to targeting, pricing, and more. \n\nIf you scroll down further, you’ll also see your audience’s top interests and preferred social media platforms. \n\nThese insights can further guide your ecommerce marketing strategy. Because you’ll know where your potential customers are spending their time online. \n\nOnce you’ve analyzed this market data, you can start developing your website. Which you can build yourself using platforms like Shopify or Wix. Or with the help of a developer.\n\nOnce your digital storefront is set up, you'll add your products, upload product images, write detailed descriptions, and set prices. To help customers make informed decisions.\n\nNext, you'll need to set up payment processing. Popular options include PayPal, Stripe, and Square. And make sure to offer multiple payment methods to cater to different customer preferences.\n\nAfter that, it’s time to establish your shipping and fulfillment process. Which includes deciding on shipping carriers, setting shipping rates, and determining how you'll handle order fulfillment. \n\nYou might choose to handle order fulfillment in house or partner with a third-party logistics provider like ShipMonk or ShipBob.\n\nFinally, your store is ready to launch. And that means you can push your site live and start promoting your products.\n\nLaunch Your Ecommerce Business Today\n\nIf you have a solid ecommerce business idea, now is the time to turn it into reality.\n\nSemrush has all the tools you need to succeed.\n\nSign up to get started today.\n\nStart Your Ecommerce Journey Today\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
