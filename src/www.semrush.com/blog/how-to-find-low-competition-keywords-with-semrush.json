  "content": "Finding a low-competition keyword is like finding a juicy peach in a grocery store. \n\nMost of the peaches look great until you sink your teeth into a tough one. \n\nKeywords are the same. \n\nUnfortunately, heavy keyword competition makes a lot of keywords really hard to rank for with SEO. \n\nBut, when you learn how to look closer and spot the difference between the hard ones and the juicy ones, you can start finding easy low-competition keywords to go after with your SEO plan.\n\nWhat Are Low-Competition Keywords? \n\nLow-competition keywords are search queries that have fewer companies and websites overtly competing for high organic rankings with SEO.\n\nBecause they have less competition, these keywords are good opportunities for an SEO plan.\n\nTargeting low-competition keywords with helpful content on your website can help you achieve your organic traffic goals with less off-page strategy or social promotion. \n\nFinding the Low-Hanging Fruit in SEO \n\nIn terms of SEO, low-hanging fruits are high search volume low-competition keywords. \n\nSearches in the sweet spot of being not popular enough to be overly crowded with competitors, but still common enough to send your website traffic.\n\nThis sweet spot is where you find your best opportunities to start getting organic search traffic to your site.\n\nIf you’re entering a new market or starting a new website, you’re going to want to find as much low-hanging fruit for your SEO strategy as possible.\n\nTake it from Alizée Baudez, SEO consultant and digital marketing specialist: \n\nWith the Keyword Magic Tool, I like to start by filtering out KD% that are too high. That way, I know my client won’t focus on unreachable keywords...This is a simple way to go grab low-hanging fruits and make sure the content plan that we'll follow will actually be useful to customers.\n\nAlizée Baudez, SEO Consultant & Digital Marketing Specialist\n\nHow to Find Low-Competition Keywords with High Traffic \n\nYou can quickly find long-tail keywords and specific questions people search for online by looking at our metrics like keyword difficulty, competitive density, and volume. \n\nIn just three easy steps on Semrush, you can build a juicy list of keywords with high volume and low competition—even if you’ve never tried it before:\n\nBuild your initial keyword list\nExpand your keyword list\nFilter for high-volume keywords with less competition\nStep 1. Build Your Initial Keyword List (How to Research Competitors’ Keywords)\n\nStart with: Organic Research Positions. \n\nHere you have to:\n\nGo to Semrush Organic Research\nEnter a competitor’s domain name and click Search \n\nYou will get a list of keywords your competitor’s website is ranking for in Google’s top 100 organic search results.\n\nWe’ll use the healthy cooking niche as an example so a competitor would be eatingwell.com.\n\nNow, you can dig through their performance and see the keywords where they’re getting traffic from search engines.\n\nTake note of the KD% (keyword difficulty) column. This is our way of measuring the difficulty of competing for this keyword if you’re starting from scratch. \n\nWe’ll talk more about KD% below in this post.\n\nYou can also use filters to find more specific search terms that are more relevant to your business. For example, here’s how it looks with a filter to find keywords that include “vegan.” \n\nYou can combine filters for KD%, volume, or even number of words per phrase (for example, keywords containing 4 words or more) to find low competition, long-tail keywords that you can add to your list.\n\nRepeat this process for multiple competitors and send the keywords you like into the Keyword Strategy Builder where you can save a master list of up to 1000 keywords.\n\nPictured above is an example of an Organic Positions report getting filtered by KD% and then sending the top 100 keywords to a new list in Keyword Strategy Builder.\n\nNext tool to use: Keyword Gap\n\nGo to the Keyword Gap tool to compare keywords between domains to find more long-tail queries \nEnter your site and up to four of your competitors into the input fields and hit the compare button\n\nFor example, we took the following three domains: eatingwell.com, verywellfit.com, and health.com.\n\nIn a few clicks, we built a list of over six million keywords for the healthy cooking niche.\n\nTip\n\nIf you don’t know which domains are in your website’s industry, use the Competitors report tab in Organic Research.\n\nUse the missing, weak, and untapped filters to find the best opportunities for your site. \n\nNow export the keywords you like from this report to the Keyword Strategy Builder to combine the list with your other exports so you can keep a master list going. \n\nThe next step will help you find even more keyword ideas to add here.\n\nStep 2. Find More High Search Volume Low-Competition Keywords\n\nTool to use: Keyword Magic Tool\n\nNow it's time to expand your low competition high volume keyword list with more phrases you might have overlooked. \n\nTo find phrase match keywords, \n\nGo to the Keyword Magic Tool\nEnter a term from your initial list of search terms, and click Search \n\nYou will get a list of expanded keyword phrases that include your queried term.\n\nNext, use the Related filter to find related keywords. \n\nThis will list phrases that are semantically related to a particular queried search term and may not share the same phrasing but have similar search results. You’ll want to add some of these to your plan as well to cover your bases.\n\nTo find question keywords (which make for great content topics) use the Questions filter. This will display only keyword phrases that include who, what, where, when, why, or how.\n\nIf we’re looking at this list of keywords in the image above—KD% is still pretty high. So if you see KD scores like this you’ll want to add a filter for lower difficulty. More on this in step 3.\n\nAgain, send your desired keywords to the list in Keyword Strategy Builder with all the other keywords you’d like to target.\n\nTip\n\nUse the SERP Gap Analyzer app in the Semrush App Center to find specific keyword opportunities for your site.\n \n\nThis app scans Google SERPs related to your seed topic to find weaknesses in high-ranking pages and easy-to-rank-for terms.\n \n\nTo use it for topic suggestions, click the “Suggested Seed Topics” tab. \n \n\nOnce you enter your website and click “Suggest,” the app will recommend topics to consider. To run an analysis on any of the recommended terms, simply click that topic. \n \n\nStep 3. Filter for High-Volume Keywords With Less Competition\n\nThe average monthly search volume for each keyword shows you how much potential traffic you can receive. The higher your rankings for high-volume search terms are, the more traffic will be driven to your website. \n\nYet, competition for the most popular keywords is very high. There’s no sense in trying to rank for keywords you have no chance of ranking for. You need to find that balance between a keyword’s search volume and its competition level.\n\nTo help you with this step, Semrush has two main ways of filtering to find low competition keywords:\n\nKeyword Difficulty (SEO)—an estimation of how difficult it would be to organically outrank the current websites and webpages ranking in the top spots on Google for a particular keyword.\nCompetition Level (PPC)—the density of paid advertisers using a particular search phrase for their ads. Although this metric refers to competition in paid search, it can be somewhat representative of organic search competition as well.\n\nIn the Keyword Strategy Builder, you should be able to locate the column for each metric. Both metrics will help you look closer to find the best keywords to start targeting to find success.\n\nEstimating Keyword Difficulty\n\nKeyword difficulty (from 1-100%) shows you an estimate of how difficult it would be to seize your competitors’ positions in the Google top 100 with a particular keyword. \n\nThe higher the percentage, the more effort you’ll need to outrank your competition for targeted keywords:\n\nAbove 69%: The most difficult keywords. You’ll have to invest a lot of SEO and link-building efforts, as well as time before you’ll be able to enter the Google top 20. If you have a new site, focusing on highly competitive keywords might not be a reasonable idea.\nFrom 50-69%: Keywords with average difficulty. Entering the Google top 20 with these keywords won't be easy either. However, with high-quality content and relevant backlinks, you might be able to seize your competitors’ positions in time.\nFrom 30-49%: Keywords that are possible to rank for when you’re starting out. \nBelow 30%: Keywords that are the very easiest to rank for, likely with low search volume or highly specific search intent.\n\nDiscovering low-competition, high-volume keywords will require hard work and patience. But if you are lucky enough to find a strong list of these search terms and implement them throughout your site, you’ll have a very good chance of ranking high for these high-volume search terms.\n\nEstimating Competition Level\n\nFor estimating Competition Level, we can assume the scale is roughly the same. The main difference here is that the metric is a decimal between 0 and 1 and that it measures the density of paid advertisers. \n\nThe closer the score is to 1, the higher the number of advertisers currently bidding on this keyword. Therefore, the harder it would be to stand out in the search results.\n\nAbove 0.80: These keywords are highly competitive among advertisers and therefore likely send traffic to paid results. You could infer that if a keyword has a high density of advertisers, the search has some intent on making a transaction. \nFrom 0.60-0.80: Keywords with an average density of advertisers. You could experiment with advertising on these keywords if your organic efforts don’t work out, but it won’t be a quick win on any of these keywords, either.\nBelow 0.60: Keywords with the lowest density of advertisers. This could either mean that they are under the radar of most competitors that advertise in your niche, or they are simply not profitable to advertise on. Keep this in mind when dedicating.\n\nAgain, you can refer to the suggested ranges above but the best opportunities to start with are keywords with KD% less than 50. Start looking for those keywords in the 40s, 30s, or below that are relevant to you, and then build up from there. \n\nThink About Search Intent \n\nHowever, just because a keyword has low competition and high volume doesn’t mean it’s right for your target audience. \n\nA quick reminder: there are four main forms of search intent. They include: \n\ninformational \nnavigational \ntransactional \ncommercial\n\nSo, let’s say you find a keyword that has loads of volume and has no competition. \n\nGreat, right? \n\nWell, no. If that keyword is a navigational search query for another brand, those searchers aren't looking for your site. \n\nBut, if you find a high-volume search query inquiring about a service you sell that has low competition, that would be a good keyword to add to your list. \n\nIt’s worth remembering that search intent also has a role in who you’re trying to attract. \n\nFactor in CPC\n\nWhat if a term is low competition, but doesn’t have high volume? Since a lot of high-volume keywords are already being targeted by a lot of companies online, most low-competition keywords will have relatively low volume. This is okay!\n\nIf you take a look at the CPC, it could indicate something about this keyword’s value. \n\nCost-per-click is the amount an advertiser pays for a click on their ad depending on the keyword (decided upon before). It’s a term for paid ads, but you can use it with low competition to find searchers ready to buy. \n\nMaybe a term is highly relevant to your site but only has a search volume of 20. If the intent is right, the competition is low, and it has a high CPC, it’s a search term you might want to consider. \n\nUse Your Resources \n\nGoogle tweeted in 2022 that 15% of Google searches have never been searched for before. \n\nHow can you capitalize on these keywords that have 0 search volume? \n\nFind where your target audience frequents. Visit groups on social media, forums, and sites like YouTube to see what your target audience is talking about. \n\nWhat problems do they have? How do they phrase what they’re looking for? \n\nYou can use sources like these to find keywords that are completely untapped because they haven’t been searched yet but will be soon. \n\nMeasure Difficulty With the Keyword Overview Report\n\nYou can quickly estimate keyword competition in bulk with the Semrush Keyword Overview. Just enter a list of up to 100 keywords from this tool’s main page.\n\nPerhaps you have a list of keyword targets or a list of keywords your site already ranks for exported from Google Search Console. You can drop that list in here and quickly see how we rate the difficulty of each keyword. \n\nFrom the Keyword Overview homepage, you can view the keyword difficulty of up to 100 keywords at once. Enter one search term per line, choose your regional database, and click the Analyze button. \n\nThe report will give you the KD scores, along with other metrics like volume and CPC, of your unique batch of keywords. \n\nBonus: Spot Low-Competition Keywords for SERP Features\n\nA low-difficulty keyword that has a Featured Snippet on the SERP would be a great opportunity because you could:\n\nTake up more real estate at the top of the SERP\nGive your audience information faster and look trustworthy to them\nTheoretically acquire this more easily than a high-difficulty keyword\n\nFor tips on acquiring a Featured Snippet, check out How to Target and Win SERP Features.\n\nWhile you’re in the Bulk Keyword Analysis, you can also see which keywords trigger SERP Features like Featured Snippets or Instant Answers. \n\nRecap and More Resources\n\nLearning how to do keyword research is essential for businesses.
