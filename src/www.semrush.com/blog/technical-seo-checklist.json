  "content": "Technical SEO is primarily about making it easier for search engines to find, index, and rank your website. It can also enhance your site’s user experience (UX) by making it faster and more accessible.\n\nWe’ve put together a comprehensive technical SEO checklist to help you address and prevent potential technical issues. And provide the best experience for your users.\n\nTip\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along with the steps in this checklist.\n\nCrawlability and Indexability \n\nSearch engines like Google use crawlers to discover (crawl) content. And add it to their database of webpages (known as the index).\n\nIf your site has indexing or crawling errors, your pages might not appear in search results. Leading to reduced visibility and traffic.\n\nHere are the most important crawlability and indexability issues to check for:\n\n1. Redirect or Replace Broken Internal Links\n\nBroken internal links point to non-existent pages within your site. This can happen if you’ve mistyped the URL, deleted the page, or moved it without setting up a proper redirect.\n\nClicking on a broken link normally takes you to a 404 error page:\n\nBroken links disrupt the user's experience on your site. And make it harder for people to find what they need.\n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to identify broken links. \n\nOpen the tool and follow the configuration guide to set it up. (Or stick with the default settings.) Then, click “Start Site Audit.” \n\nOnce your report is ready, you’ll see an overview page.\n\nClick on “View details” in the “Internal Linking” widget under “Thematic Reports.” This will take you to a dedicated report on your site’s internal linking structure.\n\nYou can find any broken link issues under the “Errors” section. Click on the “# Issues” button on the “Broken internal links” line for a complete list of all your broken links.\n\nTo fix the issues, first go through the links on the list one by one and check that they’re spelled correctly. \n\nIf they’re correct but still broken, replace them with links that point to relevant live pages. Or remove them entirely. \n\nFind and Fix Broken Links\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n2. Fix 5XX Errors\n\n5XX errors (like 500 HTTP status codes) happen when your web server encounters an issue that prevents it from fulfilling a user or crawler request. Making the page inaccessible. \n\nLike not being able to load a webpage because the server is overloaded with too many requests.\n\nServer-side errors prevent users and crawlers from accessing your webpages. This negatively impacts both user experience and crawlability. Which can lead to a drop in organic (free) traffic to your website.\n\nJump back into the Site Audit tool to check for any 5XX errors. \n\nNavigate to the “Issues” tab. Then, search for “5XX” in the search bar. \n\nIf Site Audit identifies any issues, you’ll see a “# pages returned a 5XX status code” error. Click on the link for a complete list of affected pages. Either fix these issues yourself or send the list to your developer to investigate and resolve the issues.\n\n3. Fix Redirect Chains and Loops\n\nA redirect sends users and crawlers to a different page than the one they originally tried to access. It’s a great way to ensure visitors don’t land on a broken page. \n\nBut if a link redirects to another redirect, it can create a chain. Like this:\n\nLong redirect chains can slow down your site and waste crawl budget.\n\nRedirect loops, on the other hand, happen when a chain loops in on itself. For example, if page X redirects to page Y, and page Y redirects back to page X. \n\nRedirect loops make it difficult for search engines to crawl your site and can trap both crawlers and users in an endless cycle. Preventing them from accessing your content. \n\nUse Site Audit to identify redirect chains and loops. \n\nJust open the “Issues” tab. And search for “redirect chain” in the search bar.\n\nAddress redirect chains by linking directly to the destination page.\n\nFor redirect loops, find and fix the faulty redirects so each one points to the correct final page.\n\n4. Use an XML Sitemap\n\nAn XML sitemap lists all the important pages on your website. Helping search engines like Google discover and index your content more easily.\n\nYour sitemap might look something like this:\n\nWithout an XML sitemap, search engine bots need to rely on links to navigate your site and discover your important pages. Which can lead to some pages being missed. \n\nEspecially if your site is large or complex to navigate.\n\nIf you use a content management system (CMS) like WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or Shopify, it may generate a sitemap file for you automatically.\n\nYou can typically access it by typing yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml in your browser. (Sometimes, it’ll be yourdomain.com/sitemap_index.xml instead.)\n\nLike this:\n\nIf your CMS or website builder doesn’t generate an XML sitemap for you, you can use a sitemap generator tool.\n\nFor example, if you have a smaller site, you can use XML-Sitemaps.com. Just enter your site URL and click “Start.”\n\nOnce you have your sitemap, save the file as “sitemap.xml” and upload it to your site’s root directory or public_html folder.\n\nNote\n\nReach out to your web host for instructions specific to their platform.\n\nFinally, submit your sitemap to Google through your Google Search Console account. \n\nTo do that, open your account and click “Sitemaps” in the left-hand menu.\n\nEnter your sitemap URL. And click “Submit.”\n\nUse Site Audit to make sure your sitemap is set up correctly. Just search for “Sitemap” on the “Issues” tab.\n\n5. Set Up Your Robots.txt File\n\nA robots.txt file is a set of instructions that tells search engines like Google which pages they should and shouldn’t crawl. \n\nThis helps focus crawlers on your most valuable content, keeping them from wasting resources on unimportant pages. Or pages you don’t want to appear in search results, like login pages.\n\nNote\n\nYour robots.txt file won’t prevent pages from ever being found (by search engines or users). You should use methods like password protection to block sensitive pages.\n\nIf you don’t set up your robots.txt file correctly, you could risk blocking important pages from appearing in search results. Harming your organic visibility. \n\nIf your site doesn’t have a robots.txt file yet, use a robots.txt generator tool to create one. If you’re using a CMS like WordPress, there are plugins that can do this for you.\n\nAdd your sitemap URL to your robots.txt file to help search engines understand which pages are most important on your site. \n\nIt might look something like this:\n\nSitemap: https://www.yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /admin/\nDisallow: /private/\n\nIn this example, we’re disallowing all web crawlers from crawling our /admin/ and /private/ pages. \n\nUse Google Search Console to check the status of your robots.txt files.\n\nOpen your account, and head over to “Settings.”\n\nThen, find \"robots.txt\" under \"Crawling.\" And click \"OPEN REPORT\" to view the details.\n\nYour report includes robots.txt files from your domain and subdomains. If there are any issues, you’ll see the number of problems in the “Issues” column. \n\nClick on any row to access the file and see where any issues might be. From here, you or your developer can use a robots.txt validator to fix the problems.\n\nFurther reading: What Robots.txt Is & Why It Matters for SEO \n\n6. Make Sure Important Pages Are Indexed \n\nIf your pages don’t appear in Google’s index, Google can’t rank them for relevant search queries and show them to users. \n\nAnd no rankings means no search traffic.\n\nUse Google Search Console to find out which pages aren’t indexed and why.\n\nClick “Pages” from the left-hand menu, under “Indexing.”\n\nThen scroll down to the “Why pages aren’t indexed” section. To see a list of reasons that Google hasn’t indexed your pages. Along with the number of affected pages. \n\nClick one of the reasons to see a full list of pages with that issue.\n\nOnce you fix the issue, you can request indexing to prompt Google to recrawl your page (although this doesn’t guarantee the page will be indexed).\n\nJust click the URL. Then select “INSPECT URL” on the right-hand side.\n\nThen, click the “REQUEST INDEXING” button from the page’s URL inspection report.\n\nWebsite Structure\n\nSite structure, or website architecture, is the way your website’s pages are organized and linked together.\n\nA well-structured site provides a logical and efficient navigation system for users and search engines. This can:\n\nHelp search engines find and index all your site’s pages\nSpread authority throughout your webpages via internal links\nMake it easy for users to find the content they’re looking for\n\nHere’s how to ensure you have a logical and SEO-friendly site structure: \n\n7. Check Your Site Structure Is Organized\n\nAn organized site structure has a clear, hierarchical layout. With main categories and subcategories that logically group related pages together.\n\nFor example, an online bookstore might have main categories like \"Fiction,\" \"Non-Fiction,\" and \"Children's Books.” With subcategories like \"Mystery,\" \"Biographies,\" and \"Picture Books\" under each main category.\n\nThis way, users can quickly find what they’re looking for.\n\nHere’s how Barnes & Noble’s site structure looks like in action, from users’ point of view: \n\nIn this example, Barnes & Noble’s fiction books are organized by subjects. Which makes it easier for visitors to navigate the retailer’s collection more easily. And to find what they need.\n\nIf you run a small site, optimizing your site structure may just be a case of organizing your pages and posts into categories. And having a clean, simple navigation menu.\n\nIf you have a large or complex website, you can get a quick overview of your site architecture by navigating to the “Crawled Pages” tab of your Site Audit report. And clicking “Site Structure.”\n\nReview your site’s subfolders to make sure the hierarchy is well-organized.\n\n8. Optimize Your URL Structure \n\nA well-optimized URL structure makes it easier for Google to crawl and index your site. It can also make navigating your site more user-friendly. \n\nHere’s how to enhance your URL structure:\n\nBe descriptive. This helps search engines (and users) understand your page content. So use keywords that describe the page’s content. Like “example.com/seo-tips” instead of “example.com/page-671.”\nKeep it short. Short, clean URL structures are easier for users to read and share. Aim for concise URLs. Like “example.com/about” instead of “example.com/how-our-company-started-our-journey-page-update.”\nReflect your site hierarchy. This helps maintain a predictable and logical site structure. Which makes it easier for users to know where they are on your site. For example, if you have a blog section on your website, you could nest individual blog posts under the blog category. Like this:\n\nFurther reading: What Is a URL? A Complete Guide to Website URLs\n\n9. Add Breadcrumbs\n\nBreadcrumbs are a type of navigational aid used to help users understand their location within your site's hierarchy. And to make it easy to navigate back to previous pages.\n\nThey also help search engines find their way around your site. And can improve crawlability.\n\nBreadcrumbs typically appear near the top of a webpage. And provide a trail of links from the current page back to the homepage or main categories.\n\nFor example, each of these is a breadcrumb:\n\nAdding breadcrumbs is generally more beneficial for larger sites with a deep (complex) site architecture. But you can set them up early, even for smaller sites, to enhance your navigation and SEO from the start.\n\nTo do this, you need to use breadcrumb schema in your page’s code. Check out this breadcrumb structured data guide from Google to learn how.\n\nAlternatively, if you use a CMS like WordPress, you can use dedicated plugins. Like Breadcrumb NavXT, which can easily add breadcrumbs to your site without needing to edit code.\n\nFurther reading: Breadcrumb Navigation for Websites: What It Is & How to Use It \n\n10. Minimize Your Click Depth\n\nIdeally, it should take fewer than four clicks to get from your homepage to any other page on your site. You should be able to reach your most important pages in one or two clicks.\n\nWhen users have to click through multiple pages to find what they’re looking for, it creates a bad experience. Because it makes your site feel complicated and frustrating to navigate.\n\nSearch engines like Google might also assume that deeply buried pages are less important. And might crawl them less frequently.\n\nThe “Internal Linking” report in Site Audit can quickly show you any pages that require four or more clicks to reach:\n\nOne of the easiest ways to reduce crawl depth is to make sure important pages are linked directly from your homepage or main category pages. \n\nFor example, if you run an ecommerce site, link popular product categories or best-selling products directly from the homepage. \n\nAlso ensure your pages are interlinked well. For example, if you have a blog post on “how to create a skincare routine,” you could link to it in another relevant post like “skincare routine essentials.”\n\nSee our guide to effective internal linking to learn more.\n\n11. Identify Orphan Pages\n\nOrphan pages are pages with zero incoming internal links. \n\nSearch engine crawlers use links to discover pages and navigate the web. So orphan pages may go unnoticed when search engine bots crawl your site. \n\nOrphan pages are also harder for users to discover. \n\nFind orphan pages by heading over to the “Issues” tab within Site Audit. And search for “orphaned pages.”\n\nFix the issue by adding a link to the orphaned page from another relevant page.\n\nFind and Fix Technical SEO Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nAccessibility and Usability\n\nUsability measures how easily and efficiently users can interact with and navigate your website to achieve their goals. Like making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter.\n\nAccessibility focuses on making all of a site’s functions available for all types of users. Regardless of their abilities, internet connection, browser, and device.\n\nSites with better usability and accessibility tend to offer a better page experience. Which Google’s ranking systems aim to reward.\n\nThis can contribute to better performance in search results, higher levels of engagement, lower bounce rates, and increased conversions.\n\nHere’s how to improve your site’s accessibility and usability:\n\n12. Make Sure You’re Using HTTPS\n\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a secure protocol used for sending data between a user's browser and the server of the website they're visiting.\n\nIt encrypts this data, making it far more secure than HTTP.\n\nYou can tell your site runs on a secure server by clicking the icon beside the URL. And looking for the “Connection is secure” option. Like this:\n\nAs a ranking signal, HTTPS is an essential item on any tech SEO checklist. You can implement it on your site by acquiring an SSL certificate. Many web hosting services offer this when you sign up, often for free. \n\nOnce you implement it, use Site Audit to check for any issues. Like having non-secure pages.\n\nJust click on “View details” under “HTTPS” from your Site Audit overview dashboard.\n\nIf your site has an HTTPS issue, you can click the issue to see a list of affected URLs and get advice on how to address the problem.\n\n13. Use Structured Data\n\nStructured data is information you add to your site to give search engines more context about your page and its contents. \n\nLike the average customer rating for your products. Or your business’s opening hours. \n\nOne of the most popular ways to mark up (or label) this data is by using schema markup. \n\nUsing schema helps Google interpret your content. And it may lead to Google showing rich snippets for your site in search results. Making your content stand out and potentially attract more traffic. \n\nFor example, recipe schema shows up on the SERP as ratings, number of reviews, sitelinks, cook time, and more. Like this:\n\nYou can use schema on various types of webpages and content, including:\n\nProduct pages\nLocal business listings\nEvent pages\nRecipe pages\nJob postings\nHow-to-guides\nVideo content\nMovie/book reviews\nBlog posts\n\nUse Google’s Rich Results Test tool to check if your page is eligible for rich results. Just insert the URL of the page you want to test and click “TEST URL.”\n\nFor example, the recipe site from the example above is eligible for “Recipes” structured data.\n\nIf there’s an issue with your existing structured data, you’ll see an error or a warning on the same line. Click on the structured data you’re analyzing to view the list of issues.\n\nCheck out our article on how to generate schema markup for a step-by-step guide on adding structured data to your site.\n\nNote\n\nSome content management systems, like Wix and WordPress, might not make it easy to edit your code directly. You might need to install a plugin or use a built-in feature instead.\n\n14. Use Hreflang for International Pages\n\nHreflang is a link attribute you add to your website's code to tell search engines about different language versions of your webpages.\n\nThis way, search engines can direct users to the version most relevant to their location and preferred language.\n\nHere’s an example of an hreflang tag on Airbnb’s site:\n\nNote that there are multiple versions of this URL for different languages and regions. Like “es-us” for Spanish speakers in the USA. And “de” for German speakers.\n\nIf you have multiple versions of your site in different languages or for different countries, using hreflang tags helps search engines serve the right version to the right audience. \n\nThis can improve your international SEO and boost your site's UX.\n\nNote\n\nUsing these tags can be confusing, and it’s easy to make mistakes. Check out our post on hreflang attributes for a step-by-step guide to implementing them correctly.\n\nSpeed and Performance\n\nPage speed is a ranking factor for both desktop and mobile searches. Which means optimizing your site for speed can increase its visibility. Potentially leading to more traffic. And even more conversions.\n\nHere’s how to improve your site’s speed and performance with technical SEO:\n\n15. Improve Your Core Web Vitals\n\nCore Web Vitals are a set of three performance metrics that measure how user-friendly your site is. Based on load speed, responsiveness, and visual stability.\n\nThe three metrics are:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint(LCP): Measures how quickly the largest content element of a page loads\nInteraction to Next Paint (INP): Measures how quickly a site responds to user interactions\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures how much a page’s layout shifts while it’s loading\n\nCore Web Vitals are also a ranking factor. So you should prioritize measuring and improving them as part of your technical SEO checklist.\n\nMeasure the Core Web Vitals of a single page using Google PageSpeed Insights.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your URL, and click “Analyze.”\n\nYou’ll see the results for both mobile and desktop:\n\nScroll down to the “Diagnostics” section under “Performance” for a list of things you can do to improve your Core Web Vitals and other performance metrics. \n\nWork through this list or send it to your developer to improve your site’s performance.\n\n16. Ensure Mobile-Friendliness \n\nMobile-friendly sites tend to perform better in search rankings. In fact, mobile-friendliness has been a ranking factor since 2015.\n\nPlus, Google primarily indexes the mobile version of your site, as opposed to the desktop version. This is called mobile-first indexing. Making mobile-friendliness even more important for ranking.\n\nHere are some key features of a mobile-friendly site:\n\nSimple, clear navigation \nFast loading times \nResponsive design that adjusts content to fit different screen sizes\nEasily readable text without zooming\nTouch-friendly buttons and links with enough space between them\nFewest number of steps necessary to complete a form or transaction\n17. Reduce the Size of Your Webpages\n\nA smaller page file size is one factor that can contribute to faster load times on your site. \n\nBecause the smaller the file size, the faster it can transfer from your server to the user's device.\n\nUse Site Audit to find out if your site has issues with large webpage sizes. \n\nFilter for “Site Performance” from your report’s “Issues” tab. \n\nReduce your page size by:\n\nMinifying your CSS and JavaScript files with tools like Minify\nReviewing your page’s HTML code and working with a developer to improve its structure and/or remove unnecessary inline scripts, spaces, and styles\nEnabling caching to store static versions of your webpages on browsers or servers, speeding up subsequent visits\n18. Optimize Your Images\n\nOptimized images load faster because they have smaller file sizes. Which means less data for the user’s device to download. \n\nThis reduces the time it takes for the images to appear on the screen, resulting in faster page load times and a better user experience.\n\nHere are some tips to get you started:\n\nCompress your images. Use software like TinyPNG to easily shrink your images without losing quality.\nUse a Content Delivery Network (CDN). CDNs help speed up image delivery by caching (or storing) images on servers closer to the user's location. So when a user’s device requests to load an image, the server that’s closest to their geographical location will deliver it.\nUse the right image formats. Some formats are better for web use because they are smaller and load faster. For example, WebP is up to three times smaller than JPEG and PNG.\nUse responsive image scaling. This means the images will automatically adjust to fit the user’s screen size. So graphics won’t be larger than they need to be, slowing down the site. Some CMSs (like Wix) do this by default. \n\nHere’s an example of responsive design in action:\n\nFurther reading: Image SEO: How to Optimize Images for Search Engines & Users\n\n19. Remove Unnecessary Third-Party Scripts\n\nThird-party scripts are pieces of code from outside sources or third-party vendors. Like social media buttons, analytics tracking codes, and advertising scripts.\n\nYou can embed these snippets of code into your site to make it dynamic and interactive. Or to give it additional capabilities.\n\nBut third-party scripts can also slow down your site and hinder performance. \n\nUse PageSpeed Insights to check for third-party script issues of a single page. This can be helpful for smaller sites with fewer pages.\n\nBut since third-party scripts tend to run across many (or all) pages on your site, identifying issues on just one or two pages can give you insights into broader site-wide problems. Even for larger sites.\n\nNote\n\nMake sure to only remove the third-party scripts you no longer use. Rather than removing important ones in pursuit of a performance score improvement. \n\nContent\n\nTechnical content issues can impact how search engines index and rank your pages. They can also hurt your UX.\n\nHere’s how to fix common technical issues with your content:\n\n20. Address Duplicate Content Issues\n\nDuplicate content is content that’s identical or highly similar to content that exists elsewhere on the internet. Whether on another website or your own. \n\nDuplicate content can hurt your site’s credibility and make it harder for Google to index and rank your content for relevant search terms. \n\nUse Site Audit to quickly find out if you have duplicate content issues.\n\nJust search for “Duplicate” under the “Issues” tab. Click on the “# pages” link next to the “pages have duplicate content issues” error for a full list of affected URLs.\n\nAddress duplicate content issues by implementing:\n\nCanonical tags to identify the primary version of your content\n301 redirects to ensure users and search engines end up on the right version of your page\n\nFind and Fix Duplicate Content Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n21. Fix Thin Content Issues\n\nThin content offers little to no value to site visitors. It doesn’t meet search intent or address any of the reader’s problems. \n\nThis kind of content provides a poor user experience. Which can result in higher bounce rates, unsatisfied users, and even penalties from Google. \n\nTo identify thin content on your site, look for pages that are:\n\nPoorly written and don’t deliver a valuable message\nCopied from other sites \nFilled with ads or spammy links\nAuto-generated using AI or a programmatic method \n\nThen, redirect or remove it, combine the content with another similar page, or turn it into another content format. Like infographics or a social media post.\n\n22. Check Your Pages Have Metadata\n\nMetadata is information about a webpage that helps search engines understand its content. So it can better match and display the content to relevant search queries. \n\nIt includes elements like the title tag and meta description, which summarize the page’s content and purpose.\n\n(Technically, the title tag isn’t a meta tag from an HTML perspective. But it’s important for your SEO and worth discussing alongside other metadata.)\n\nUse Site Audit to easily check for issues like missing meta descriptions or title tags. Across your entire site.\n\nJust filter your results for “Meta tags” under the issues tab. Click the linked number next to an issue for a full list of pages with that problem.\n\nThen, go through and fix each issue. To improve your visibility (and appearance) in search results.\n\nPut This Technical SEO Checklist Into Action Today\n\nNow that you know what to look for in your technical SEO audit, it’s time to execute on it. \n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to identify over 140 SEO issues.
