The better the prompt, the better the response.\n\nHere’s how to create prompts for ChatGPT that help get you the most useful answers: \n\n1. Provide Contextual Details\n\nContext helps ChatGPT understand your specific situation and requirements better. So it can narrow down the information and give you more tailored responses. \n\nFor example, with a general prompt like, “write a sales pitch,” you get the following:\n\nThe result is a generic pitch that isn’t tailored to your brand, tone of voice, product, or target audience. \n\nLet’s add some context by specifying the product and audience.\n\nNow, the messaging is more likely to connect with your audience and encourage them to take action—in this case, to buy your product.\n\nSimilarly, saying, “discuss popular social media platforms” returns random, general information about every social media platform:\n\nWith more direction, ChatGPT can focus on exactly what you need and want. Like comparing the features and target audiences of specific social media platforms.\n\n2. Feed It Content or Reference Material\n\nRight now, ChatGPT can’t fully browse the internet, although it can search using Microsoft’s Bing web browser.\n\nSo if you want to get the most accurate and up-to-date responses, you need to provide additional content for reference.\n\nYou might do this when you need:\n\nDomain-specific knowledge: If you want responses tailored to a particular domain, company, or industry, include content to help ChatGPT learn the terminology or best practices\nConsistent style and tone: Share content that will help ChatGPT emulate your brand or writing tone\nFact-checking and accuracy: Supply ChatGPT with verified information or resources to help it produce more reliable responses\n\nLet’s say you want ChatGPT to write a meta description for an existing article.\n\nTo get the best results, briefly summarize the article's main points and specify any keywords you want included. You could even send some examples of meta descriptions you like as inspiration.\n\nLike this:\n\nPro tip\n\nDon’t feed ChatGPT any sensitive personal or company information you don’t want available to anyone else. OpenAI stores queries, which the provider (and potentially its partners and contractors) can see.\n \n\nAnd according to OpenAI, “Your conversations may be reviewed by our AI trainers to improve our systems.”\n \n\nPlus, as more and more data gets stored online, the risk of it getting hacked grows. \n\n3. Be Specific\n\nClearly defined instructions help focus ChatGPT’s response. And avoids deviations or ambiguous outputs.\n\nLet’s say you’re looking for marketing advice on how to grow your small business’s online presence.\n\nA prompt like “talk about marketing strategies” is too broad and will likely give you vague advice.\n\nLike this:\n\nInstead, tailor your prompt to your specific requirements. For example, ask, “explain three effective digital marketing strategies for small businesses.”\n\nThis way, you’re more likely to receive a helpful answer. \n\nLike this:\n\n4. Set Parameters\n\nSpecifying constraints in your prompt saves you time and lots of back and forth by forcing ChatGPT to target its responses.\n\nFor example, you can ask ChatGPT to give you a certain number of words, characters, sentences, or even outputs.\n\nLet’s say you’re asking ChatGPT for help with writing headlines. You can ask it for a specific number of options:\n\nAlternatively, guide ChatGPT to adopt a specific viewpoint or consider a particular methodology while generating the response.\n\n5. Specify a Format\n\nProviding the output format in a ChatGPT response helps guide the AI model to generate the content type you’re looking for.\n\nIf you have a particular format you want, like a short story or meta description, state it explicitly. \n\nYou can also ask the ChatGPT to list pros and cons, provide step-by-step instructions, or respond in any other format structure you want. \n\nDo you want the response in bullet point form or as a paragraph—or both?\n\nThe more specific, the better.\n\n6. Tell ChatGPT to Act As a Specific Role\n\nAssigning a specific role to ChatGPT—called “role specification”—gives it a clear context and persona. \n\nThis way, it can tap into the knowledge and communication style associated with that role. And align its responses with the expertise and perspective you need for your task.\n\nFor example, the prompt “Give me suggestions on improving my link-building efforts” will generate a generic response.\n\nLike this:\n\nBut asking, \"As an experienced and professional SEO strategist, give me suggestions on how to improve my link-building efforts” yields more comprehensive, high-quality results. \n\nLike this:\n\nDepending on your industry, you can ask ChatGPT to act like an industry expert or even a system. Like an Excel sheet or a data analytics platform. \n\n7. Refine the Prompts\n\nWhen ChatGPT doesn’t respond how you want, you can edit your original prompt. Or re-prompt it using different wording to get better results.\n\nLet’s say you’ve asked ChatGPT to give you three reasons why companies should invest in SEO. But ChatGPT’s response is too formal:\n\nOne way to refine your prompt is by hovering over it and clicking the pencil icon.\n\nThen, update your prompt and click “Save.” \n\nChatGPT will produce a new response. Like this:\n\nAlternatively, you can write a new prompt with more specific instructions.\n\nPro tip\n\nAI models like ChatGPT can sometimes veer off topic, repeat previously generated responses, or even hallucinate (make things up.) In this case, start a new prompt (or even a brand new chat) to refocus the tool and get back on track.\n\nSpeed Up Your Workflow with ChatGPT Prompts \n\nOnce you know how to write ChatGPT prompts, you’ll be able to achieve more accurate outputs more quickly.\n\nThese prompts are meant to inspire you to write your own prompts relevant to your business or product.\n\nJust remember to always review ChatGPT’s outputs for accuracy and ensure they have a human touch.\n\nWant more help with writing relevant and effective content?\n\nTry Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.
