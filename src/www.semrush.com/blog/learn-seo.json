  "content": "Here are the three best ways to learn SEO:\n\n1. Study SEO Basics\n\nMake sure you know the SEO basics before you dive into tools and resources.\n\nLearn What SEO Is\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) describes all processes and techniques designed to help you rank higher in search engines such as Google. \n\nThe higher you rank, the more likely you are to drive people to your pages. So, the primary goal of SEO is to get more organic traffic (unpaid traffic) from search engines.\n\nTip\n\nLearn the basics in our SEO Principles video course to earn a free certificate.\n\nDiscover How Search Engines Work\n\nTo understand how to do SEO, you need a basic understanding of how search engines work. \n\nFirst, search engines have to discover your page. They use programs (called website crawlers or bots) that follow links from known pages to discover new pages. This is called crawling.\n\nAfter the search engine discovers a new page, it analyzes its content and (hopefully) stores it in a huge database of pages called an index (e.g., the Google index). This step is called indexing.\n\nFinally, the search engine uses various algorithms to pick the best and most relevant pages from its index to serve them as ordered search results for users' search queries. This is called ranking. \n\nSEO is all about making sure search engines can crawl and index your pages. And showing search engines that your content is the best (in terms of quality, relevance, and user experience).\n\nNote\n\nThere are numerous issues that can cause problems at each stage—crawling, indexing, and ranking. So, understanding these concepts and how to optimize for them (which we’ll cover later) is key.\n\nUnderstand SEO Ranking Factors\n\nSEO ranking factors are things that affect your website’s and individual pages’ performance in search engine results.\n\nAccording to our ranking factors study, the most important Google ranking factor is text relevance. Meaning how relevant your page’s content is to the user’s query.\n\nGoogle also considers things like:\n\nHow fast your page loads\nThe number of other sites link to your website\nWhether your page uses the secure HTTPS protocol\nKnow the Types of SEO\n\nThe main types of SEO are:\n\nOn-page SEO: Optimizing a specific page to rank better. Tactics include content optimization, title tag optimization, and internal linking.\nOff-page SEO: Doing SEO activities that occur outside of your website. Tactics include link building, content syndication, and social media management.\nTechnical SEO: Improving technical aspects of your site for both search engines and users. Tactics include improving page speed and site architecture.\n\nThere are also SEO tactics for specific content formats, including:\n\nImage SEO: Optimizing images to rank better in regular and image results\nVideo SEO: Optimizing videos to rank better in regular results, image results, video results, and on platforms like YouTube\n\nAnd there are even SEO disciplines for specific types of businesses or websites, such as:\n\nLocal SEO: Tactics that help local businesses rank higher in local results\nInternational SEO: Tactics for websites that serve multiple languages and locations\nEcommerce SEO: Tactics for online stores\nSaaS SEO: Tactics for software as a service (SaaS) businesses\nSmall business SEO: Tactics for small businesses\nB2B SEO: Tactics for business-to-business (B2B) brands\nBuild Essential SEO Skills\n\nSEO covers multiple disciplines and requires several hard skills. Here are the most important skills for SEO:\n\nKeyword Research\n\nKeyword research is the process of discovering search terms (i.e., keywords) that relevant audiences type in search engines. So you can target the ones that are likely to be most beneficial for your business.\n\nA good keyword research tool will help you analyze things like:\n\nSearch volume: The average number of monthly searches for a keyword\nKeyword difficulty: A measure of how hard it’ll be to rank highly in the search results\nSearch intent: The reason behind a user’s search (also known as keyword intent)\n\nTip\n\nCreate your free Semrush account to try our keyword research tools.\n\nPractice Keyword Research\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →\nSERP Analysis\n\nAssessing the search engine results page (SERP) and results for a given keyword is called SERP analysis.\n\nIt allows you to identify SEO ranking opportunities. And work out what you need to do to secure them.\n\nFor example, the SERP for “chocolate cake” is dominated by recipes on popular sites that search engines see as reputable. This means that other types of content and lesser-known sites might struggle to rank here.\n\nYou’ll also notice various SERP features (non-standard search results). Such as rich snippets with star ratings.\n\nIf you were writing a chocolate cake recipe, you could optimize for these elements. With the goal of getting more visibility and clicks.\n\nTip\n\nAnalyze the SERP in your chosen country, region, or city with the Keyword Overview tool. \n\nContent Creation\n\nContent creation is an important part of SEO because it gives search engines something to evaluate and rank.\n\nFor the best results, you’ll need to:\n\nCome up with relevant content ideas or blog ideas\nTake advantage of content creation tools\nCreate quality content that’s tailored to your target audience\nDistribute your content across various channels\n\nGenerally, Google wants to rank unique content that demonstrates Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). Because it wants to provide helpful and reliable results to users.\n\nThis means your content should be accurate, comprehensive, and relevant to your brand.\n\nOn-Page Optimization\n\nOn-page optimization is the process of improving the technical and content aspects of your webpages. To make them more user-friendly and relevant to your target keywords. \n\nAnd it helps you rank higher in search engines and attract more organic traffic to your site.\n\nSome of the key elements of on-page optimization are:\n\nTitle tags: The clickable headlines that can appear in search results. They should include your main keyword and a compelling value proposition that entices users to click on your page.\nMeta descriptions: The snippets of text that may appear below headlines in search results. They should provide a concise summary of your page and include a call to action that encourages users to click.\nHeaders: The subheadings that structure your content and make it easier to read and scan. They should use relevant keywords and follow a logical hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.).\nContent: The main body of your page that provides useful and engaging information to your audience. It should cover your topic in depth, answer the searchers’ questions, and use natural language and variations of your keywords.\nImages: The visual elements that enhance your page content and appeal to your audience. They should have descriptive alt text that describes what the image shows and include your keywords when relevant.\nInternal links: The links that connect your pages to each other and help users navigate your site. They should use descriptive anchor text that indicates what the linked page is about.\n\nTo do on-page optimization, use a tool that can analyze your pages at scale. \n\nFor example, On Page SEO Checker pinpoints weaknesses and provides suggestions on how to improve pages across your site. \n\nTechnical SEO\n\nTechnical SEO involves improving various technical aspects of your website. The goal is to make sure search engines can crawl and index your website properly. \n\nThis includes things like:\n\nHaving an XML sitemap (a file that lists all the pages you want search engines to index)\nCreating a robots.txt file (a file that tells search engines which pages on your site should be crawled)\nUsing meta robots tags (HTML that tells search engines how to crawl, index, and display a particular page)\nImplementing structured data (code that helps search engines better understand your content)\n\nTip\n\nEnroll in our free video course for technical SEO.\n\nMuch of technical SEO is about improving website performance and the user experience.\n\nThings like:\n\nMobile-friendliness\nCore Web Vitals (a set of metrics that score your pages for user experience)\nHTTPS (which relates to website security)\n\nYou can conduct a technical SEO audit to identify and prioritize issues on your site. \n\nTry it out now with Semrush’s Site Audit tool. You can then work to address all your “Errors” (the most severe issues, and then move on to “Warnings” and “Notices.”\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nLink Building\n\nLink building is a set of practices aimed at increasing the number of links you get from relevant, quality sites. \n\nIt’s important because search engines can treat these kinds of links (backlinks) as indicators of your site’s trustworthiness and quality.\n\nThe idea is simple: \n\nIf many authoritative pages link to a certain page, that page is also considered to be authoritative. This is why link building has always been an important part of SEO.\n\nOur backlink management course can help you learn the basics in less than an hour.\n\nTip\n\nSemrush has a variety of link building tools that help you save time and get better results.\n\nWebsite Architecture\n\nWebsite architecture is the hierarchical structure of your webpages and how they’re linked together. It affects both the user experience and your SEO performance.\n\nHere’s a visual example of website structure:\n\nA good website architecture should:\n\nHelp users easily find the information they need and navigate your site smoothly\nHelp search engines crawl and index your site efficiently and understand the relationships between your pages\nDistribute your page authority evenly and boost your topical authority for your target keywords\nSEO Performance Monitoring\n\nBeing able to track and analyze SEO results is a vital skill. Because it tells you what strategies work best for your business.\n\nIt’s a good idea to monitor SEO key performance indicators (KPIs) like:\n\nKeyword rankings\nOrganic traffic\nOrganic conversions\n\nTip\n\nSign up for ranking alerts through Semrush’s Position Tracking tool. So you can act on changes as soon as possible.\n\n2. Learn by Doing\n\nThe best way to learn SEO is to put your knowledge into practice. \n\nYou may already have a website where you want to apply what you’re learning about SEO. If you don't, here are a few options: \n\nStart a blog on any topic you feel passionate about. And try to rank for a couple of keywords.\nStart a side project (e.g., an affiliate website) that may transform into an additional source of income\nHelp a friend or a family member optimize their website for free\n\nEvery niche is a little different. So, even if you have a business website, it may help you to also run a personal project where you can experiment freely. \n\nThe more websites you work on, the more SEO experience you'll gain.\n\nWhen picking a blog niche (or a niche for another side project), make sure it’s something that:\n\nYou’re interested in\nYou know a lot about\nYou can make money from\n\nDon't be afraid to try new things like SEO split testing and learn from your mistakes.\n\nAlong the way, you’ll need to use some SEO tools. Like Google Search Console.\n\nSet Up and Learn Google Search Console\n\nGoogle Search Console is a free Google tool that allows you to monitor your site’s performance in Google Search. As well as various aspects of technical SEO.\n\nHere are some of the reports you'll see when you sign into Google Search Console: \n\nSearch results report: Data about how your website performs in Google search results\nPage indexing report: A list of all the pages that have been successfully indexed. Plus those that have been excluded and the reasons why.\nPage experience report: An overview of your site's performance in terms of usability\n\nAll of these are useful reports you'll make use of sooner or later.\n\nGet Acquainted with an SEO Tool Set\n\nIf you run a business website, a quality SEO tool set is an investment that will definitely pay off. Not only will it help you make informed SEO decisions based on data, but it will also save you a lot of time. \n\nAnd it gives you a competitive advantage over competitors that use only free SEO tools (or no tools at all).\n\nWhen choosing your SEO tools, make sure to look for at least these basics:\n\nKeyword research tool\nCompetitor analysis tool\nRank tracking tool\nOn-page analysis tool\nTechnical audit tool\nLink building tool\n\nYou may need other tools based on your particular needs.
