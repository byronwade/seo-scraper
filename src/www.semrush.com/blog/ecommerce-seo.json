Perform Keyword Research\n\nThe first step of any ecommerce SEO campaign is to perform keyword research.\n\nKeyword research is the process of finding which words or phrases (keywords) people use to search for your products online.\n\nYou need to use the same keywords to optimize your product and category pages. So they rank higher for those keywords and bring traffic to your website.\n\nWe’ll cover how to optimize your pages later in this guide. But before that, let’s go over four ways to do keyword research.\n\nUse Keyword Magic Tool\n\nA sophisticated keyword research tool like Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool can come in handy.\n\nLet’s say your ecommerce site sells dog food. All you need to do is type “dog food” into the search box and click “Search.”\n\nAnd the tool will show you a list of related keywords that people search for on Google.\n\nHaving access to all these keyword ideas is great. But how do you know which ones are the best?\n\nFirst, check which ones are relevant for your online store. \n\nThese will be keywords related to the product or category pages on your site.\n\nFor example, if you have a category page selling dry dog food, the keyword “dry dog food” could be an excellent choice.\n\nClick on the keyword group on the left hand side to see all keywords belonging to that category.\n\nNow, you need to filter for search intent.\n\nSearch intent is the underlying reason why someone opens up Google and types in a search term.\n\nThe main types of search intent are:\n\nNavigational: Users want to find a specific website or page. For example, “Walmart login” or “Walmart plus.\nInformational: Users want to learn more about something. For example, “how much food to feed my dog.” \nCommercial: Users want to review different products before making a purchase decision. For example, “best dry dog food.”\nTransactional: Users want to buy something online. For example, “buy dog food online.” \n\nSearch intent is an important concept for ecommerce SEO. Because you want to ensure that the pages on your site align with people’s expectations.\n\nFor example, a keyword like “dry dog food” has strong commercial search intent.\n\nHow do we know?\n\nAlmost all the top-ranking pages are category pages letting users explore and review different dry foods for dogs.\n\nSo, you need to optimize your category page around this keyword.\n\nOn the other hand, the keyword “how much food to feed my dog” is informational. \n\nAll the top-ranking pages are articles:\n\nSo, that keyword would be a good fit for an article.\n\nThe “Intent” filter in the Keyword Magic Tool makes the task of filtering commercial and transactional keywords much faster.\n\nThat way, you can drill down specifically into keywords that would be good fits for product and category pages.\n\nLastly, look at keyword metrics like search volume and keyword difficulty.\n\nSearch volume tells you the average number of times a keyword is searched each month.\n\nAnd keyword difficulty tells you how difficult it is to rank for a particular keyword.\n\nIt’s a percentage on a scale from 0 to 100. And the higher the percentage is, the harder it is to rank at the top of search results. \n\nIf your ecommerce site is new, you probably won’t rank for keywords with high difficulty scores. Because you don’t have enough backlinks—which Google heavily considers when ranking pages.\n\nSo, pick keywords with low keyword difficulty scores—anything under 30 would be ideal.\n\nThis is just one of many methods for finding keywords. Let’s see some other methods as well.\n\nFind Keywords for Your Ecommerce Site\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nUse Google Search Features\n\nGoogle search features like Google autocomplete and related searches are excellent sources of keyword ideas for ecommerce sites.\n\nGoogle autocomplete is a Google search feature that makes it faster to complete searches when users start to type.\n\nJust enter what your business sells into the search box.\n\nThen, Google will automatically suggest related keywords. \n\nThese suggestions are based on what people are actively searching for (as well as their location, and what they’ve searched for in the past).\n\nConsider adding space at the beginning of your query to get even more keyword ideas\n\nObviously, many of these won’t be a good fit for one reason or another.\n\nFor example, your store doesn’t sell a particular product. Or the keyword belongs to a competitor.\n\nBut with a little bit of digging, you should have no problem identifying at least a few keywords that are relevant.\n\nOnce you find some, use Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool to look into their metrics.\n\nOpen the tool and enter your keywords one by one. Then, click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see the search intent (indicated using “I” for “Informational,” “N” for “Navigational,” “C” for “Commercial,” and “T” for “Transactional”) for each keyword.\n\nAs well as their search volume and keyword difficulty.\n\nConsider these metrics to decide which keywords are worth targeting.\n\nAnother great way to find keywords is to check out the “Related searches” section at the bottom of Google’s search results.\n\nFirst, search Google for the product your business sells.\n\nThen, scroll down until you see the box labeled “Related searches.” You’ll notice a number of keywords closely related to the searched term.\n\nThese keyword ideas come straight from Google. Which means a lot of people are already searching for these keywords.\n\nWant to get even more keyword ideas?\n\nClick on one of the listed terms among your options. \n\nThen, scroll down on the new page. And you’ll have more keywords. \n\nOnce again, analyze these keywords with the Keyword Overview tool so you can decide which ones are worth pursuing.\n\nAnalyze Your Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUse Amazon Features\n\nSimilar to Google, Amazon has an autocomplete feature that shows popular searches that are related to your product.\n\nJust start typing, and you’ll get suggestions.\n\nMake note of all the keywords that seem relevant to your business.\n\nThen, plug them into the Keyword Overview tool to analyze them further.\n\nBrowse Subreddits\n\nReddit is another platform that can provide good keyword ideas for your ecommerce site.\n\nHead over to Reddit and search for your product.\n\nIt will quickly return subreddits that discuss your product. This is exactly where your target audience hangs out on the platform.\n\nJoin these subreddits. Then, see which words and phrases members use when they talk about your products.\n\nFor example, “dry food” and “wet food” cropped up multiple times in one of these subreddits.\n\nUse the Ecommerce Keyword Analytics App\n\nSemrush’s App Center has lots of keyword research-related tools. Like Ecommerce Keyword Analytics.\n\nIt collects data from the top global retail websites. And can help you find high-converting ecommerce keywords.\n\nFor example, want to see which dog food-related keywords convert the best on sites like walmart.com, amazon.com, and bestbuy.com?\n\nJust search this app, and it will be able to show you tons of metrics about your keywords. Including the total number of orders placed and the conversion rate.\n\nThis lets you find keywords that are not only popular, but also high-converting.\n\nLeverage the Product Research Pulse App\n\nProduct Research Pulse can show you what products are currently popular and how consumers find them across major online marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, and Walmart.\n\nTo begin, go to the tool and click on “Solutions” > “Identify by Keywords.”\n\nThen, choose the market that you want to analyze and hit the magnifying glass button.\n\nNow you have a list of products related to your keyword listed in the Amazon US store.\n\nUse this list to find potential high-value products. That you could profit from based on popular searches\n\nCheck Your Competitors’ Keywords\n\nFinding which keywords your competitors already rank for is one of the best ways to uncover more keywords for your ecommerce site.\n\nAll you need to do is enter a competitor’s homepage into Semrush’s Organic Research tool.\n\nIf you own a pet store, for example, you’d want to check out Chewy.\n\nAnd the tool will show you the exact keywords they rank for.\n\nGo through the list and look for keywords you haven’t encountered before.\n\nFind Competitors’ Keywords\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nBy following all the research methods above, you’ll be able to find enough keywords for each category and product page on your site.\n\nThe next step is to logically organize these pages.\n\n2. Improve Your Site’s Architecture\n\nSite architecture is how your pages are organized within your site.\n\nIt’s an important technical SEO consideration for any ecommerce site. (Technical SEO is focused on improving all of the technical aspects of your site that affect your SEO.)\n\nThat’s because an optimized architecture:\n\nHelps Google crawl (discover) all of your product and category pages\nMakes it easy for users to find products\nTransfers link equity (ranking strength) throughout your site to improve rankings\n\nBut how do you improve your site architecture?\n\nOrganize your site in a way that enables visitors to reach any product from your homepage in just a few clicks.\n\nFor example, let’s look at ecommerce giant Chewy.\n\nThanks to a well-organized drop-down menu, you can get from their homepage to a product page in just two clicks. Here’s how:\n\nNow, you only need to click once more to get to an individual product page. \n\nSo, this site structure isn’t just ideal for UX—it’s great for SEO too. Because it makes it easier for search engines to crawl your entire site.\n\nA great way to achieve this structure is by connecting your homepage to category pages. And then connecting category pages to individual pages on your site.\n\nLike this: \n\nAlso, when defining categories, make use of your keywords.\n\nNot only will that help in SEO, but it will also help users find what they’re looking for faster.\n\nSo, using the example site structure from above, we can define categories like this:\n\n3. Manage Other Technical SEO Tasks\n\nImproving your site structure is just one of many technical SEO activities.\n\nHere are some of the other things you need to take care of:\n\nMake Sure You’re Using HTTPS\n\nHypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is a collection of rules that enable web browsers to communicate with web servers. And HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP.\n\nIt encrypts the data visitors exchange with your ecommerce site. Like passwords and credit card information. And prevents hackers from stealing it.\n\nHTTPS also improves your website’s rankings in Google.\n\nGoogle has confirmed this.\n\nTo see whether your website uses HTTPS, you can visit it and look for the lock icon in the address bar. \n\nIf it’s present, that means your website is secure.\n\nIf you instead see a “Not secure” warning and no lock, your website isn’t using HTTPS.\n\nTo fix this, you need to install a secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate. \n\nAn SSL certificate verifies the identity of your website and creates a secure connection between your server and your visitors’ browsers.\n\nYou can get this certificate from your hosting provider.\n\nMake Your Online Store Mobile-Friendly\n\nGoogle ranks websites based on how well they work on mobile devices.\n\nTo check if your online store is mobile-friendly, you can use Chrome DevTools.\n\nFirst, open the webpage you want to test, then right-click anywhere on the page.\n\nA small menu will pop up. Click on “Inspect.”\n\nThis will open up a DevTools panel on the right side of the page.\n\nNow, from the panel’s toolbar, click on the two arrows at the end. And select the “Lighthouse” option.\n\nA new settings window will appear. From here, select the “SEO” category from the available categories and click “Analyze page load.”\n\nYou’ll see a detailed report like this:\n\nNow, expand the “PASSED AUDITS” section.\n\nYou’ll find whether your page passed audits related to being mobile-friendly. Like:\n\nHaving a viewport meta tag\nUsing legible font sizes\nHaving tap targets (buttons) spaced appropriately.\n\nIf your page is not mobile-friendly, here are some best practices you can follow:\n\nUse a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and use a meta viewport tag\nMake sure text is readable on small screens without the need for zooming in\nLeave enough space between links, buttons, and other clickable elements\n\nRead our guide to mobile SEO to learn more. \n\nSubmit Your Sitemap to Google\n\nA sitemap is a file that includes a list of all pages on your website (product pages, categories, etc.).\n\nSince ecommerce sites usually have lots of pages, having a sitemap is very useful.\n\nIt helps search engines find these pages. Which means they can be indexed (stored in search engine databases) and appear in search results.\n\nHere’s online pet store Petsy’s sitemap.\n\nMost ecommerce content management systems (CMSs), including Shopify, create your sitemap automatically.\n\nIt’s usually found at one of these two URLs:\n\nyoursite.com/sitemap_index.xml (This is the URL for the sitemap index file, which lists the sitemap files for different sections of the website, such as products, collections, blogs, etc.)\nyoursite.com/sitemap.xml (This is the URL for the sitemap file, which contains all the URLs of the website in one file.)\n\nOnce you find yours, all you need to do is submit it to Google. \n\nTo submit your sitemap to Google, you need to use Google Search Console (GSC).\n\nIf you haven’t set up GSC yet, read our full guide on Search Console to learn how to do it.\n\nOnce you’ve set it up, navigate to “Indexing” > “Sitemaps” in the sidebar.\n\nPaste your sitemap URL in the box and click “Submit.”\n\nYou should see a message like this when Google finishes processing your sitemap:\n\nImprove Your Page Speed\n\nPage speed is how fast your webpage loads. And it’s an important consideration for ecommerce sites.\n\nIf your webpage takes a long time to load, it will negatively affect the user experience. And users might abandon your store. \n\nIt’ll also affect your store’s SEO rankings.\n\nSo, you should optimize your page speed.\n\nYou can use PageSpeed Insights to measure your webpages’ speed. \n\nYou’ll get a score from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the better your page is. \n\nTo increase your page speed, you can try a few things.\n\nFirst, minify your code. \n\nMinification is the process of removing unnecessary characters and spaces from your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. \n\nThis makes them smaller and helps them load faster.\n\nSecond, compress your images.\n\nImages are often the largest files on a webpage, so they take longer to load. \n\nYou can use tools like Shortpixel to reduce the file size of your images without losing quality.\n\nAnd third, use a content delivery network (CDN).\n\nA CDN is a network of servers around the world that store copies of your webpages.\n\nWhen a visitor requests a page from your site, the CDN delivers it from the closest server. Which reduces the time it takes to load the files.\n\nFind and Fix Other Technical SEO Issues\n\nTechnical SEO issues are a serious problem for any website. But especially for ecommerce websites, as they tend to have lots of pages.\n\nHere are two ways to get a feel for how your ecommerce site’s overall technical SEO stacks up.\n\nFirst, check out the “Pages” report in Google Search Console.\n\nThis report shows you if Google has found any technical SEO problems that may be impacting your visibility in Google.\n\nYou want to pay special attention to the “Why pages aren’t indexed” section.\n\nAll your important pages should be indexed. Otherwise, they have no chance of ranking.\n\nAnd this report tells you why Google may not be indexing certain pages on your site.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper, use Semrush’s Site Audit tool. It can help ecommerce site owners uncover all the technical issues their website is facing.\n\nSite Audit can help you find:\n\nDuplicate content: Can be a common issue for ecommerce sites \nSlow page load speed: Can impact conversion rates and keyword rankings\nBroken internal links: Can be bad for usability and signal to search engines that a website is of low quality\nBroken images: Can hurt your site’s UX\n4xx codes: Can happen due to broken links and cause crawling issues\nPages containing large JavaScript and CSS files: Can impact page load time\nCore Web Vitals issues: Can make your website slower and less smooth to use\n\nThe tool also provides advice on how to fix each issue.\n\nFind & Fix Technical SEO Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Optimize for On-Page SEO \n\nNow that you’ve fixed any technical SEO issues, it’s time to dive into on-page SEO.\n\nOn-page SEO is the practice of optimizing individual webpages to rank higher in search results.\n\nFor ecommerce sites, these are mainly going to be product and category pages.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nOptimize Your Title Tags\n\nA title tag is a title of a webpage that appears in search results.\n\nTitle tags are among the most important parts of on-page optimization. (Not just for ecommerce sites, but for any type of website.)\n\nGoogle looks at your title tag to understand your page’s topic. So it can rank it appropriately.\n\nOverall, your title tag should:\n\nBe fewer than 60 characters long\nDescribe the page’s content\nUse a target keyword\nEntice Google searchers to click on it\n\nHere are a few extra things you can do to get even better results from your title tags:\n\nMention a deal (e.g., “25% off”)\nInclude a compelling benefit (e.g., “[Free Shipping]”)\nDescribe what makes your product unique (e.g., “Best,” Fastest,” “Lightest”)\n\nHere’s an example of a well-written ecommerce title tag:\n\nIf you want to check whether your title tags are optimized for SEO, you can use Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker tool.\n\nThe tool highlights whether your title tag includes your target keywords naturally—i.e., without forcibly stuffing the keywords into it.\n\nCheck Whether Your Title Tags Are Optimized\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\nOptimize Your Meta Descriptions\n\nMeta descriptions usually appear directly below the title tag in search results.\n\nGoogle doesn’t consider your meta description for ranking purposes. But users consider the text that appears below the title tag when deciding which search result to click on.\n\nSo, how do you actually write them?\n\nHere are some quick tips:\n\nCap your meta description length at approximately 105 characters\nMake each meta description unique\nExplain exactly why a shopper should click on your site. Featuring perks (“free shipping,” “save X%,” “buy one, get one”) are simple ways to grab a user’s attention.\nInclude your target keyword\n\nYou can use Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker to find out whether your meta descriptions are optimized for SEO.\n\nThe tool shows if your target keywords appear naturally.\n\nCheck Whether Your Meta Descriptions Are Optimized\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\nCreate an SEO-Friendly URL Structure\n\nGoogle displays a URL in search results to let users know where they’ll land if they click on a page.\n\nHere are some best practices to follow when creating URLs on your ecommerce site:\n\nKeep them short and descriptive. This ensures Google won’t truncate your URLs in search results.\nUse hyphens to separate words. This is preferred to using underscores.\nUse lowercase text. This is a general rule of thumb.\nAvoid dates in URLs. This makes your content seem outdated.\nInclude your primary keyword. This is a best practice, but don’t force keywords unnaturally.\nOptimize Your Product Images\n\nOptimizing your product images is important if you want them to rank in Google’s image search results. Which can send some additional traffic to your site.\n\nHow do you optimize them?\n\nFirst, name your images appropriately.\n\nFile names give clues to Google about the image’s subject matter.\n\nFor example, “dietary-dog-food.jpg” is a better file name than “IMG_1245.jpg.”\n\nSecond, include descriptive alternative text (called alt text for short).\n\nAlt text also helps Google understand the image’s subject matter. So, describe what an image is. But keep it short.\n\nAnd third, make sure you’re using compressed images. Because large images can slow down page loading. \n\nYou can compress your images with tools like ShortPixel before using them on your site.\n\nInclude Unique Content on Each Page\n\nEach page on your site should have unique content. \n\nThat’s a must if you want to rank in Google.\n\nIf your site has thousands of products, writing unique content for each of them won’t be easy.\n\nSo, here’s the template you should follow for each element on the product page:\n\nProduct name: Use the specific product name, for example, “Pedigree Complete Nutrition Grilled Steak, Dry Dog Food.” Don’t just say “Pedigree.”\nProduct description: Write a short (50 to 100 words) description highlighting the key features and benefits of that particular product. Don’t just copy generic descriptions.\nFeatures: List the specific features of that product, including details like ingredients, nutritional facts, health benefits, etc. Don’t just list the same generic features for every product.\nLonger description: Provide a detailed paragraph summarizing the product and key selling points.\n\nThis provides a better experience for visitors and signals to Google that each page offers distinct value.\n\nHowever, there are some cases where duplicate content is unavoidable, such as when you have different versions of your pages in different languages (to cater to different regions).\n\nIn this case, you should use hreflang tags to tell Google which version of your page is preferred and relevant for each language or region.\n\nFocus on Internal Linking\n\nInternal linking involves linking directly to other pages on your site.\n\nWhen done correctly, internal linking can boost your SEO. Because internal links funnel authority (ranking strength) throughout your site.\n\nHow do you implement internal linking?\n\nOne of the best ways is to show related products on each product page.\n\nLike this:\n\nAdd Schema Markup\n\nSchema markup is a type of code that helps Google better understand your pages.\n\nBy adding schema, your pages can earn rich snippets.\n\nRich snippets display extra information below the title tag and description. Which makes your website more noticeable and can potentially boost your click-through rate (CTR).\n\nGoogle supports many different types of schema markup. But for ecommerce sites, product markup is the most relevant type.\n\nHere’s what a sample code might look like for a product page selling dog food:\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n\"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\", \n\"@type\": \"Product\", \n\"name\": \"Premium Dog Food\",\n\"image\": \"https://example.com/photos/4x3/photo.jpg\",\n\"brand\": {\n\"@type\": \"Brand\",\n\"name\": \"Your Online Store\"\n},\n\"offers\": {\n\"@type\": \"Offer\",\n\"url\": \"\",\n\"priceCurrency\": \"USD\",\n\"price\": \"99\",\n\"availability\": \"https://schema.org/InStock\",\n\"itemCondition\": \"https://schema.org/NewCondition\"\n},\n\"aggregateRating\": {\n\"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n\"ratingValue\": \"4.2\"\n}\n}\n</script>\n\nYou don’t need to write this code manually. There are many free markup generator tools available that can generate this code for you (e.g., Merkle).\n\n5. Leverage Content Marketing\n\nA successful ecommerce site is more than a collection of optimized product and category pages.\n\nYou also need to invest in content marketing and start creating other types of content.\n\nThis can help your ecommerce site’s SEO by:\n\nBringing in targeted traffic (when you create content your customers are interested in)\nGenerating backlinks (when other sites notice and link to your content)\nBuilding a well-known brand (as you consistently publish valuable content)\nProviding value to potential customers (when your content is helpful)\n\nHere’s how to get started:\n\nCreate Blog Posts\n\nBlogging is one of the most popular and effective forms of content marketing. \n\nTake online store Rover as an example of a brand that uses this tactic. They consistently create engaging blog posts:\n\nThese blog posts are optimized around keywords their target audience searches for (when they’re not searching for a specific product).\n\nFor example, this post is optimized around the informational keyword “new puppy checklist.”\n\nThere are over 5,000 people searching for this on Google globally.\n\nAnd as you can see, the content provides value. But also promotes some of their products when it makes sense.\n\nPeople searching for this term are probably more in the browsing stage. But a certain percentage of folks that land on this page will likely make a purchase.\n\nNow, the real question is this: how do you find blog topic ideas for your ecommerce site?\n\nEasy.\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nOpen the tool and enter a broad keyword related to your niche.\n\nSo, if your ecommerce site sells dog food, search for “dog food.”\n\nThen, filter the keywords list to only show informational keywords.\n\nInformational keywords are pretty much what you’d expect: keywords that people use when they’re searching for helpful content.\n\nLooking at these keywords, you can identify some promising blog topics. \n\nOnce you find some, you need to start creating content based on those keywords.\n\nIf you’re new to content writing, check out our article about how to write blog posts to get started.\n\nFind Blog Topic Ideas\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nShare & Promote Your Blog Content\n\nAfter you create your blog content and publish it on your ecommerce site, it won’t rank and start bringing in traffic immediately. (Unless you’re an established player in your niche.)\n\nSo, it’s worth promoting it to get some early traction.\n\nHere are some ways you can do that:\n\nFirst, share your blog content on social media platforms. This is a great way to spread the word about your blog and drive traffic to your site. \n\nYou can use platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and LinkedIn to share your blog posts with your followers and potential customers.\n\nSecond, share the blog content with your email list.\n\nA well-crafted newsletter can not only drive traffic, but it can also increase conversions.\n\nAnd third, engage in online communities like online forums, subreddits (smaller communities within Reddit), or Facebook groups where your target audience hangs out. \n\nBut don’t just post links to your blog—that’s likely to be seen as spam. \n\nInstead, provide valuable input and share your blog content when it’s genuinely relevant and useful to the conversation.\n\nBy using a combination of these methods, you’ll get more eyeballs on your blog content.\n\n6. Build Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are one of the most important ranking factors for Google. Which is why link building needs to be part of every ecommerce SEO strategy.\n\nHere’s how you can get started:\n\nClaim Unlinked Mentions\n\nUnlinked mentions are when someone mentions your brand or product online without linking to your site. \n\nFor example, a mention of Chewy or its dog food that doesn’t have a link to chewy.com.\n\nPages with unlinked mentions are often good prospects for link building because:\n\nThe authors know your brand. So, they’re more likely to respond to your outreach. And link to you.\nThe authors like your product. This may not apply to all, but it does to at least some of them. And those ones might consider linking.\n\nBut first, you need to find your unlinked mentions.\n\nUse Semrush’s Brand Monitoring app for this.\n\nFirst, configure the tool. And make sure to set up monitoring for your brand name.\n\nAfter that, you’ll get a report listing pages that mention your brand name but might not link to you.\n\nFor any unlinked mentions you want to claim, all you have to do is send an outreach email asking them to make the mention clickable.\n\nIf you’re new to outreach, check out our email outreach guide to learn how to write an effective outreach email.\n\nPerform Backlink Gap Analysis\n\nBacklink gap analysis is a technique that helps you find websites that link to your competitors but not to you.\n\nThe idea is if they’re linking to your competitors, they might consider linking to you, too.\n\nSemrush’s Backlink Gap tool can help you conduct this analysis.\n\nStart by entering your domain name. And the tool will auto-suggest a list of your competitors to get you started.\n\nIt then analyzes your competitors’ backlink profiles. And generates a list of sites that link to your competitors—but not to you.\n\nLet’s pretend you’re the online pet store Chewy. The third line in the chart above shows you that livescience.com links out to your competitors.\n\nClicking on the arrow beside the numbers under each competitor in the table will show you the specific articles that link to those competitors.\n\nFrom there, open these pages and try to figure out why they linked to your competitors.\n\nIs it because of their content quality?\n\nIf so, check to see whether you have a similar, better content that you can pitch as a replacement.\n\nIf you do, send an outreach email explaining why your piece is better.\n\nThey might link to you if you make a compelling case.\n\nDiscover Backlink Opportunities\n\nwith the Backlink Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nLeverage HARO\n\nHelp a Reporter Out (HARO) is a service that can help you get high-quality backlinks to your ecommerce site.\n\nHARO works by connecting journalists with industry experts. Because journalists often need an expert’s opinion for their articles.\n\nIf they include yours, they might link to your website.\n\nGo to HARO’s website and sign up as a source.\n\nEvery day, you’ll receive emails with journalist queries. \n\nLike this:\n\nIf you find a relevant query, click on it to see more details.\n\nLook for one that aligns with your expertise. Then, respond to the request by providing a valuable contribution.\n\nThis means giving detailed answers to all the questions in the query.\n\nYou can also share your contact details, including a website link. So that if they decide to feature you, they can link to your website.\n\nGet Links from Your Suppliers or Distributors\n\nIf you’re a reseller or retail ecommerce seller, contact the supplier or distributor that curates lists informing people where they can purchase the products. \n\nThen, ask for your site to be included. \n\nThis is an easy way to get a backlink.\n\nThis example of Greenies’ vendors page is the type of list you want your site to be on:\n\nLooking for more link-building tips? Take a look at our link building strategies guide.\n\n7. Measure SEO Performance\n\nYou’ve optimized your pages for on-page SEO, created new content, and built backlinks. But how do you know whether your efforts are yielding results?\n\nBy measuring your SEO performance.\n\nHere’s how to do that:\n\nCheck Your Organic Traffic\n\nOrganic traffic is all the unpaid clicks that originate from search engines.\n\nAnd if your organic traffic is growing, that means you’ve improved SEO for your online store.\n\nTo check your organic traffic over time, go to Google Search Console and select the “Search results” report under the “Performance” tab from the sidebar.\n\nThen look at the click-related data:\n\nYou can also apply filters to exclude branded traffic (traffic from people who search for your brand name) to get a more accurate view of your SEO performance.\n\nJust click on the plus icon, select “query,” then the “query not containing” option from the drop-down, mention your brand name, and click “Apply.”\n\nThis helps you separate your SEO performance from your overall marketing efforts.\n\nSEO plays a role in brand awareness, but it can’t claim all the credit for it.\n\nCheck Your Keyword Positions\n\nKeyword positions refer to your webpages’ rankings in the search results for specific keywords.\n\nMeasuring this is important because it tells you how visible your site is to potential customers who search for your products and other terms related to your niche.\n\nGenerally, the higher your ranking position, the more organic traffic you’ll get.\n\nTo measure your ranking positions, you can use a rank tracking tool like Semrush’s Position Tracking.\n\nThis tool allows you to set up a project for your website and track the rankings of hundreds of keywords that you want to rank for. \n\nYou’ll see how your rankings change over time and get email alerts about your progress for your tracked keywords.\n\nCheck Your Rankings with Ease\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nTrack Your Organic Conversions\n\nOrganic conversions are the actions that you want your organic visitors to take on your website. Like making a purchase.\n\nOrganic conversions are the ultimate goal of SEO. As they show how well your ecommerce site is converting potential customers into actual customers.\n\nTo measure your organic conversions, you need to set up conversions in Google Analytics.\n\nOnce you’ve set up conversions, log into your Google Analytics account. Then, go to “Reports” > “Acquisition” > “User acquisition” and check the Organic Search row. \n\nYou’ll see how many organic conversions your site achieved in a given period.\n\nEcommerce SEO Tools\n\nDoing SEO for ecommerce sites is incredibly difficult without specialized tools. \n\nWhether you want to generate keyword ideas, find technical SEO issues, or build backlinks, ecommerce SEO tools help with nearly every step involved in the optimization process.\n\nBelow is a list of tools that we recommend you use.\n\nSemrush’s SEO Toolkit\n\nSemrush’s SEO toolkit has pretty much everything you need to succeed with ecommerce SEO.\n\nIt covers various aspects of ecommerce SEO, such as:\n\nKeyword research: You can use Keyword Magic Tool to find keywords for your product and category pages.
