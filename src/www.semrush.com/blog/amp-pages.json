  "content": "What Is AMP? \n\nAMP (previously known as Accelerated Mobile Pages) is an open-source HTML framework that helps create fast-loading mobile-optimized webpages.\n\nSo, an AMP page is, essentially, a stripped-down version of a regular webpage.\n\nAnd it can look like this:\n\nGoogle spearheaded the open-source project to compete against Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News. \n\nBoth of which allowed publishers to create content that loaded fast and was easy to consume. \n\nGoogle first served AMP pages in mobile search results in 2016. And they were restricted to a “Top Stories” section at the top of the SERPs. \n\nLike this:\n\nIt was originally designed for news publishers. But has since expanded to include all types of webpages.\n\nGet a team account\n\nTo save on Semrush subscription\n\nLearn more →\nHow Does AMP Work?\n\nThe AMP framework consists of three basic components:\n\nAMP HTML\nAMP JavaScript\nAMP Cache\nAMP HTML\n\nAMP HTML is HTML with certain restrictions to ensure pages load quickly. It removes or modifies some elements and attributes that can slow down webpages. \n\nA simple HTML file can look like this:\n\nFundamentally, AMP HTML documents must:\n\nStart with <!doctype html> (to send information to the browser about what type of document to expect)\nInclude a top-level <html ⚡> or <html amp> tag (to indicate it’s an AMP HTML page)\nInclude <head> and <body> tags (to define the document’s content, i.e. headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, etc.)\nInclude a <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"URL\"> (to indicate the regular HTML version of the page or to link to itself if no regular page exists)\nInclude a <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> tag (to specify the character encoding)\nInclude a <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\"> tag (to give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions)\nInclude a <script async src=\"https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js\"><script> tag (to add extensions to the base library)\nInclude the AMP boilerplate code (head > style[amp-boilerplate] and noscript > style[amp-boilerplate]) in the head tag\n\nFor more details regarding special tags, attributes, and templates, check out AMP’s official AMP HTML documentation. \n\nAMP JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is tricky because too much JS can make webpages slow and unresponsive. \n\nHowever, AMP’s JavaScript library contains frameworks and components that let you build pages quickly without writing JS or importing third-party libraries. \n\nAll of which are crucial to the reader’s experience. \n\nAMP Cache\n\nThe AMP Cache is a proxy-based content delivery network (CDN) that pre-fetches and pre-renders AMP pages before they’re requested by users. \n\nAnd it’s game-changing for site speed. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it lets your site load multiple parts from different servers at once. And it also allows visitors to load your site from the server that is closest to them. \n\nMeaning your website loads super fast for more people. \n\nAnd there are currently two main AMP Cache providers: \n\nGoogle AMP Cache\nBing AMP Cache\n\nThese platforms cache your pages when you use the AMP format. \n\nFor example, cache providers can discover your AMP page via the <html ⚡> or <html amp> tag and cache its content. \n\nOr a publisher can manually add the page to the AMP Cache (only applicable to the Google AMP Cache). \n\nOther platforms can access cached AMP pages via their URL.\n\nFor example, if you put /amp at the end of any news story on The Guardian, you’ll see the AMP version. \n\nLike this:\n\nPro tip: If you’re not sure if your site has AMP pages, you can check using Semrush’s Site Audit Tool. \n\nStart by adding your domain name and clicking “Start Audit.”\n\nThen, head to the “Statistics” tab in your dashboard and you’ll see a row that says “AMP Links.” \n\nLike this:\n\nCheck Your AMP Pages\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nWhat Are the Advantages and Limitations of AMP Pages? \n\nWhile AMP can improve your page’s performance and user experience, it also has certain disadvantages. \n\nLet’s take a look at the pros and cons of AMP pages:\n\nAMP Advantages\nPage loading is almost instant \nPages are easy to build \nImproves user experience on mobile\nAllows custom designs \nMultiple platforms, including Google and Bing support it\nAMP Limitations\nGoogle no longer displays the AMP badge icon to indicate AMP content \nDesign elements are very restricted \nAMP pages allow only one advertisement tag per page\nHow to Set Up AMP on Your Website\n\nYou can create AMP pages by following the HTML markup or by using a CMS (through a plugin or custom functionality). \n\nCreate Your HTML AMP Page\nBasic Code\n\nTo start, here’s the markup of a basic AMP page:\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html amp lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<script async src=\"https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js\"></script>\n<title>Hello, AMPs</title>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" \nhref=\"https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/create/basic_markup/\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" \ncontent=\"width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1\">\n<style amp-boilerplate>body{-webkit-animation:-amp-start 8s \nsteps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;-moz-animation:-amp-start 8s \nsteps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;-ms-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both}@-webkit-keyframes \n-amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-moz-keyframes \n-amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-ms-keyframes \n-amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-o-keyframes \n-amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@keyframes \n-amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}</style><noscript><style \namp-boilerplate>body{-webkit-animation:none;-moz-animation:none;-ms-\nanimation:none;animation:none}</style></noscript>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1 id=\"hello\">Hello AMPHTML World!</h1>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\nAs you can see, the body content is straightforward, but there’s additional code in the head. \n\nTip: use AMP’s snippet “playground” to dabble with and practice with the code. \n\nAdding Images\n\nIf you want to add an image, you need to replace the regular HTML tag with the AMP equivalent. \n\nIn this case, the <amp-img> tag instead of <img>. \n\nTo test it out, copy and paste the following code into your page’s <body>. \n\n<amp-img src=\"https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x400\" width=\"600\" \nheight=\"400\"></amp-img>\n\nAdding Style\n\nThe next step is adding style. \n\nAny styling has to be done using CSS properties. But, AMP states that all CSS be included within a custom tag, called the <style amp-custom> in the <head> of the document. \n\nFor example, try adding the following style to your page:\n\n<style amp-custom>\nh1 {\nmargin: 1rem;\n}\n body {\nbackground-color: green;\n}\n</style>\n\nJavaScript\n\nAMP allows custom JavaScript through the <amp-script> component. \n\nIt lets you write and run your own JS in a way that maintains AMP's performance guarantees. And build pages quickly without coding JavaScript or using external libraries. \n\nFor more in-depth information, read AMP’s guide to using custom JavaScript and follow their AMP JS tutorial to get started. \n\nReview and Validate\n\nA valid AMP page means it follows strict guidelines that ensure it’s eligible for caching and it creates a great user experience. \n\nBefore validating your AMP page, make sure you follow these best practices:\n\nIf you’re optimizing for Google, follow their guidelines for AMP pages\nLink your AMP pages to their canonicals (non-AMP version, or the AMP page itself)\nUse the same structured data markup in the AMP and canonical pages \nVerify the structure data works by using the Rich Results Test\nVerify your robots.txt file doesn’t block your AMP page\nFollow international SEO hreflang guidelines \n\nAnd when you’re ready to review, use the AMP Test Tool to make sure your page meets all requirements.\n\nFor a more detailed guide, check out AMP’s official tutorial for validating AMP pages. \n\nAnd if you’re new to web development, use AMP’s courses or Google’s AMP foundations codelab. \n\nCreate Your AMP Page With a CMS\n\nIf you manage your content through a CMS, you can use Drupal, Joomla, or WordPress. \n\nFor example, let’s see what this looks like using AMP for WP.\n\nAfter activating the plugin on WordPress, you can begin creating your Accelerated Mobile Pages.\n\nStart by adding a new page or new post.\n\nThen click “Start the AMP Page Builder.”\n\nYou can choose to use pre-built layouts or build your own using drag-and-drop elements.\n\nThen click the gear icon to edit the elements of your page.\n\nAnd save each module as you go.\n\nOnce you publish the page, you’ll see the AMP version of the page by adding “amp” to the end of your page’s URL.\n\nMonitor and Improve Your AMP Pages\n\nOne of the best ways to monitor and improve your AMP pages is to periodically audit your site. It’ll help keep track of any HTML, templating, and style and layout issues. \n\nStart by running your site through our Site Audit tool. \n\nTip: Create a free Semrush account and crawl up to 100 URLs of any domain, subdomain, or subfolder.\n\nOnce you crawl your site, head to the “Statistics” tab. You’ll see issues in the row labeled “AMP Links.” \n\nThe tool checks for over 40 of the most common errors related to AMP pages. And tells you how to fix them. \n\nResolve any issues as soon as possible. They can affect how search engines serve your content to searchers. \n\nFind and Fix AMP Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
