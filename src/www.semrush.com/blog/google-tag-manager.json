  "content": "What Is Google Tag Manager?\n\nGoogle Tag Manager (GTM) is a free tool that enables you to install, store, and manage marketing tags without modifying website code. \n\nMarketing tags are small snippets of code that track user actions and collect data. \n\nThe most common example of a marketing tag is the Google tag.\n\nThe Google tag is used to install Google Analytics and other Google products and services.\n\nOther common examples include Google Analytics events, Google Ads conversion scripts, Meta Pixel, and remarketing tags.\n\nTags like these are placed in your website code for Google Analytics and other platforms to function and collect data.\n\nBut with every code change, you risk losing or breaking tags (or other website elements).\n\nGTM mitigates these issues by allowing you to install, manage, and deploy marketing tags from within its software instead of in your website code.\n\nAnd the software injects code snippets and marketing tags into your website code only when necessary.\n\nSo you won’t accidentally break your website by testing something.\n\nWhat Is Google Tag Manager Used For?\n\nGoogle Tag Manager is used for managing and deploying marketing tags on a website without having to modify the code.\n\nThis allows you to integrate easily with other marketing tools and platforms such as:\n\nGoogle Analytics\nGoogle Ads\nFacebook\nHotjar\nCRM Platforms\n\nAnd it allows you to track almost any kind of event or user behavior you can think of.\n\nHere are some examples of commonly tracked events:\n\nLink clicks\nButton clicks\nForm submissions\nConversions\nShopping cart abandonment\nAdding items to cart\nRemoving items from cart\nFile downloads\nScroll behavior\nVideo views\nCall to action (CTA) performance\nTable of contents (TOC) clicks\nCustom events\n\nDue to its ease of use and built-in security features, GTM is also used to reduce dependency on developers and plugins. \n\nGet More of the Data & Insights You Really Need\n\nwith ImpactHero\n\nTry for Free →\nBenefits of Google Tag Manager\n\nWhile Tag Manager requires some technical knowledge, it saves marketers tons of time and resources.\n\nAnd it’s free.\n\nHere are some benefits:\n\nReduced reliance on developers: Quickly and simply add and manage marketing tags without developer assistance\nTesting and debugging: Preview, test, and debug changes before pushing them to a live site. This feature helps prevent errors and reduces the need for testing on a live or staging site. \nUser permission control: Only authorized people can make or approve changes to your marketing setup\nVersions: GTM creates and logs a new version of the code whenever you publish changes. This allows you to view past and present changes and revert to previous versions if necessary. \nWorkspaces: GTM enables multiple workspaces for team members to work simultaneously without overwriting each other’s progress\nEasy configuration of many popular tools: Easily add tools and tracking tags to your website code using code snippets or existing templates (e.g., for Google Analytics, Pinterest, Google Ads, etc.) from the Community Template Gallery\nTag storage and management: Google Tag Manager consolidates marketing tags and tracking codes in one place and injects them into website code as needed. Which allows you to add, remove, and update tools and tracking codes with fewer errors.\nShould You Use Google Tag Manager?\n\nYes, you should probably use Google Tag Manager.\n\nEven if you are not super technical or have limited resources available. \n\nGTM is great for adding, managing, and editing website tracking and analytics codes.\n\nAnd it saves time and resources by allowing you to do these things without changing your site’s source code.\n\nThis eases the burden on development resources.\n\nAnd reduces the likelihood of site-breaking errors.\n\nHowever, GTM is a complex tool that comes with a steep learning curve.\n\nAnd setting it up correctly is critical. \n\nBut once it’s set up and you’ve learned to use Tag Manager properly, you’ll kick yourself for not doing it sooner.\n\nHow Does Google Tag Manager Work?\n\nGoogle Tag Manager works by using a single JavaScript code snippet that you add to your site as a container for all the tags you want to manage.\n\nIt has listeners that detect user interactions, such as page views.\n\nWhen a user loads a page, the GTM listeners detect the action.\n\nThen they check if the action matches any triggers that have been set up in GTM.\n\nIf the interaction matches a trigger, the associated tag is fired. \n\nThe tag could be a code snippet for Google Analytics or other marketing platform.\n\nOr it could be a specific event you want to track (e.g., views of a certain page). \n\nWhen the tag is fired, the code is injected into the website.\n\nThen the tag processes the relevant data and sends it to the respective third-party service (e.g., Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel).\n\nIn other words, GTM only injects and executes a tag when a user triggers one.\n\nThis reduces the overall amount of code on a website and minimizes the risk of implementation errors.\n\nTags can only function along with other GTM components called triggers and variables.\n\nThey help to determine when to execute the code snippets.\n\nTags\n\nTags are snippets of code that analytics, marketing, and support platforms use to integrate with sites and apps.\n\nThey are like observers you put on your website.\n\nThey keep track of what users do, like click links or view pages. \n\nAnd they send this information to tools like Google Analytics or ImpactHero.\n\nTags ultimately help you understand user behavior.\n\nExamples of Tags\n\nThe following are examples of commonly used tags. These are tools and platforms often installed with GTM:\n\nGoogle Analytics\nGoogle Ads\nCrazy Egg\nHotjar\nImpactHero\nPinterest Tag\nLinkedIn Insight\nTwitter Universal Web Tag\nFacebook/Meta Pixel\nSplitSignal\nAppcues\nHubSpot\nIntercom\nMixpanel\nSalesforce\nCustom events and tracking\nTriggers\n\nTriggers are instructions and criteria for when tags should fire.\n\nPage views, form submissions, and link clicks are common examples of triggers.\n\nWhen a user views a page or clicks a link, the associated tag will fire.\n\nEvery tag must have at least one trigger so GTM knows under which circumstances to fire the tag. \n\nAnalytics platforms like Google Analytics typically use page views as a trigger.\n\nThis is because you want analytics data from every page a user visits.\n\nAlternatively, you might only want a conversion tracking tag to fire when a user places an item in their cart.\n\nOr perhaps when they complete the checkout process. \n\nWhen each tag’s specified event occurs, its trigger tells the tag to fire.\n\nOtherwise, the tag will not fire.\n\nAnd GTM won’t execute the code snippet.\n\nYou can also add variables to triggers to further specify when you want tags to fire.\n\nFor example, you may only want your support chat to fire on pages in the checkout funnel.\n\nIn this case, you could add a variable telling the tag to only fire on page views of pages with “/checkout/” in the URL. \n\nYou can assign multiple triggers to a single tag.\n\nExamples of Triggers\n\nHere are some of the most commonly used triggers:\n\nPage views\nLink clicks\nButton clicks\nForm submissions\nFile downloads\nScroll depth\nTime spent on page\nCustom event \nVariables\n\nVariables are additional pieces of information GTM may need to fire a tag or trigger.\n\nThey help define precisely what the tag or trigger is supposed to do.\n\nFor example, “Constant” and “Google Analytics Settings” are common types of variables.\n\nThey are both typically used to define Google Analytics account IDs (i.e., “Tracking ID” in Universal Analytics and “Measurement ID” or “Google Tag” in GA4).\n\nEvery time you create a Google Analytics tag, you need to enter your tracking or measurement ID. \n\nThis can get tedious, as most of us don’t memorize these IDs.\n\nInstead, you can create a variable that simply stores your ID.\n\nThen, whenever you create a new tag that requires this information, you simply attach the variable you created.\n\nAnother common variable is “Page URL.”\n\nIf you wanted to track page views of your checkout page, you’d have to assign the “Page Views” trigger.\n\nBut to specify the checkout page, you’d have to assign the Page URL variable and add the URL for your checkout page.\n\nExamples of Variables\n\nThe following are some of the most common variables:\n\nConstant\nGoogle Analytics Settings\nClick URL\nClick ID\nClick Class\nPage URL\nPage Path\nForm ID\nScroll depth threshold\n\nGet More of the Data & Insights You Really Need\n\nwith ImpactHero\n\nTry for Free →\nGoogle Tag Manager vs. Google Analytics\n\nThough often conflated, Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics are different tools you can use together to collect and report on web analytics and user behavior. \n\nGoogle Tag Manager is a tag management system that stores and manages marketing tags and third-party code snippets.\n\nThere are no analytics or reports in Tag Manager.\n\nGoogle Analytics, on the other hand, is software used for analytics, conversion tracking, and reporting.\n\nYou can use GTM to install and deploy Google Analytics on a website. (Google recommends doing this.)\n\nDo You Need to Change Anything for Google Analytics 4?\n\nYes. If you are using GTM to install Google Analytics 4 (GA4), you’ll need to install the Google Tag.\n\nAside from that, using Google Tag Manager with GA4 is very similar to using it with Universal Analytics (UA).\n\nOne of the main differences is that Google now provides a separate tag for GA4 events.\n\nPreviously, you’d implement UA and track events using the same tag. \n\nAnother difference is that GA4 can automatically track and collect many more events than UA on its own.\n\nWhich means less need for manual event tracking in GTM.\n\nHowever, you can still use GTM to track anything GA4 doesn’t provide.\n\nTag Manager and GA4 work seamlessly together. \n\nRead Google’s guide on moving from UA to GA4 for additional information.\n\nHow to Set Up Google Tag Manager\n\nTo set up Google Tag Manager, log in to your Google account and go to Tag Manager.\n\nClick “Create Account” to create an account for your business or organization.\n\nEnter an “Account Name” and select your country.\n\nGoogle recommends that each business create only one account—whether you have one website or multiple.\n\nYour company name can serve as your account name.\n\nNext, enter a “Container name.” \n\nYour container is the piece of code you will add to your website to make Google Tag Manager work.\n\nYou will typically use one container per website.\n\nSo your container name can be your website name or URL.\n\nThen, select your “Target platform.” For websites, choose “Web.”\n\nClick “Create” to make your Tag Manager account and your first container. \n\nNext, you’ll see two pop-ups. \n\nThe first is the Google terms of service.\n\nAgree to the terms by checking the box at the bottom of the page. \n\nAnd click “Yes” to accept at the top right corner of your screen.\n\nThe second pop-up displays the code snippets you need to add to your site to install GTM.\n\nNote\n\nIf you’re not comfortable modifying your website code, ask a developer for assistance.\n\nThe first code snippet uses JavaScript to extract information.\n\nPlace that snippet as high in the <head> section of your website pages as possible.\n\nThe second snippet is an HTML iframe.\n\nPlace that code immediately after the opening <body> tag on your webpages.\n\nLike this:\n\n(The HTML iframe element ensures that GTM still works when users disable JavaScript in their browsers.) \n\nOnce you’ve set up your account and properly installed the two code snippets, you’re ready to start using Google Tag Manager. \n\nPro tip\n\nUse the Tag Assistant Legacy extension to ensure your Tag Manager implementation is correct.\n\nGet More of the Data & Insights You Really Need\n\nwith ImpactHero\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Use Google Tag Manager\n\nTo demonstrate how to use Google Tag Manager, we’ll walk you through how to connect a Google Analytics 4 property to your site.\n\nPro tip\n\nTo prevent your analytics from registering double hits, ensure you’ve installed Google Tag Manager and have removed the original Google Analytics code from your website before proceeding.\n\nBegin by logging in to your Google Tag Manager account.\n\nClick “New Tag” or “Add a new tag” to create a new tag.\n\nAdd a name for your tag. We suggest something like “GA4 Configuration.”\n\nNext, click on “Tag Configuration.”\n\nClick “Google Analytics.”\n\nAnd select “Google Tag” from the list.\n\nEnter the Google tag ID for your GA4 property.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a variable to store your Google tag ID for future use.\n\nClick the “Triggering” box.\n\nAnd select “All Pages” from the list that pops up.\n\nThen click “Save.”\n\nGo back to your workspace overview page and click “Preview” to test your new changes.\n\nEnter your website’s URL in the next screen.\n\nThen click “Connect” to open your site in a new window and begin testing and debugging.\n\nOnce you’re connected, your site should open in a new pop-up.\n\nWith the Tag Assistant in the lower right corner of your window.\n\nKeep that window open and return to the preview page.\n\nThe preview page should say, “Connected!”\n\nAfter you hit “Continue,” start debugging your tags in the preview window.\n\nYou should see your newly created GA4 Configuration tag firing on each page as you navigate your website.\n\nThis means your tag implementation was successful.\n\nWhen you’re done debugging, close the newly opened windows and go back to your page overview.\n\nThen click “Submit” to submit your changes.\n\nBe sure to give your changes a descriptive “Version Name” and “Version Description.”\n\nLastly, click “Publish” to push your changes to your live website and enable GA4.\n\nThis will publish a new version of your container to your website.\n\nYou should now see hits registering in the “Realtime” report of your GA4 property as you and other users navigate the website.\n\nPro tip\n\nWe strongly recommend always using the “Preview” function to test and debug your tags before you publish them.\n\nBest GTM Extensions\n\nBrowser extensions help you get more out of Tag Manager. \n\nThe following extensions provide additional information on the tags that are firing (or not firing).\n\nAnd any issues that arise with your implementations.\n\nThey also provide important details regarding your variables, triggers, and code snippets. \n\nThe following extensions are some of the best for facilitating your GTM efforts:\n\nTag Assistant\nGTM/GA Debugger\nDataslayer\nDataLayer Inspector+\nDa Vinci Tools\nTrack Even More Data\n\nGoogle Tag Manager allows you to track almost any user behavior or interaction you can think of.\n\nAnd GA4 comes with a lot of valuable user data right out of the box.\n\nBut simple page metrics and events can only tell you what happened. \n\nImpactHero goes beyond that and tells you why something happened.\n\nAnd what you need to do to improve it. \n\nFrom customer journey mapping to content performance analysis, ImpactHero provides the marketing data you really need to be successful.\n\nGet More of the Data & Insights You Really Need\n\nwith ImpactHero\n\nTry for Free →",
