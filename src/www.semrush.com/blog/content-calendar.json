  "content": "What Is a Content Calendar?\n\nA content calendar (also called an editorial calendar) is a schedule of when and where you'll publish your upcoming content. It helps you manage your content creation and publication process.\n\nYou can use a content calendar for blog content, social media posts, email campaigns, videos, and more. \n\nAnd it might also include fields for:\n\nTitles\nPublication dates\nTeam members involved\nStatuses\n\nHere's an example of what a basic content calendar might look like:\n\nDownload our free content calendar template to get started.\n\nWhy Are Content Calendars Important?\n\nContent calendars streamline your content creation and publication process. To ensure you know what stage each piece is at, what’s coming up next, and whether you need to adjust for any delays. \n\nHere are some more specific ways a content calendar can benefit you:\n\nConsistency: It ensures regular content publication. Which helps you maintain a steady content flow that can keep your audience engaged.\nCollaboration: It creates a central reference point for all content-related tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities. Which can streamline communication.\nResource management: It allows you to allocate time and team members appropriately. So you can balance workloads.\nContent diversity: With a calendar, you can incorporate a mix of content types and topics. To appeal to different audience preferences and cover your subject area comprehensively.\nHow to Create a Content Calendar\n\nBelow, we’ll walk you through how to build a calendar that allows you to effectively plan and publish your content.\n\nLet’s break down the process into a few steps:\n\n1. Choose a Calendar Tool\n\nFirst, think carefully about what tool you want to use for building and maintaining your content calendar. Because you want to ensure it works well for your team. \n\nYou have two main options:\n\nSpreadsheets\nSpecialized software\n\nEach has its pros and cons.\n\nSpreadsheets\n\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\t\n\nCons\n\n\n\n\nEasy to use and customize\n\n\t\n\nLimited collaboration features\n\n\n\n\nFree or low cost\n\n\t\n\nRequires a lot of manual updates\n\n\n\n\nFamiliar to most users\n\n\t\n\nQuickly becomes cluttered\n\n\n\n\nEasy to export data\n\n\t\n\nLacks visual calendar views (unless you create one separately)\n\n\n\n\nFlexible formatting options\n\n\t\n\nMistakes (like deletions) can be common\n\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\t\n\nCons\n\n\n\n\nGreat for team collaboration\n\n\t\n\nPotentially costly\n\n\n\n\nIncludes task assignment features\n\n\t\n\nSteeper learning curve\n\n\n\n\nVisual organization (like kanban boards)\n\n\t\n\nUnnecessary features that get in the way\n\n\n\n\nIntegrates with other work tools\n\n\t\n\nLimited customization for content-specific needs\n\n\n\n\nAutomated workflows and reminders\n\n\t\n\nOutages can halt production\n\nPick the tool that works best for your team size, budget, and content needs. \n\nHere are a few other tips to help you decide:\n\nLook for integrations. For example, if you use a message platform for communication, choose a tool that connects with it.\nEnsure it fits your workflow. If you need an approval process, pick a tool with built-in review features.\nTest before you commit. Most project management tools offer free trials—use them.\nGet your team's input. The tool should be user-friendly for everyone.\n\nRemember, you can always switch to something different as your needs change over time.\n\nWe’ll discuss a handful of different tools in detail later in this article. \n\n2. Customize Your Calendar\n\nRegardless of the tool you picked, make adjustments based on your specific needs and requirements. To ensure it’s as useful as possible.\n\nFor example, these are essential fields for any calendar:\n\nPublish date: When your content goes live\nDue date: Internal deadline for content completion\nOwner: Team member responsible for the content\nStatus: Current stage of content (e.g., in progress, approval pending, etc.)\nTitle or topic: What your content is about\nContent type: Format of your content (e.g., blog post, video, podcast, etc.)\nLink to files: Where to find drafts or final versions\n\nDepending on your content types, you might need additional fields. For example:\n\nFor blog posts:\n\nPrimary keyword (+ search volume)\nSecondary keywords (+ search volume)\nURL slug\nTitle and meta description\nFeatured image\n\nFor podcasts:\n\nLink to script\nInterviewee information\nOriginal audio files\nEdited audio files\n\nFor videos: \n\nLink to script\nInterviewee information\nCaptions\nOriginal video files\nEdited video files\nThumbnail\n\nOnce you have your content calendar set up, it’s time to populate it.\n\n3. Generate Content Ideas\n\nYou now need to brainstorm content ideas that align with your audience's interests and your business. So you can fill out your content calendar.\n\nJot down a list of broad topics related to your niche. So you can conduct keyword research.\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool for this.\n\nEnter one of your topic ideas, select your target country, and click \"Search.\"\n\nYou’ll see a list of keyword ideas with data points like search volume, keyword difficulty (how hard it is to rank for a given term), and search intent (the reason behind the query).\n\nLook for keywords that are particularly relevant to your niche. The subtopic groups on the left are helpful for this.\n\nIt’s also a good idea to use the “Questions” tab to see question-based keywords. Which are often informational terms that can be great for building content around.\n\nJot down the ideas you want to cover, repeat the process for other topics, and then determine how you want to cover each. \n\nSome may work best for blog posts. While others may be a better fit for something else.\n\nWhen it comes to social posts, you may be able to create multiple posts from a single idea.\n\nAlso, don't forget that not everything has to be completely new. You might have existing content on these topics that can be improved. \n\nNext, we recommend identifying any gaps in your planned content using the Topic Research tool.\n\nGo to the tool, enter one of your topics and choose your target location.\n\nThen, use the “+ Enter domain to find content on” to enter a competitor’s URL and click “Get content ideas.”\n\nYou’ll see different cards on related subtopics. \n\nClick on any card to see:\n\nVolume: How many times this subtopic is searched each month\nQuestions: Related things users ask about\nHeadlines: Titles of existing articles on this topic\n\nMake note of any cards highlighted in green. Because that indicates a subtopic your competitor is ranking for. Meaning it’s likely a good idea for you to include in your content plans.\n\nAgain, think of how you want to cover each subtopic.\n\nOnce you’ve brainstormed, add relevant ideas to your content calendar. And include a working title, the content type, etc.\n\nFurther reading: Content Planning: How to Create a Content Plan, Step by Step\n\nDo Keyword Research & Find Content Ideas\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Schedule Your Content\n\nDetermine how often you'll publish each type of content. To ensure consistent publication and content variety without overburdening your team.\n\nStart with a realistic schedule you know you can maintain. Because it's better to publish high-quality content less frequently than to rush out subpar pieces just to meet deadlines.\n\nThen, populate your calendar accordingly.\n\nAnd be prepared to adjust your schedule as you learn what works best.\n\n5. Share the Calendar with Your Team\n\nYou’re now ready to invite colleagues and collaborators to your calendar. So you can start streamlining your content processes.\n\nMost project management software allows you to assign users as “Owners” of a task. And they receive a notification when the status of the task changes in some way. \n\nAnd spreadsheets can be shared easily. To do this in a Google Sheet, just click the “Share” button at the top right corner to add team members.\n\nIt’s also a good idea to schedule a meeting to walk through it. So everyone knows their role and how to use the calendar.\n\nFor example, writers should know how to mark when they've completed a draft. And editors should understand how to indicate when they've reviewed a piece.\n\nBe patient and ask for feedback. You can always adjust your process to make it work better for everyone.\n\nThe Best Content Calendar Tools (+ Templates)\n\nHere are our favorite content calendar tools, arranged by business size:\n\nFor solo marketers or small teams with limited budgets:\n\nGoogle Sheets (can use our calendar template)\nWordPress Editorial Calendar\n\nFor larger businesses with a team of content creators:\n\nTrello (comes with a template)\nNotion (comes with a template)\nAsana (comes with a template)\n\nLet’s review each one. \n\nGoogle Sheets\n\nGoogle Sheets is a free, cloud-based spreadsheet app. It's a great starting point for creating your content calendar because nearly everyone is familiar with it.\n\nThis is what a content calendar built with Google Sheets looks like:\n\nGoogle Sheets works well for beginners and solo marketers. It's easy to use and allows basic collaboration.\n\nBut as your content production scales up, you might need more robust project management tools.\n\nDownload our Google Sheets content calendar template. \n\nWordPress Editorial Calendar \n\nThe WordPress Editorial Calendar is a free plugin that helps you manage your blog content. \n\nIt’s a simple but effective plugin. \n\nIt generates a calendar that shows all your articles (draft, scheduled, etc.).\n\nYou can edit or delete posts from the calendar. And use the drag-and-drop feature to easily make changes. \n\nThis plugin helps you schedule your blog posts, but it doesn’t offer any collaboration options. \n\nTo try this plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard and go to “Plugins” > “Add New Plugin.” \n\nSearch “Editorial Calendar” and start the installation.\n\nTrello \n\nTrello allows you to create and manage kanban boards. Which let you visualize your progress in one place. \n\nIt looks like this: \n\nAs you work on a task, you use Trello’s drag-and-drop features to change it to a different status (column). \n\nYou can start with this content calendar template from Trello. \n\nTrello also allows you to visualize your kanban board as a calendar. (But you’ll need to pay for a Premium account.) \n\nNotion\n\nNotion allows you to create a tailor-made content calendar and configure different views for it. \n\nNotion stands out because it’s highly customizable.\n\nIt takes a bit of getting used to, but you may find it to be a helpful tool. \n\nNotion has several ready-to-use content calendar templates. You can start with this basic option.\n\nAsana\n\nAsana is a project management tool that’s good for bigger teams with complex processes. \n\nThis is what the calendar view looks like: \n\nWith Asana, you can create and assign tasks, visualize your progress using different views, and manage your workflows.\n\nIt also offers integrations with some of the most popular tools. Like Slack, Gmail, and Zoom.\n\nYou can get started with their basic editorial framework.\n\nThe Strategy Behind Your Content Calendar\n\nYour content calendar helps you execute your content strategy. \n\nHere are the strategy basics that will inform all your content creation and distribution efforts:\n\nUnderstand Your Target Audience\n\nBefore you start creating content, you must understand your target audience and define your buyer personas (detailed profiles of your potential customers).\n\nThis is key for creating quality content that drives results. \n\nBy defining your buyer personas, you can decide on:\n\nThe topics you’ll talk about\nThe content formats you’ll use\nThe platforms you’ll be on\n\nTip\n\nYou might have multiple personas, but it's better to prioritize content for the one with the greatest potential. This means focusing first on content for audiences with higher content marketing return on investment (ROI). \n\nHow do you perform audience research?\n\nYou can do the following:\n\nTalk to employees in your organization who are in touch with customers (though keep in mind this will yield information about current customers—they aren’t necessarily the same as your target audience)\nRead industry reports\nStudy your competitors\n\nOne2Target is especially helpful for getting to know your potential customers based on one or more competitors. \n\nStart by entering your competitors’ domains. (You can add up to five.) And click “Analyze.”\n\nYou’ll see a dashboard with in-depth information about the collective audience (demographics, socioeconomic information, behavior, and more).\n\nThis is a great way to understand your audience and plan content that fits their needs. \n\nYou can even see which social media platforms they prefer.\n\nRead our in-depth guide to finding your target audience for more details.\n\nLearn About Your Target Audience\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\nPerform a Content Audit\n\nConducting a content audit means analyzing the performance of your content. \n\nIt will help you understand the following: \n\nThe types of content that work best. Analyze these to create similar ones in the future.\nThe content pieces that are outdated. You can improve them or delete them. \n\nIt’s helpful to audit all types of content: blog posts, YouTube videos, podcasts, and more.\n\nAfter conducting a content audit, you can start filling out your content calendar with new content pieces. Or content pieces that need improvement.\n\nPlus, an audit can give you a baseline understanding of your overall performance. Which helps you set goals for what you want to achieve.\n\nSet Clear Goals\n\nHaving clear goals provides direction that can drive your content strategy's success. And they should align with your larger business goals to ensure organizational alignment. \n\nWe recommend that your goals be SMART:\n\nSpecific\nMeasurable\nActionable\nRelevant \nTime-bound\n\nLet’s say you’re going to focus mostly on long-form blog articles based on your audience’s interest in publishing and media. That your audit revealed your current blog content gets 800 organic visits per month. And that one of your business’s main goals is to increase leads by 5% in the next year.\n\nAn example of a SMART goal for your content would be: Publish 40 new blog posts and increase organic traffic by 20% over the next year. \n\nYou can also come up with more granular goals for each content type. \n\nThis ensures every piece serves a purpose. Allowing you to track progress and adjust your strategy as needed. \n\nDefine How and When You’ll Measure Results\n\nFinally, determine what your key performance metrics (KPIs) are and how often you’ll track your performance. So you can see how you’re tracking toward your goals.\n\nThis will largely be informed by your goals.\n\nIf you’re aiming to publish 40 new blog posts and increase organic traffic by 20%, that means both the number of published posts and organic traffic are KPIs.\n\nBut you might want to include others as well. Like keyword rankings.\n\nIt’s also important to determine how frequently you want to measure results. \n\nThis can vary, but you might want to do this on a monthly or even weekly basis. \n\nFurther reading: Content Performance: 19 Metrics to Track Your Results\n\nStart Filling Out Your Content Calendar\n\nAs you can see, a content calendar is a simple tool for managing everyday content-related tasks. \n\nBut it’s also powerful. Because it can keep you on track. So you’re more likely to reach your goals. \n\nReady to begin?\n\nStart your audience research with One2Target.
