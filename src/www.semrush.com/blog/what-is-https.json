  "content": "What Is HTTPS?\n\nHypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is an encrypted version of HTTP. Which is the protocol used to transfer data between web browsers (like Chrome) and servers (computers that host websites).\n\nWhen you visit a website that uses HTTPS, the connection between your browser and the website's server is encrypted (meaning it’s scrambled)\n\nThis protects your data from being spied on by attackers.\n\nThat data includes all types of confidential information—login credentials, payment information, and browsing activity in general.\n\nSo, in other words:\n\nThe HTTPS protocol is fundamental for keeping your data private and secure when surfing the web.\n\nBut how does it work, exactly? And how is it different from HTTP?\n\nLet’s find out.\n\nPro tip\n\nCheck your website for HTTPS issues with Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nCheck for HTTPS-Related Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow Does HTTPS Work?\n\nHTTPS works on a request-response model (meaning the browser sends a request and the server responds to that request), just like in HTTP. \n\nBut HTTPS uses a secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS) certificate for encryption. (These are digital documents that prove the identity of a website. So an encrypted connection can be established.)\n\nHere’s how the entire process works:\n\n1. Browser contacts website: The user's web browser attempts to connect to a website using HTTPS\n\n2. SSL certificate sends: The website's server responds by sending its SSL/TLS certificate to the browser. This certificate contains the website’s public key (encryption key) and is used to establish a secure connection.\n\n3. Browser verifies certificate: The browser checks the certificate to ensure it’s valid and is issued by a trusted certificate authority (like GoDaddy, DigiCert, Comodo, etc.). This step is crucial for confirming a website’s authenticity.\n\n4. Encryption key exchange: The browser and the server establish an encrypted connection by exchanging keys once the certificate is verified. The browser uses the server's public key to encrypt information, which can only be decrypted by the private key (i.e., the decryption key) the server holds.\n\n5. Encrypted data transfer: All data transferred between the browser and the server is encrypted after the secure connection is established. Which ensures it can’t be read by anyone intercepting the data.\n\n6. Data decryption and display: The server decrypts the received data using the private key, processes it, and sends back the requested information. This data is also encrypted. The browser then decrypts the incoming data and displays the website content to the user.\n\nHTTP vs. HTTPS\n\nNow that you know how HTTPS works, let’s quickly go over how it’s different from HTTP.\n\nHTTP works differently from HTTPS on several different levels:\n\nEncryption\n\nHTTP transfers data as plain text. This means anyone can easily intercept and read it.\n\nHTTPS, on the other hand, leverages encryption to shield the data. So the information remains unintelligible and secure, even if it’s intercepted.\n\nThis means hackers would only see a scrambled sequence of characters rather than the actual information.\n\nThis is the main distinguishing factor between HTTP and HTTPS.\n\nPorts\n\nPorts are like virtual doors information travels through between a browser and a website server. And each port is assigned a number.\n\nBoth HTTP and HTTPS use standard ports to facilitate communication.\n\nHTTP typically uses port 80 as its default—this was established early in the development of the web for sending and receiving content.\n\nHTTPS uses port 443. Which is reserved for encrypted traffic.\n\nURL Format\n\nA uniform resource locator (URL) serves as the address for locating resources on the internet. And it’s formatted slightly differently for HTTP and HTTPS. \n\nHTTPS URLs begin with “https://.” Which indicates a secure connection. \n\nBut HTTP URLs start with “http://.” And the missing “s” signifies the absence of security.\n\nSSL/TLS Certificate\n\nKeep in mind what we said earlier about how an SSL/TLS certificate is a digital document that proves a website’s identity and authenticity.\n\nThis added level of verification is only used in HTTPS communication—not in traditional HTTP communication.\n\nFurther reading: HTTP vs. HTTPS: What’s the Difference?\n\nAdvantages of HTTPS\n\nWe’ve covered some of the benefits of HTTPS already, but here’s a quick refresher in case you need reminding (plus, some additional benefits):\n\nEnhanced Data Privacy\n\nHTTPS protects users’ privacy. So their sensitive information (such as credit card numbers or login details) remains confidential and inaccessible to hackers.\n\nCompare that to HTTP. Where the data is sent in clear text and can be easily intercepted. Which leaves users’ privacy at risk.\n\nThey’re vulnerable to attacks like man-in-the-middle, packet sniffing, and session hijacking.\n\nThe encryption used in HTTPS connections prevents these attacks by fully securing data that flows between a browser and a website’s server.\n\nEnhanced User Experience\n\nHTTPS positively impacts the user experience because it fosters a sense of trust in users when they’re browsing, shopping, or sharing information online.\n\nUsers are becoming increasingly aware that they should look for the padlock symbol to confirm whether a website is safe\n\nThis means that websites using HTTPS could be more likely to retain visitors, reduce their bounce rates, and potentially increase conversion rates (as users feel more comfortable making transactions).\n\nBetter SEO Rankings\n\nHTTPS can boost your website’s ranking and visibility on search engines like Google.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Google uses HTTPS as a ranking signal. This means websites that use HTTPS are more likely to appear higher on search engine results pages (SERPs), attracting more organic traffic and potential customers.\n\nIf you’re serious about SEO, check your website for HTTPS issues. Which are common among sites that have recently migrated from HTTP to HTTPS.\n\nThese issues include:\n\nInternal links (links on your pages that point to other pages on your site) that haven’t been updated to HTTPS (after migration)\nMixed content issues where other resources on a webpage (such as images and CSS files) are still being served over HTTP\nA mismatch between the name your SSL/TLS certificate is registered under and the name displayed in the browser’s address bar\n\nAnd more.\n\nYou can check your site for all these issues using Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your website URL, and click “Start Audit.”\n\nThe tool will prompt you to set up a project. After everything is configured, it’ll start auditing your site.\n\nOnce the audit is complete, go to the “HTTPS” section under the “Thematics Reports” module in the “Overview” tab.\n\nAnd click on the “View details” button.\n\nYou’ll see how your site is doing across multiple HTTPS-related issues.\n\nIssues are highlighted with the exclamation mark symbol and the orange outline. \n\nYou can also learn more about a particular issue by clicking on the “Learn more” link or the “Why and how to fix it” link under each item.\n\nFrom there, you can learn how to fix any specific issues.\n\nFind & Fix HTTPS-Related Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nNow, back to the benefits of HTTPS.\n\nCompatibility with Browsers\n\nMajor browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari have supported HTTPS encryption and the key security protocols involved for many years now.\n\nSo, there’s no need to worry about your website visitors not being able to access an HTTPS site—unless they’re using extremely outdated software. Which virtually no one does.\n\nFAQs\n\nTo wrap things up, we’ll cover some frequently asked questions about HTTPS.\n\nWhat Does HTTPS Stand For?\n\nHTTPS stands for hypertext transfer protocol secure. It's the secure, encrypted version of the standard HTTP web protocol.\n\nIs HTTPS Better Than HTTP?\n\nHTTPS is far superior to regular, unencrypted HTTP. \n\nHTTPS connections are encrypted through SSL/TLS certificates. This means HTTPS ensures visitors connect to the real website and that their data is secure from hackers.\n\nHTTP has no encryption at all. So, it leaves websites and visitors vulnerable to attacks.\n\nWhat Does the ‘S’ in HTTPS Stand For?\n\nThe \"S\" in HTTPS stands for secure. It differentiates the encrypted HTTPS protocol from regular, unencrypted HTTP communication.\n\nWhat Port Does HTTPS Use?\n\nHTTPS uses port 443 by default instead of HTTP's port 80. \n\nPort 443 lets you access websites securely with encryption.\n\nHow Do You Know if Your Site Uses HTTPS?\n\nTo confirm that your site is running on HTTPS, click on the tune icon next to the URL in the browser’s address bar and look for the padlock sign. And ensure the URL begins with “https://” rather than “http://.”\n\nAdditionally, modern browsers may provide a “Not secure” warning if a site is served over HTTP.\n\nHow Do You Check for HTTPS-Related Issues?\n\nThere are multiple tools that can help you find HTTPS-related issues on your website.\n\nOne option is Site Audit. It checks your site for 11 different HTTPS-related issues. And presents the results in a report like this:\n\nCheck for HTTPS-Related Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nNext Steps\n\nNow that you know what HTTPS is, how it works, and what benefits it offers, you might be wondering what to do next.\n\nTry expanding your knowledge about HTTPS with these resources:\n\nHow to Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (+ Best Practices)\nA Complete Guide to Redirects",
