It'll trigger the tool to conduct an in-depth analysis of your top organic rivals.\n\nNext, click “Create article” and get an entire article in a few minutes. \n\nHaving created a powerful base for your article, head to the user-friendly blog editor and make changes directly in the article (or using the AI chat). \n\nYou can also check organic competitive insights and generate AI images for free.\n\nFinally, the Improvement tab lets you fine-tune readability, tone of voice, and SEO. \n\nIt displays a score to help you optimize your content on the go and avoid potential ranking and engagement roadblocks. \n\nPros and Cons\n\n🔥 Pros\n\n\t\n\n🤔 Cons\n\n\n\nSimple yet highly functional interface suitable for beginners\nUses Semrush’s real-time competitive data to help you rank in search\nReplaces all other content creation tools for ideation, research, writing, and management\nCreates content with up-to-date, fresh information\n\t\nLimited to content marketing: blog posts, articles, and social posts\nCurrently, it’s only available in English \nMight be limiting for large enterprise teams with numerous team members\nPricing\nYou can explore the tool with a 7-day free trial.\nAfter that, get the Unlimited Plan for $60/month and create as much content as you want.\nFinal Verdict: Is ContentShake AI Worth the Hype?\n\nIf you want to create engaging and SEO-optimized content for your business or agency, then ContentShake AI is worth it. \n\nHowever, as ContentShake AI is built for small and medium businesses, it may not suit larger enterprises looking to automate their entire content production.\n\n2. Jasper.ai: Best AI Writing Tool for Enterprise Team\n\nJasper AI - an AI writing software for enterprise teams Select an Image\n\nJasper AI is one of the industry’s best-known AI writing tools. \n\nWith 50+ content templates, Jasper AI is designed to help enterprise marketers overcome writer's block. \n\nIt’s relatively easy to use: choose a template, provide context, and set parameters, so the tool can write according to your style and tone of voice.\n\nKey Features\nCreates content based on your writing style and brand tone of voice\nGenerates images with Stable Diffusion\nTurns a single brief into a multi-channel marketing campaign\nOffers a vast library of predefined templates for various content formats\nJasper User Experience \n\nJasper offers a 7-day free trial to test any selected plan. \n\nThe Blog Post workflow is one of Jasper's most popular features. We tested its ability to produce human-like content by asking it to write a blog post on ‘How to decorate a room like an interior designer.’ \n\nFirst, you’ll need to input lots of details to generate your article.\n\nFor example, the tool asks you to specify the target audience, the outline, and the target keywords. \n\nYou can use its AI suggestions, although they’re not based on real-time data.\n\nJasper AI generated a decent piece of content with many bullet points. While it was not optimized for search intent, it could still be useful as a starting point.\n\nHowever, the blog post wasn’t in-depth and looked more like an outline. The tone of voice was rather neutral—even somewhat robotic.\n\nPros and Cons\n\n🔥 Pros\n\n\t\n\n🤔 Cons\n\n\n\n\nQuickly generates different types of content for various channels (from social media posts to product descriptions)\n\nOffers the Jasper Brand Voice feature\n\nGenerates AI images (with a separate tool)\n\n\t\n\nLimited capabilities for SEO optimization and long-form content \n\nNo AI image generation directly in the content editor\n\nMight not be suitable for small teams and beginners without deep SEO and content marketing expertise\n\nPricing\nJasper “Creator” costs $49/month (one seat). \nJasper “Pro,” which allows up to five users, costs $69/month/seat. \nFor the Business plan pricing, you’ll need to contact the sales department.\nFinal Verdict: Is Jasper AI Worth the Hype?\n\nJasper's output for long-form content is not perfect and not optimized for SEO. However, it’s an awesome tool for creating content outlines and generating short-form copy at scale.\n\n3. Copy.ai: AI Content Tool for Marketing and Sales Automation\n\nCopy.ai shares several similarities with Jasper. They both offer content creation features, cater to the enterprise audience, and are powered by AI. \n\nHowever, Copy.ai is designed to work with various AI models like GPT 3.5, GPT 4, Azure, and Anthropic, which makes it more flexible for delivering high-quality results. \n\nAnd, the tool’s main use case is automating various marketing and sales workflows. \n\nThis makes it somewhat different from the rest of this list, but it might come in handy if you’re part of a large marketing or sales team.\n\nKey Features\nOver 100+ copywriting templates and tools\nAn AI-powered language translator which supports 25+ languages\nA robust AI marketing and sales automation platform\nTools to design your own workflows and complete tasks faster\nCopy.ai User Experience \n\nCopy.ai offers a 14-day trial to test its features. \n\nOn the dashboard, you can access AI tools, automation features, and the Assets library. \n\nSelecting the Chat option opens a search field where you can interact with CopyAI’s chatbot like you would with ChatGPT. \n\nHowever, the chat functionality is not connected to the blog editor.\n\nThe main application of Copy.ai is creating workflows. Here’s how it works:\n\nSelect the type of project you want to work on\nProvide the tool with a comprehensive prompt\nGet multiple results, using a range of copywriting frameworks\nPick the best, copy it to the editor, and polish it up for posting \n\nWe tested this feature with a detailed brief for creating a LinkedIn post. \n\nIn less than 1 minute, Copy.ai generated 8 comprehensive LinkedIn posts using 8 different copywriting frameworks. \n\nBe aware that advanced automation workflows for sales, marketing, and demand generation teams are more complex and require a step-by-step setup.\n\nPros and Cons\n\n🔥 Pros\n\n\t\n\n🤔 Cons\n\n\n\n\nPowerful tools that large marketing and sales teams can use\n\nSaves time and resources when you need to scale content production\n\nOffers numerous integrations\n\n\t\n\nMight be complicated to set up and takes time to understand\n\nNot well adapted for the needs of smaller teams and individual creators\n\nRequires additional tools for SEO optimization\n\nPricing\nUse Copy.ai with limited words (and other limited capabilities) for free. \nThe Pro plan costs $36/month, and the Team plan comes at $186/month.\nFinal Verdict: Is CopyAI Worth the Hype?\n\nCopy.ai can do wonders for large teams looking to create complex workflows and generate AI content at scale. However, it’s not optimized for SEO-friendly content creation and might come off as too complicated for beginners and smaller teams.\n\n4. Anyword: AI Writing Platform for Enterprise Marketing Teams\n\nAnyword is another data-driven AI tool designed for enterprise marketing teams.\n\nIts superpower is using data to help teams understand their audience and create content that resonates more.\n\nLike Copy.ai, Anyword offers a variety of templates to generate marketing content. But it has several advanced features, such as predictive scores to identify the most effective copy. \n\nThis tool can be especially useful for marketers who need to launch complex ad campaigns and optimize multi-channel content performance. \n\nKey Features\nPredictive performance scoring to evaluate copy effectiveness\nVersatile copywriting capabilities for emails, ads, websites, and more\nCustomization options to align with brand voice and audience preferences\nAnyword User Experience \n\nAnyword is quite easy to use and it won’t take you long to understand the interface and its features. \n\nYou can specify the copywriting formula and the target audience. We tested Anyword’s capability by prompting it to generate Instagram caption copy to promote a webinar for a wellness company. Here are the results: \n\nThe tool quickly generated multiple ads with different targeting options in minutes. \n\nAnother feature we tested was the Blog Wizard, which was also easy to use. It generates articles based on the keyword, topic, and description you provide.\n\nWe got a detailed outline with short paragraphs for each section. However, the tone of voice turned out quite robotic and the piece was fragmented, without content scoring or SEO optimization.\n\nOverall, the tool looks like a great option for creating short-form marketing copy and launching campaigns. However, its long-form content leaves much to be desired.\n\nPros and Cons\n\n🔥 Pros\n\n\t\n\n🤔 Cons\n\n\n\n\nAI and data analytics integrations for smarter copywriting decisions\n\nHelps to improve content engagement and conversion rates across your campaigns\n\nGenerates various types of marketing copy\n\n\t\n\nMight have a bit of a learning curve to fully leverage predictive scoring \n\nMight not be ideal for small teams and individual creators because of its complexity\n\nDoesn’t offer its own SEO data to optimize your content for search\n\nPricing\n\nThe Starter plan with one seat costs $49/month. The Data-Driven plan costs $99/month/seat, and the Business plan costs $499/month.\n\nFinal Verdict: Is Anyword Worth the Hype?\n\nAnyword is a quality tool for marketing and ad campaigns. However, right now it’s not well adapted for long-form content creation.\n\n5. Writesonic: AI Content Tool for Creating Quality Copy at Scale\n\nWritesonic is an AI-powered writing assistant that simplifies content creation for marketers and businesses. \n\nIt has four major features: AI article writer, Botsonic, Chatsonic, and the SEO suite. \n\nThe AI article writer creates long-form content pieces.\nChatsonic is a conversational assistant you interact with to generate content. It also has an image generation feature (Photosonic) that converts text to images. \nBotsonic is a chatbot-building feature that allows users to build custom chatbots for their websites without technical know-how. \nThe SEO Suite offers several SEO features based on Writesonic’s integration with SurferSEO.\nKey Features\nGenerates articles and other long-form content\nThe blog constructor allows for custom configuration—for example, finding pages for interlinking, selecting headings, choosing how to present citations, etc.\nIncludes tools for SEO optimization \nAllows for language and tone customization to match brand identity\nWritesonic User Experience \n\nYou can start using Writesonic with a free trial, which comes with 25 credits. \n\nWe tested its Writer’s AI Article Writer 6 and used it to create a blog post about building a content strategy.\n\nIt takes a while to generate the output—you’ll go through several steps, from entering a topic to selecting keywords and headings and specifying other details. \n\nThe AI writer was also a little slow to load and lagged as we interacted with the interface.\n\nThe tool created a blog post and added an AI-generated cover image.\n\nThe image was generic and looked like one of those corporate stock photos—although creating visuals for B2B topics can often be challenging.\n\nThe overall output was also a bit generic and not very in-depth. Some important sections were missing and the existing ones looked more like an outline.\n\nThe tool attributed the piece a content score of 67. However, it was quite fragmented, needed more details, and didn’t tackle many target keywords.\n\nNevertheless, the “Competitor Keywords” feature is helpful for ensuring that you have added all target phrases in your copy.\n\nPros and Cons\n\n🔥 Pros\n\n\t\n\n🤔 Cons\n\n\n\n\nSupports a wide range of content types\n\nHelps create SEO-friendly content in a consistent tone of voice\n\nOffers additional tools such as Chatsonic, Audiosonic, etc.\n\n\t\n\nThe tool’s functionality and pricing can seem complicated\n\nIt requires a more comprehensive content creation workflow\n\nYou might still need additional SEO tools like Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to create organic content\n\nPricing\nYou can test Writesonic with the freemium option or sign up for “Small Team” (a team of one) for $19/month. \nA monthly Writesonic subscription for a larger team is $500+ a month.\nWritesonic also offers different pricing options for its Botsonic tool.\nFinal Verdict: Is Writesonic Worth the Hype?\n\nWritesonlc seems promising in terms of its features for assembling blog posts and integrations for SEO analysis. However, the content generation needs many improvements.\n\n6. Rytr: The Best Affordable AI Writer Tool\n\nRytr offers AI writing assistant capabilities at a lower price than most of its competitors. This tool is a great starting point for beginners with lower budgets.\n\nWhat's cool about Rytr is that it supports 30+ languages, 20+ tones of voice to suit your content, and 40+ use cases, with the option of creating your own. \n\nUsers can simply provide a topic, tone, or personality, and Rytr adapts to meet the requirements.\n\nKey Features\nGenerates various types of content in seconds, including emails and social media posts\nEasy-to-use interface with customizable content creation options\nOffers multiple tone-of-voice types to choose from\nRytr User Experience \n\nRytr’s UI is clean, beginner-friendly, and easy to navigate. The dashboard allows you to manage documents and projects, which is great for writers who work with multiple clients.\n\nHowever, the tool is not well adapted to long-form content generation. It can create some blog ideas, outlines and separate sections, but they won’t be data-driven or optimized.\n\nThat being said, you can use Rytr to create simple copy for other formats, such as social media posts and basic ads.\n\nPros and Cons\n\n🔥 Pros\n\n\t\n\n🤔 Cons\n\n\n\n\nGenerates diverse short-form content types to meet various marketing needs\n\nAffordable pricing, which makes it a good choice for individual users \n\nCreates content in 30+ languages \n\n\t\n\nDoesn’t provide SEO data and optimization \n\nNot tailored to produce long-form content like blog posts\n\nDoesn’t offer other advanced data-driven features\n\nSuffers occasional downtime\n\nPricing\n\nRytr offers a free plan with several limitations. For $9 per month, use their “Saver” plan. For $29 per month, use their “Unlimited” plan.\n\nFinal Verdict: Is Rytr Worth the Hype?\n\nRytr is suitable for simple content generation on a budget. However, it’s not the best choice for long-form content creation and bigger teams.\n\n7. Sudowrite: Powerful AI Tool for Creative Writing\n\nSudowrite is a creative partner that uses advanced AI technology to assist new and experienced authors create good stories. It is easy to use, affordable, and produces quality output. \n\nSudowrite offers valuable features for brainstorming ideas, fleshing out characters, and creating synopses or outlines. \n\nWhat’s amazing is that you can train the tool to learn your writing style, and to guide how scenes, tone, and characters will play out. \n\nUnlike other fiction AI writing tools, Sudowrite can track everything, even individual scenes, so the output does not require heavy revisions. \n\nKey Features\nTakes AI-generated storytelling to the next level with colorful descriptions\nHelps creative writers outline, write, and edit a novel in less time than traditional writing\nAnalyzes character, tone, and plot arc\nSudowrite User Experience \n\nSudowrite’s long-form editor has various features, including Write, Describe, Rewrite, Brainstorm and Story Bible.\n\nThe flagship feature is the Story Bible, designed as a central hub for brainstorming ideas, defining key elements, and generating drafts of different chapters. \n\nIt’s very useful for keeping your story ideas organized.\n\nOn the Story Bible interface, you’re greeted with text boxes to brainstorm objects, characters, plot points, and more.\n\nFor example, you could describe an idea for a story universe. We asked the tool to generate ideas for a story about a world where no one sleeps:\n\nThen, Sudowrite will suggest specific ideas, some of which seem quite interesting. For example, it suggested writing a story about a shuttle that transports people to alternate dimensions within their own minds.\n\nOne downside of Story Bible is that it requires ongoing guidance: otherwise, it repeats plot points and cuts character conversations short. \n\nIt’s also worth noting that the tool does not have a plagiarism checker, so you have to double-check outcomes. \n\nPros and Cons\n\n🔥 Pros\n\n\t\n\n🤔 Cons\n\n\n\n\nUnique tool for creative and fiction writers\n\nProvides lots of options for brainstorming plots, characters, and more\n\nThe “Describe” feature is great for writers who struggle with sensory descriptions\n\n\t\n\nNo built-in plagiarism checker\n\nSome of its features are still in the experimental phase\n\nSlightly confusing interface\n\nPricing\n\nSudowrite offers “Hobby & Student” pricing at $19/month, “Professional” at $29/month, and “Max” at $59/month.\n\nFinal Verdict: Is Sudowrite Worth the Hype?\n\nSudowrite is a great tool to aid your creative writing and brainstorming. The tool offers many useful features and will act as your co-writer.\n\n8. ChatGPT: AI Chatbot for Generic AI-related Tasks\n\nChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, uses large language models to produce conversational texts. \n\nSo far, many of the tools we’ve explored in this article leverage OpenAI’s model.\n\nIn a nutshell, ChatGPT offers tasks related to writing, data analysis, brainstorming, and more.\n\nOpenAI has recently released ChatGPT-4o, an even faster model that is free for all ChatGPT users. \n\nThis new model is more advanced and offers more capabilities than its predecessors.\n\nIt is also \"multimodal,\" meaning it can generate and understand content in voice, text, and images.\n\nThe idea is that ChatGPT is becoming your personal digital assistant that can talk with you in real time, understand emotional clues, and interact with the real world:\n\nThat said, it’s not exactly well adapted to all content marketing needs. The tool doesn't offer SEO data or a blog editor, and it might take you numerous attempts to get the writing prompts right.\n\nKey Features\nSimple chat functionality for all tasks\nUseful for brainstorming and generating visual and text content\nLets you upload CSV files and analyze the data\nAllows you to create custom GPTs for different tasks \nChatGPT User Experience \n\nOur best experience with ChatGPT was discovering its potential beyond content creation. \n\nFor example, it’s a powerful tool for data analysis. One of the sample use cases is to upload a CSV list of keywords and ask the tool to clean your data and create clusters.\n\nOn the downside, ChatGPT's content output can be mediocre, and it is not connected to real-time data. \n\nIn other words, it can’t pull fresh information from the internet and won’t source target keywords or other competitive insights. There are many ChatGPT alternatives that outperform the tool in that sense.\n\nIt’s best to use ChatGPT for generic tasks—such as brainstorming and analysis—and leave content creation to a more specialized AI writing tool.\n\nPros and Cons\n\n🔥 Pros \n\n\t\n\n🤔 Cons\n\n\n\n\nEasy-to-use chatbot interface\n\nUseful features, such as creating custom GPTs and training AI on your writing samples\n\nNow includes DALL-E 3 for AI image generation \n\nLets you create custom GPTs\n\nChatGPT can now remember information between different chats\n\n\t\n\nDoesn’t offer SEO data or competitive insights \n\nDoesn’t have an interface adapted for content writing\n\nDoesn’t offer other content-related features, such as a Chrome Extension or CMS publishing\n\nSimilar prompts generate monotonous output. \n\n9. Wordtune: AI-powered Suggestions for Content Writing\n\nWordtune is your AI companion for writing content on the go. \n\nIt’s a Grammarly alternative that uses deep learning algorithms to understand the context and meaning behind your words. \n\nWith Wordtune, users can rephrase sentences, choose alternative words, and improve the grammar and punctuation of written content. \n\nIt has a Chrome browser extension that lets you work on various platforms, such as Google Docs, WordPress, or email.\n\nKey Features\nContent rephraser to suit tone, clarity, and formality.\nBasic grammar checker\nAI-powered auto-complete feature\nWordtune User Experience \n\nOnce you install Wordtune on Chrome, it appears as a ’W’ icon on your documents. \n\nYou can use it by highlighting a paragraph of text and clicking the ’W’ icon. \n\nIt also provides contextual suggestions and can help you complete a sentence if you get stuck.\n\nOverall, Wordtune is a great tool, although it sometimes gets buggy and unresponsive. \n\nPros and Cons\n\n🔥 Pros \n\n\t\n\n🤔 Cons\n\n\n\n\nEasy-to-use interface\n\nVariety of rephrasing options \n\nMultilingual support\n\n\t\n\nLimited creativity \n\nNeed to fact-check accuracy\n\nLimited for long-form content\n\nPricing:\nYou can use Wordtune for free with 10 rewrites per day. \nThe premium plan, which offers unlimited rewrites, starts at $9.99\nFinal Verdict: Is Wordtune Worth the Hype?\n\nWordtune is a useful Chrome extension for everyday use. It can help you speed up writing and editing and aid in routine tasks. \n\nNote that there are other alternatives you can try. For example, some AI content tools, like ContentShake AI, offer a free Chrome extension alongside their main products.\n\n10. Gemini AI: AI Chat with Improved Writing\n\nGoogle developed Gemini as a data-trained language model chatbot to communicate in a human-like manner. \n\nIt is designed to be conversational and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\nMuch like ChatGPT, Gemini has numerous use cases and can generate various types of content—not just marketing materials. \n\nWhere Gemini stands out is in the quality of its output and its internet access, which ChatGPT lacks. \n\nKey Features\nInformation retrieval through Google search\nLets you double-check Gemini’s responses using the “Google” button \nUseful for writing less robotic-sounding copy \nMultilingual communication\nGemini User Experience \n\nGemini shares many similarities with ChatGPT, but one way it stands out is in the quality of its output. \n\nOverall, it produces copy that sounds less robotic and has a more human, conversational tone of voice. For example, here’s a blog intro written by Gemini:\n\nThe result is not perfect, but it is a lot better than the “In the fast-paced digital landscape” intro produced by ChatGPT below.\n\nAs for research, Gemini is still prone to hallucinations and provides results that sound plausible but incorrect. So, there’s a need for fact-checking. \n\nPros and Cons\n\n🔥 Pros \n\n\t\n\n🤔 Cons\n\n\n\n\nEasy-to-use interface\n\nCreative text generation\n\nMultilingual support\n\n\t\n\nLimited creativity \n\nAI hallucinations\n\nPricing\n\nYou can explore the tool with a free trial. The advanced plan starts at $19.99.\n\nFinal Verdict: Is Gemini Worth the Hype?\n\nGemini might be less effective when it comes to analyzing information and working with data. However, it tends to produce better output than ChatGPT. So, it’s definitely worth a try for simple short-form copy generation.\n\nOther AI Content Tools You Can Try\n\nHere are a few other specialized AI content tools you might find useful. \n\nEach one is designed to tackle more specific aspects of content creation and optimization, such as boosting engagement and SEO performance.\n\nSurferSEO: Streamlines the process of creating SEO-optimized content.
