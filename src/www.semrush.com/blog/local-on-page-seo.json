  "content": "What Is Local On-Page SEO?\n\nLocal on-page SEO means optimizing your webpages to improve your organic (unpaid) local search rankings and get more website traffic—and foot traffic if you have one or more physical locations.\n\nIt’s part of a broader process known as local SEO. Which involves tactics to boost your entire site’s local traffic and visibility.\n\nIn this article, we’ll talk about the importance of on-page SEO for local businesses. Then walk you through some local on-page SEO tips to improve your chances of ranking for relevant search terms.\n\nWhy On-Page SEO Matters for Local Businesses\n\nOn-page SEO is particularly helpful for local businesses because local search is focused on finding nearby products or services. Meaning searchers are motivated to take action.\n\nThis has to do with user intent. Which is the reason behind a searcher’s query.\n\nFor example, consider this list of local keywords in the Keyword Magic Tool. And notice that the “Intent” column has a “C” for most of the terms at the top.\n\nThis means those keywords have commercial intent. And that indicates searchers are further into their buying journeys and comparing options before making a purchase decision.\n\nIn short, appearing in these types of local search results can drive traffic from visitors who are likely to become customers. Which translates to revenue potential.\n\n9 Tips for Improving Local On-Page SEO\n\nFollow our on-page local SEO checklist below to potentially gain visibility in local searches. \n\nNow, let’s delve into each tip:\n\n1. Do Local Keyword Research\n\nLocal keyword research involves discovering search terms nearby audiences are searching. So you can target relevant terms in your content. \n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool to do your local keyword research.\n\nEnter a term that’s relevant to your business and location. And click “Search.”\n\nIn this case, you’ll get a broad list of keywords people use when looking up plumbers in Miami.\n\nThe tool shows you key metrics that provide insights into how each keyword performs in search.\n\nIntent: There are four categories of search intent—informational (I), navigational (N), commercial (C), and transactional (T)\nVolume: How many searches (on average) a specific keyword gets each month \nKeyword difficulty (KD %): How hard it is to rank highly on search engine results pages (SERPs) for a given keyword\n\nHow can you use these metrics to choose the right terms? \n\nFirst, consider that the higher a keyword’s search volume, the more traffic it could drive to your site. \n\nBut you may not be able to feasibly rank for that term if it also has a high difficulty score. Especially if you have a new website.\n\nSo, you might consider starting with low-volume, easy-to-rank-for keywords to start generating site traffic. And move on to more competitive, high-volume ones after you’ve begun to establish a presence.\n\nJust make sure to only target keywords relevant to your business and location(s). You’re more likely to rank for them. And they’re more likely to bring in the right potential customers.\n\nFor instance, avoid creating a page that targets “emergency plumbing service new york city” if you don’t offer emergency plumbing help or serve that area. \n\nYou’re unlikely to appear in search results. And if you do, users will leave your site disappointed.\n\nTip\n\nLearn more about finding and choosing the right keywords for SEO in our comprehensive guide.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Write Helpful Content That Resonates with Local Audiences\n\nPublishing site content tailored to your local audience signals that you’re a trustworthy source they can turn to. Making them more likely to choose you over your competitors.\n\nHere are some helpful ideas for publishing great localized content:\n\nEmphasize local relevance: Write about topics relevant to your location and highlight where you offer services if applicable\nWrite for your audience first: Answer questions local users care about, address their pain points, and provide solutions to their specific problems\nHighlight your expertise: Make your knowledge of the topic and local issues apparent\nCreate readable content: Use images, lists, and short sentences and paragraphs to make your content easy to read\nPublish original content: Provide unique information your local competitors haven’t covered in their content\n\nSEO Writing Assistant can help you polish your content to meet some of these criteria. Like checking if your copy is original and easy to read.\n\n3. Optimize Pages for User Intent and Target Keywords\n\nContent that considers each keyword’s intent and focuses on providing truly useful information is more likely to rank. And contribute to your larger business goals. \n\nSo, focus on what searchers care about. And incorporate keywords naturally—don’t force them. Because using keywords too many times risks triggering Google’s spam filters.\n\nHere are some general best practices for where to include local keywords:\n\nURL: Create a short URL slug (the end part of the URL) that contains your primary keyword\nHeadline: Include your primary keyword and format it as an H1\nTitle tag (the HTML that specifies a page’s title): Feature your primary keyword, keep it between 50 and 60 characters, and mention your location where relevant\nMeta description (the HTML that provides a brief page summary): Include local keywords, keep it to 105 characters or fewer, and add a call to action (CTA)\nThe first paragraph of your content: Include your target keyword in the first paragraph. Because it’s a great place to indicate which location the content is relevant to.\nSubheadings: Mention your local keywords in subheadings where it makes sense to include them\nImage alt text: Write descriptive text illustrating the image, including local keywords if they fit in naturally\nThroughout the content: Add keywords in a way that sounds natural to readers and genuinely helps them understand the topic\n\nUse Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker to assess page-level optimization in your published content.\n\nEnter your domain and click “Get ideas.”\n\nSelect the location (down to the city) you’re focused on, add your local keywords, and click “Collect ideas.”\n\nThe tool will generate ideas on how you can enhance each page. Click the “# ideas” button next to one of the pages under “Top pages to optimize.”\n\nIn the “Content” section, you’ll see a list of recommendations. And an overview of things you’re doing well.\n\nImplement the recommendations, and you’ll be one step closer to ranking higher for your local keywords.\n\nGet Optimization Ideas\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nSign up Now →\n4. Create Dedicated Landing Pages for Localized Services\n\nLanding pages that include local search terms and are specific to the areas you serve can improve your visibility among local audiences. And help persuade them to do business with you.\n\nGoing back to the Miami plumbing business example, those landing pages could cover local search terms across different keyword clusters (groups of related search terms) like:\n\nNew construction plumbing: “plumbing contractors new construction miami,” “new home plumbing near me,” and “miami new construction plumbing”\nCommercial plumbing: “commercial plumbing company miami” and “emergency commercial plumbing miami”\nGas system plumbing: “emergency gas leak repair miami”\n\nFor example, here’s a landing page from a business focused on new construction plumbing services in Miami:\n\nIf you serve multiple locations, creating landing pages for each location may help you rank for even more search terms. \n\nPro tip\n\nUse Landing Page Builder to easily create and publish landing pages at scale. No coding experience required.\n\n5. Optimize Images for Local Search\n\nUsing image SEO helps your visuals drive more organic traffic. And it works at the local level.\n\nWhich you can see in these image results on Google: \n\nHow do you optimize images for local search?\n\nHere’s what you need to do:\n\nWrite descriptive alt text: Include locally relevant keywords (or even just the location) in alt text when they fit in naturally (e.g., “a plumber fixing a leaky kitchen sink in a Miami home” or “plumbers working on a new construction site in Miami”)\nProperly name your image files: Give your images descriptive names (e.g., “miami-plumber-unclogging-drain.jpg”) instead of generic file names (e.g., “img44366.jpg”). But don’t try to force keywords. \n\nDoing this helps search engines understand what your images are about. And that makes them more likely to appear in traditional and image search results. \n\nTip\n\nCompress large files to prevent your site from loading slowly and negatively impacting rankings. Google recommends keeping the image size below 5 MB.\n\n6. Harness the Power of Internal Linking\n\nInternal links are hyperlinks that connect different pages of your website. Which helps users to navigate your site and search engines to understand your site’s structure. \n\nThere are two main types of internal links:\n\nNavigational: Links in your website’s menu bar, footer, and sidebar\nContextual: Links within the content on your site\n\nIncluding navigational links that make it easy to find area-specific content promotes a good user experience. Because it helps users find what they’re looking for. \n\nHere’s an example:\n\nOnce you have navigational links in place, think about how to implement contextual internal links. \n\nFor example, you’ll likely want to interlink between all the pages on your site that are related to Aventura, Florida. \n\nAnd do so using logical anchor text that indicates what the linked page is about.\n\nFor instance, you might use the anchor text “plumbers in Aventura” when linking to that location-specific landing page.\n\nThen, use Site Audit to identify any internal linking mistakes. \n\nFirst, set up the tool with these configuration instructions. \n\nOnce your audit is complete, click “View details” in the “Internal Linking” section.\n\nOn the right, you’ll see a list of potential issues with detailed explanations on how to fix them.\n\nFor example, “Links with non-descriptive anchor text” will show which anchor text needs optimizing.\n\n7. Implement Local Business Schema\n\nLocal schema markup is code you add to your site to help search engines better understand your location-specific content. And it can display that information in search results.\n\nFor example, you can see the address, operating hours, and phone number in the result below. \n\nWith Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper, you can easily create the code to add to your site.\n\nGo to the tool and select “Local Businesses.” \n\nThen, enter your site’s URL and click “Start Tagging.”\n\nOn the right-hand side, you’ll see a list of elements you can specify. \n\nGo through the list by selecting different page elements and clarifying which category it addresses. \n\nWhen you’re done, click “Create HTML.”\n\nClick “Download.”\n\nAdd the code in the <head> section of the appropriate page.\n\nThen, verify that the code was implemented correctly by running Site Audit. And look for errors in the “Markup” thematic report. \n\n8. Including NAP Data and Ensuring Consistency\n\nName, address, and phone number (NAP) citations—sometimes called NAP+W to also include your website—mention key information about your business. And Google is more likely to deem your business trustworthy if they’re consistent.\n\nHaving the right NAP data on your site is especially important because directories like Yelp can take this information from your site to automatically create a listing for you—like this one:\n\nThat means having one wrong digit in your phone number could lead to discrepancies in your listings. Which makes you appear less reputable and can lead to losing out on potential customers.\n\nTry to include the NAP data in your header, footer, and contact page as text—not an image. So search engines can easily understand it.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s Listing Management to manage your local business presence across online directories. The tool will find all your listings and distribute the right NAP information automatically.\n\n9. Monitor Local SEO Performance\n\nMonitoring your local search rankings will help you understand what kinds of pages perform best. So you know which pages to replicate and which ones might need extra attention.\n\nSemrush’s Position Tracking tool lets you do that easily and automatically.\n\nEnter your domain and click “Set up tracking.”\n\nChoose a search engine, device, location, and language. And enter your business name for tracking local map pack (the SERP section featuring a map and a few local business listings) performance.\n\nClick “Continue To Keywords.”\n\nNext, enter your local keywords and click “Add keywords to campaign.” \n\nTick the box to receive weekly ranking updates via email if you wish, and then click “Start Tracking.”\n\nWhen the tool is ready, click the “Overview” tab in the navigation bar.\n\nScroll down to “Rankings Overview” to see a list of where you appear for your chosen local keywords.\n\nYou can easily see your current rankings compared to your rankings from the previous period. And which page ranks for each keyword.\n\nYou’ll be able to adjust your local on-page SEO efforts based on the changes you see—both good and bad.\n\nTrack Your Rankings\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nDrive Search Results with Local On-Page SEO\n\nImplementing the above local on-page SEO tips can help local businesses increase their ranking potential. \n\nAnd it will be much easier to keep an eye on all the moving parts with the right tools.\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account to start improving your local SEO results.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign up Now →",
