  "content": "What Is Keyword Intent?\n\nKeyword intent, also known as search intent, is what searchers want to achieve after they conduct a specific search.\n\nFor example, when someone searches “buy orchid seeds,” the intent behind that search is probably to make a purchase.\n\nBut someone searching just “orchid seeds” might not want to make a purchase. It’s possible that they just want to learn more about orchid seeds.\n\nGoogle’s goal is to answer searcher’s queries as efficiently as possible. So, if your content answers a keyword’s search intent, you’re more likely to rank for that keyword.\n\nThis is why it’s important to identify keyword intent before you create a piece of content to target a specific keyword.\n\nLet’s elaborate on that.\n\nWhy Understanding Keyword Intent Is So Valuable in SEO\n\nUnderstanding and addressing keyword intent will increase your chances of ranking for the keywords you want to target.\n\nIn other words, Google uses keyword intent to determine what should appear for which searches. So searchers can get to the pages that can best address their queries.\n\nLet’s use the examples above to illustrate.\n\nSomeone searching for “buy orchid seeds” likely wants to make a purchase. So here’s what the results page looks like:\n\nThe first result is Amazon. Because Google knows the searcher wants to buy.\n\nSomeone searching for just “orchid seeds,” on the other hand, might want to buy. Or might want more information about orchid seeds.\n\nSo here’s what the results look like:\n\nAmazon is still number one, to cover purchasing intent. But Google also surfaces articles that tell searchers more about orchid seeds. And how to grow them from scratch.\n\nSo, your complete guide to orchid seeds could rank for the “orchid seeds” keyword. But probably not for the “buy orchid seeds” keyword.\n\n4 Types of Keyword Intent\n\nThere are four main keyword intent types:\n\nNavigational keyword intent\nInformational keyword intent\nCommercial keyword intent\nTransactional keyword intent\n\nLet’s learn more about them.\n\nPro tip: Sign up for the Keyword Overview tool for free so you can look for the different types of keywords yourself.\n\n1. Navigational Keyword Intent \n\nNavigational keywords are used when the searcher wants to get to a specific page or website.\n\nIn this case, the user typically knows exactly what they’re looking for.\n\nHere are some examples: \n\nYoutube\nFacebook login\nAmazon shipping policy\nSemrush keyword overview tool\nMama’s little bakery chicago address\n\nIn general, navigational keywords are low intent. Meaning that the reader probably isn’t planning to make a purchase.\n\nHowever, in some cases, they can lead to a business-related action.\n\nFor example, when someone searches for “semrush backlink audit tool,” they’re probably looking to use that tool.\n\nThey find the tool through search and then sign up for free. After using the tool, they may realize that they want to access more features. Which would lead to a transaction.\n\nThese keywords are usually branded. So, ranking for them is a bit easier.\n\n2. Informational Keyword Intent\n\nPeople use informational keywords when they want to learn something new.\n\nThese keywords can come in the form of questions and start with:\n\nWhat is\nHow to\nWhere is\n\nFor example:\n\nWhat is link building\nHow to change a lightbulb\nWhere is nyc\n\nBut informational keywords don’t only come in question forms. They can also look like this:\n\nPasta bolognese recipe\nMaldives time now\nDisavow backlinks\n\nInformational keywords are also low intent.\n\nBut that shouldn’t discourage you from targeting these keywords.\n\nTarget informational keywords with:\n\nHow-to blog posts\nLong-form articles\nInformational videos\nInfographics\n\nBy creating accurate informational and educational content, you establish yourself as a trustworthy source of information for your target audience.\n\nWhich means that they’ll likely come back to your website to learn more.\n\nAnd if they ever become ready to make a purchase, they’ll already be familiar with your brand and your website.\n\n3. Commercial Keyword Intent\n\nPeople use keywords with commercial intent when they’re doing research before making a purchase.\n\nThe user isn’t ready to make a purchase just yet.\n\nThey need a little more information before hitting that “buy” button. Which is why commercial keywords are often branded.\n\nHere are some examples of branded commercial keywords:\n\nMacbook pro vs macbook air\nHARO alternatives\nSemrush reviews\n\nBut they can also be unbranded, like:\n\nBest running shoes\nCustom birthday cakes\nWedding dresses\n\nAs you can see, commercial keywords can often include some of these words:\n\nVs\nAlternatives\nReviews\nComparison\nBest\n\nCommercial keywords are high-intent keywords.\n\nThat means there’s a higher chance that the user will take a business action. Most likely, make a purchase.\n\nTarget commercial keywords with:\n\nProduct/service landing pages\nComparison articles\nTestimonials and reviews\n4. Transactional Keyword Intent\n\nPeople who use transactional keywords are ready to make a purchase. Or subscribe to your services.\n\nLet’s have a look at a list of buyer intent keywords:\n\nSemrush promo code\nBuy audi tt\nItalian restaurants near me\n\nAs you can see, the users are ready to do or buy something. \n\nWhich is why transactional keywords have the highest intent out of all four types of keywords. And that transactional keywords have the highest impact on your conversion rate.\n\nTarget transactional keywords with the following types of content:\n\nSubscription or signup pages\nDeals and coupons pages\nProduct/service pages\nFree trial pages\n\nConversions aren’t always sales. Conversions can also mean subscribing to your newsletter, booking a discovery call, or filling out a questionnaire.\n\nSide note: Transactional keywords are also important for PPC (pay-per-click) strategies. To learn more about PPC and how it differs from SEO, read our PPC guide.\n\nHow to Identify Keyword Intent Using Semrush\n\nFind the intent behind each keyword in seconds with our Keyword Research tools.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nUse the Keyword Overview Tool to Find the Right Keywords to Target\n\nInstead of manually trying to figure out keyword intent, use a keyword research tool.\n\nLet’s use “amazon shipping policy” for this walkthrough.\n\nGo to the Keyword Overview tool.\n\nType in the keyword “amazon shipping policy.” And click on “Search.”\n\nYou’ll immediately see the search intent: “Navigational” and “Transactional.”\n\nIt’s navigational because a user is looking for a specific page on Amazon’s website.\n\nAnd it’s transactional because they’re probably ready to buy something but want to check the shipping policy before they do.\n\nThis is a branded, high-intent keyword example.\n\nNow, the next question is: Should you target that keyword?\n\nLet’s see.\n\nScroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section to see the top 10 search results for that keyword.\n\nIn this case, the top 10 results are all from Amazon’s website.\n\nWhich means users want to see information from Amazon. So, if you’re not Amazon, you probably shouldn’t try to rank for this keyword.\n\nHere’s another example: “make coffee at home.”\n\nOnce again, go to the Keyword Overview tool and type in the keyword. Then, click on the “Search” button.\n\nYou’ll see that the intent of this keyword is informational.\n\nTo find out whether you should target that keyword, scroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section.\n\nThe top 10 results all contain recipes.\n\nSo, if you want to target this keyword, you should probably create a recipe page or a video about how to make coffee at home.\n\nTo create the best possible piece of content, study the top-ranking results to see what makes them stand out and what the user wants to see.\n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool to Get More Keywords with the Right Intent\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool pulls up a list of keywords related to your seed keyword. You can then use filters to get a list of related keywords with specific intents.\n\nLet’s say you want to find out what the most popular navigational keywords for your brand are.\n\nGo to Keyword Magic Tool. Type in your brand name and click on the “Search” button.\n\nAbove the list of keywords, click on the “Intent” filter. A drop-down menu will appear; select “Navigational.”\n\nThen click on the “Apply” button.\n\nYou’ll get a list of all the navigational keywords related to your brand.\n\nThis intent filter in the Keyword Magic Tool is very useful when you’re doing keyword research.\n\nYou can see the keyword intent in the “Intent” column and group keywords based on that.\n\nThis will save you time and help you plan your SEO strategy.\n\nHow Semrush Identifies Keyword Intent\n\nTo give each keyword an intent value, Semrush uses a machine-learning algorithm that looks into the following factors:\n\nSERP features present in keyword search results\nThe presence of words in the keyword that indicate the mood/intention of the user (for example: buy, address, how)\nWhether the keyword is branded or not branded\n\nSome common indicators include:\n\nWords & SERP Features Semrush Uses to Identify Keyword Intent\n\n\n \t\n\nNavigational\n\n\t\n\nInformational\n\n\t\n\nCommercial\n\n\t\n\nTransactional\n\n\n\n\nWords Included in Search\n\n\t\n\nBrand names\n\n\t\n\nHow, what, tutorial, why\n\n\t\n\nBest, review, comparison\n\n\t\n\nPrice, buy, near me\n\n\n\n\nSERP Features & Appearance\n\n\t\n\nSitelinks, knowledge panel, the number of times a business domain appears in the top 10 results\n\n\t\n\nNews, recipes, knowledge panel, featured snippet\n\n\t\n\nLocal pack, Google Ads, jobs, review stars\n\n\t\n\nPopular products, shopping results\n\nTake note: \n\nA keyword can have more than one intent. \n\nFor example, a keyword with informational intent could also have a commercial or navigational intent.\n\nIn fact, the keyword “12 string guitar” has both informational and commercial intent.\n\nRefresh Your Content with Keyword Intent In Mind\n\nKeyword intent can make the difference between your content ranking well and getting buried in search results.\n\nKeep keyword intent in mind while doing keyword research and creating content to appear on the right results pages.\n\nSpeed things up with Semrush’s keyword research tools, like:\n\nKeyword Overview: Get tons of data on a specific keyword, including search intent\nKeyword Magic Tool: Get a list of thousands of relevant keywords, along with their search intents\n\nYou can test both tools out without a paid plan—simply sign up for a free trial.\n\nTo learn more about keyword intent, have a look at these articles:\n\nHow to Identify Search Intent in Organic Results: A Complete Guide\nHow to Find Commercial Intent Based Keyword Phrases\nWhat Are Buyer Keywords and How Do I Find Them?\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
