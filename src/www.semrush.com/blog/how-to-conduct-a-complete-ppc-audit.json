  "content": "A poorly performing ad campaign is like pouring money down the drain. \n\nTo analyze and optimize your pay-per-click (PPC) strategy, follow our 10-step PPC audit checklist. \n\nBut let’s go over some background first.\n\nWhat Is a PPC Audit?\n\nA PPC audit is an in-depth analysis of your PPC campaigns. \n\nIt shows you where you’re performing well—and where you may be lacking. \n\nIn short, PPC audits aim to:\n\nOptimize campaigns\nSave money\nUncover new opportunities\nMaximize return on investment (ROI)\nCorrect mistakes\nIncrease conversions\nProduce valuable insights\n\nNote: There are multiple types of PPC ads. But we’ll be focusing on Google Search ads.\n\nHow Do I Run a PPC Audit?\n\nYou run a PPC audit by compiling and assessing your paid ad campaign data. \n\nThis can be done manually, with the help of PPC tools (like Advertising Research, shown below), or a combination of the two.\n\nTip: You shouldn’t fully automate this process through PPC audit software. Tools can help, but manual assessment will give you a more valuable audit. \n\nA good PPC audit analyzes campaign settings, costs, ad groups, and ad performance to identify areas of success. And areas that need improvement. \n\nBut a great PPC audit takes it a step further by looking at what competitors are doing. And making adjustments based on your target market. \n\nThe 10-Step PPC Audit Checklist\n\nAuditing your PPC campaigns may feel overwhelming. But the value is worth the effort. \n\nTo make the process more manageable, follow this 10-step PPC audit guide.\n\nTip: Review your conversion goals before doing a PPC audit. Having a clear sense of what you’re trying to accomplish (signups, sales, leads, etc.) will sharpen your analysis.\n\n1. Organize the Data \n\nStart your audit by downloading and organizing your paid campaign data into spreadsheets. \n\nYou can use these spreadsheets to easily assess your campaigns. And create a PPC audit report to share with the entire marketing team.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nDownload your Google Ads data as an Excel or Google Sheets spreadsheet\nName the spreadsheet for the current season and year (e.g., PPC Audit Summer 2024)\nAnalyze each campaign one at a time. Highlight problem areas (like low impressions). And success areas (like high conversions).\nLook for trends among campaigns that are doing well. And among those that aren’t. \n\nHaving these sheets will help you visualize your campaigns at a high level, evaluate your progress, and inform any actions you take to improve your PPC efforts. \n\n2. Check Your Settings\n\nLog into your Google Ads account and Google Analytics account and check the settings. To make sure you’re avoiding needless errors. \n\nWhile reviewing your settings, ask the following questions:\n\nAre your conversions being properly tracked? You can check your tracking statuses in your Google Ads account. \nAre your naming conventions consistent, specific, and descriptive?\nAre ad groups appropriately organized into categories and subcategories? \nIs your Google Analytics account linked to your Google Ads account? Check this in your Google Ads account under “Tools and settings” > “Setup” > “Linked accounts” > “Google Analytics (GA4) and Firebase” > “Manage & link.” Find your Analytics property and make sure the status is listed as “Linked.”\n3. Review Ad Content\n\nNow, it’s time to take a look at your ads’ content. Because an ad will succeed (or fail) based on how the unique selling proposition (USP) is conveyed. \n\nYou probably determined your USP in the initial stages of planning your PPC campaign. \n\nBut you’ve changed since then. As have your competitors. And your audience. \n\nSo it’s time to re-examine your USP and optimize how you promote it through ad copy. \n\nSee How Your USP Stands Up to Your Competitors’ USPs\n\nTake a look at what competitors are including in their ads so you can ensure your USP is truly unique. \n\nHere’s how:\n\nFind Your PPC Competitors\n\nYou first need to identify who you’re competing against with your PPC ads.\n\nGo to the Advertising Research tool. Enter your domain and click “Search.”\n\nNavigate to the “Competitors” tab. \n\nYou’ll see a list of paid competitors sorted by the ones that present the most competition. \n\nHere, you can see who’s bidding on the same keywords as you, how many paid keywords they have, how much paid traffic they bring in, and what their estimated Google Ads budget is. \n\nIdentify your top competitors and open their websites in a separate tab by clicking on the arrow icon. To get a sense of their messaging.\n\nAnalyze Your Competitors’ Ad Copy\n\nThe next step is reviewing the copy your competitors are using in their ads. To see what works for them and gain inspiration for your own campaigns.\n\nMove over to the “Ads Copies” tab in the Advertising Research tool. Enter a competitor’s domain in the search bar at the top and click “Search.”\n\nIn this report, you can view the headlines, URLs, and descriptions your competitor has used in their ads. \n\nAnalyze what your competitors are doing. \n\nWhat are their USPs? Calls to action? Promos and deals? \n\nPay close attention to which keywords trigger which ad copy. To do this, click where it says “Keywords” under a specific ad. \n\nUse this information to gauge how your competitors are promoting solutions to users’ problems through their ad copy. Then, find ways to improve on what they’re doing. \n\nUncover Your Competitors’ Search Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nReview Your Ad Copy for Accuracy\n\nReviewing your own ad copy for accuracy might seem obvious, but it’s a step that can easily be overlooked. \n\nAs part of your PPC audit, look for ad content errors like:\n\nSpelling and grammar mistakes\nMisspelled display URLs or URLs that don’t match the landing page\nOutdated promotions \nExpired pricing\nFind Optimization Opportunities\n\nImproving ad content will take time, but you can uncover ideas for strengthening your headlines, URLs, and descriptions in your audit. \n\nOptimized ad content will include:\n\nA USP that stands out from the competition\nA call to action\nRelevant keywords\nContent that matches keyword intent (the reason behind a searcher’s query)\nA display URL that indicates the contents of the landing page\nAn accurate and attention-grabbing headline\n\nTip: You can identify broad areas that need improvement through a PPC audit. But copy optimization should be an ongoing process.\n\nEnsure You’re Using Ad Assets\n\nAd assets (formerly known as ad extensions) are additional links that show even more information. And they provide easy ways to increase engagement on your ads. \n\nHere’s an example of what they look like:\n\nGoogle will automatically determine which assets to display to improve an ad’s performance. But not all assets are automatically generated. \n\nMake sure you’ve set up every relevant ad asset. So Google can choose the best options for each ad. \n\nFinally, double-check all your assets for accuracy.\n\n4. Check Your Quality Score\n\nA higher Google Ads Quality Score (how Google rates your ad’s quality compared to other advertisers’ ads) means lower ad cost and better ad placement. \n\nQuality Scores range from 1 to 10. And according to Google:\n\nA higher Quality Score means that your ad and landing page are more relevant and useful to someone searching for your keyword, compared to other advertisers.\n\nEach keyword’s Quality Score is based on the following factors:\n\nExpected click-through rate (CTR)\nAd relevance \nLanding page relevance\n\nCheck your Quality Score by going to your Google Ads account and clicking on the “Campaigns” icon.\n\nThen click on the “Search keywords” section. \n\nClick “Search keywords.”\n\nThen, click on the columns icon (three bars). In the upper right corner of the table. \n\nUnder “Modify columns for keywords,” click “Quality Score.”\n\nHere you’ll see your Quality Score. Adjust your table settings to view different components of your Quality Score.\n\nIf your Quality Score is a 7 or lower, there’s room to improve. To increase your Quality Score:\n\nOptimize ad relevance by matching your ad’s message to the intent behind its keywords\nOptimize landing page relevance by making sure it delivers everything the ad promises\nOrganize your keywords into tighter ad groups\n5. Analyze Your Keyword Targeting\n\nAnalyzing your keyword targeting ensures you aren’t wasting budget. \n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nOptimize Your Ad Groups\n\nReview your ad groups to determine whether you need to add, delete, or reorganize keywords. \n\nStart by looking at the PPC audit spreadsheet you created to identify weak spots (like low impressions or conversions). This may reveal which ad groups need improvement. \n\nImprove your ad groups with the following steps:\n\nMake sure your groups are tightly themed. Each ad group should be made up of keywords with the same target. For example, a keyword aimed at selling (“order pizza online”) should not be in the same ad group as a keyword aimed at informing (“best cheese for pizza”).\nEnsure ad groups don’t have more than 20 keywords (aim for five to 10 keywords per group)\nDelete keywords with low search volumes (~100 monthly search volume or lower), so your ad groups aren’t diluted with keywords that enough people aren’t searching for\nRemove keywords with low impressions or move them to a different group, as this indicates your ad doesn’t match that keyword’s intent\nPause seasonal keywords, like back-to-school or holiday keywords, if they aren’t relevant to the current season\nCheck that your keyword match types align with your PPC goals and budget\n\nFurther reading: Learn how to use Semrush’s keyword research tools to optimize your keyword targeting.\n\nUncover New Ad Group Ideas\n\nFinding new ad group ideas can help you reach even more audiences.\n\nTo find new ideas for organizing keywords into ad groups, go to Keyword Strategy Builder and enter one to five seed keywords (broad search terms related to your business) that you want to develop or reconfigure your ad groups around.\n\nThen, click “Create list.”\n\nNext, you can see a visual preview under the Topics and Pages tab. You can see this example has 763 keywords. \n\nIf you scroll down, you can see your pillar pages and subpages listed. Click the carrot to see each keyword cluster’s breakdown by intent, Keyword Difficulty (a measure of how hard it is to rank in the top 10 organic results for that term), and monthly search volume. \n\nThe tool even shows which clusters have the highest ranking potential.\n\nUse this report to identify new ad group opportunities. Or ways to optimize your current groups. \n\nUncover New Ad Group Ideas\n\nwith the Keyword Strategy Builder Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nRefine Your Negative Keywords\n\nNegative keywords are terms you can add to your campaigns to keep ads from appearing when users search for them. \n\nIt’s a good idea to leverage negative keywords to prevent wasted budget and irrelevant traffic. \n\nIn your Google Ads search terms report, you’ll see metrics on which search terms are triggering your ads. And how your ads are performing for those searches. \n\nTo see this report, go to “Campaigns” > “Insights and reports” > “Search terms.”\n\nIf you notice a search term triggering an ad with poor engagement rates, your ad isn’t delivering what the user is looking for when using that term. \n\nUse these search terms as jumping-off points for expanding your negative keywords lists. \n\n6. Analyze Competitors’ Keyword Targeting\n\nEvaluating your competitors’ keyword strategies can help you gain a competitive edge. \n\nHere’s how you can incorporate competitive keyword research into your PPC audit:\n\nCheck Your Competitors’ Past and Current Ad Positions\n\nEvaluating the ads your competitors have run in the past will reveal which keywords they’re targeting. Which can help you identify gaps or gain inspiration for your own ad groups. \n\nStart by choosing one competitor to assess. \n\nGo to Advertising Research, enter their domain, click “Search,” and navigate to the “Ads History” tab. \n\nYou can use the “Advanced filters” menu to exclude keywords that include that competitor’s brand name.\n\nThis will generate a report of the keywords your competitor is bidding on and what ads they’ve run over the past year. \n\nYou can also export the report as a spreadsheet. \n\nNext, navigate to the “Position Changes” tab.\n\nThis report shows you new, lost, improved, and declined positions for keywords your competitor is bidding on. \n\nFind Keyword Gaps\n\nIdentifying keyword opportunities you’re overlooking can give you ideas for reaching more audiences.\n\nAnd you can find opportunities with the Keyword Gap tool. \n\nEnter up to four of your competitors’ root domains along with your own. Then, click “Compare.”\n\nSwitch the keyword type from “Organic keywords” to “Paid keywords.”\n\nThen, scroll down to the table. Switch to the “Missing” tab to view keywords you don’t rank for but all of your competitors do.\n\nThis can reveal relevant keywords you may want to start bidding on for your own campaigns.\n\n7. Assess Your CTR & Conversion Rates\n\nAssessing your click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate reveals ways to improve ad performance.\n\nToo low of a CTR can lead to a poor Quality Score. But too high of a CTR combined with a low conversion rate can mean money wasted on low-quality traffic. \n\nYou can check your CTR in your Google Ads account dashboard. \n\nIf your CTR is low, here are some ways to improve it:\n\nMake sure ads are showing during prime conversion times\nChange your CPC bid strategy\nTest different ad copy\nRefine your audience targeting\nTighten your ad groups. Make sure they each have a unified theme. And that the ads match every keyword’s intent. \nOptimize your ad assets by providing relevant, up-to-date information about your business. And make sure you’ve set up all applicable manual ad assets. \n\nTip: There’s no consensus on what a good CTR is, and the benchmarks vary by industry. Research your industry and analyze your most successful ads’ CTRs to define a goal rate.\n\nNext, you can check your conversion rates. \n\nIf your CTR and conversion rates are both low, focus first on improving your CTR. \n\nIf your CTR is good but your conversion rate isn’t, it’s probably due to one of two problems:\n\nYour landing page isn’t optimized to convert\nYour landing page isn’t delivering what your ad promised users\n\nTake a look at your landing page to determine what you can do to improve performance. \n\n8. Review Location Targeting\n\nReviewing and optimizing your location targeting can eliminate wasted spend. \n\nYou may be wasting money delivering ads to locations that you can’t serve. Or wasting potential profit not delivering ads to valuable locations. \n\nFocus your efforts on three areas:\n\nDetermine where your ads perform the best. In Google Ads, you can check your location performance by going to “Campaigns” > “Insights & reports” > “When & where ads showed.”\nMake sure you’re targeting locations where you have a store/branch and locations where you can deliver (if relevant)\nExclude locations where you can’t sell or where the demographic doesn’t match your target audience \n9. Review and Adjust Your Bids\n\nReviewing your bidding strategy and current performance can help you understand how to adjust your bids to maximize ROI. \n\nAutomated bidding is often a good idea for those just starting out. But you may be able to see better performance later on if you switch to manual bidding. \n\nIf you want to manually adjust your bids, evaluate at least three months’ worth of your PPC campaign data. \n\nAssess different bid factors (e.g., how well mobile ads are performing for a specific campaign or ad group) to identify where you need to increase or decrease your bids.\n\nIn Google Ads, you can adjust your bids based on:\n\nDevice\nLocation\nSchedule\nCall interactions\nDemographics (age, gender, and household income)\n\nIf you have a Google Ads advanced account, you can also make bid adjustments for:\n\nTargeting methods (i.e., Search Network vs. Display Network)\nRemarketing lists\n10. Find Wasted Spend\n\nThe ultimate goal of a PPC audit is to save money—both by maximizing returns and eliminating wasted spend. \n\nBig fixes that come from your audit will obviously save money. But you can also identify small changes to make right away for quick savings. \n\nSo, make sure you’ve accounted for the following best practices: \n\nAds are scheduled to display during prime conversion times\nMobile ads are optimized to display on mobile\nLanguage targeting matches your customer base\nYour home and office IPs are excluded\nDelivery method is set to standard (not accelerated)\n\nOther actions you can take to save extra money on your PPC campaigns include:\n\nTargeting a smaller geographic area to reach your most relevant customers\nLowering your bids on ads that get lots of clicks\nChanging your keyword match type to broad match\nOptimizing negative keywords so you aren’t blocking relevant traffic or bringing in irrelevant traffic\nChanging your ad rotation setting to “Optimize” so ads that are expected to perform well are prioritized \nRun Frequent PPC Audits & Optimize Your Ads\n\nIt’s a good idea to run paid search audits at least every six months. Or every time you start managing a new account. \n\nAnd know that ads can always be further optimized. Especially if you’re leveraging tools like Advertising Research.\n\nOptimize Your Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
