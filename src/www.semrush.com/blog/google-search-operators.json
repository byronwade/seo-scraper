  "content": "What Are Google Search Operators?\n\nGoogle search operators are special commands you can use to find more specific information in Google.\n\nLike this:\n\nThe “site:” operator allows you to search for results from a specific website.\n\nIn this example, including “site:semrush.com” in your search query will show results only from semrush.com.\n\nMany other Google search operators can make your search results more precise. They also have many practical uses for SEO.\n\nIn this post, we’ll guide you through different search operators. And show you how to use them for SEO activities. Such as:\n\nBuilding internal links\nFinding websites for guest posting\nFinding site indexing issues\n\nLet's get started.\n\nList of 35+ Google Search Operators\n\nHere are the search operators Google supports:\n\nintitle:\n\nSearches for pages that contain a specific word in the title tag. \n\nTry it out: intitle:pizza\n\nThis will show pages with the word “pizza” in the title tag.\n\nallintitle:\n\nWorks like “intitle'' but will only show pages where the title tag includes all of the specified words.\n\nTry it out: allintitle:pizza recipe\n\nrelated:\n\nAllows you to find sites related to a particular domain. \n\nTry it out: related:nytimes.com\n\nGooglewill show other news media sites related to nytimes.com.\n\nOR\n\nFinds results related to one of two search terms. In some cases, results will contain both search terms. \n\nTry it out: pizza OR pasta\n\nThis will show pages that are related to either pizza or pasta. Or both.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the pipe (|) operator in place of “OR.” It does the same thing.\n\nTry it out: pizza | pasta\n\nAND\n\nFinds results related to both the searched terms.\n\nTry it out: pizza AND pasta\n\nThe AND operator is usually implied in Google search queries. When entering multiple search terms, Google assumes you want to see results that include all of those terms.\n\nSo if you search for “pizza pasta,” Google will show results that include both “pizza” and “pasta” anyway.\n\n-\n\nThe minus (-) operator excludes a particular term or phrase and shows pages that don’t include the excluded term (or terms).\n\nTry it out: digital marketing -jobs\n\nGoogle will show pages related to “digital marketing,” but not “digital marketing jobs.”\n\n()\n\nThe parentheses “()” groups multiple terms or search operators to influence the final search.\n\nTry it out: Tesla (Model S OR Model Y)\n\nGoogle will show pages that either include “Model S” or “Model Y” in addition to “Tesla.”\n\n*\n\nActs as a wild card and fills in the missing word or phrase.\n\nTry it out: best * in Paris\n\nGoogle will fill in the asterisk with different words, such as “places,” “museums,” “hotels,” “restaurants,” “tourist places,” etc.\n\ndefine:\n\nSee the definition for a specific word or concept. The definition is displayed in a special dictionary box, but sometimes Google might just show websites that define the term for you.\n\nTry it out: define:algorithm\n\nThis will serve the definition of the word “algorithm.”\n\nfiletype:\n\nFind results of a particular file format (e.g., PDF, XLS, PPT, DOCX, etc.)\n\nTry it out: filetype:pdf climate change\n\nYou’ll see search results for PDF files related to climate change.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the “ext:” operator in place of “filetype:” It does the same thing.\n\nTry it out: ext:pdf climate change\n\ncache:\n\nAllows you to view the most recent cached version of a webpage.\n\nTry it out: cache:semrush.com\n\nGoogle will show you the most recent cached version of our homepage.\n\nsite:\n\nFinds results from a specific website.\n\nTry it out: site:nytimes.com\n\nYou’ll see results only from nytimes.com.\n\ninurl:\n\nFinds pages that include a specific word in the URL.\n\nTry it out: inurl:shampoo\n\nThis will return pages that have the word “shampoo” in the URL.\n\nallinurl:\n\nWorks like “inurl” but will only return pages where the URL includes all of the specified terms.\n\nTry it out: allinurl:best baby shampoos\n\nweather:\n\nAllows you to quickly see weather conditions for a particular location.\n\nTry it out: weather:london\n\nGoogle will display the current temperature, forecast, and other weather-related information.\n\nmap:\n\nShows a map of a specific location.\n\nTry it out: map:new york\n\nGoogle will display a map of the location. If you click on the map, it will take you to Google Maps. Where you can zoom in or zoom out and explore further.\n\nmovie:\n\nShows information about a specific movie.\n\nTry it out: movie:avengers endgame\n\nGoogle will display movie-related information. Like reviews, ratings, full cast and crew list, trailers, and showtimes (if it’s currently in theaters near you).\n\nstocks:\n\nAllows you to quickly see stock prices and other financial information of a particular company.\n\nTry it out: stocks:tesla\n\nGoogle will show the stock price, current market cap, stock chart with historic price details, and other relevant information. \n\nintext:\n\nLooks for pages that contain a specific word in the content.\n\nTry it out: intext:AI\n\nThis will return pages that have the word “AI” somewhere within the content.\n\nallintext:\n\nWorks like “intext” but will only show pages where page content contains all of the specified words.\n\nTry it out: allintext:SEO tips\n\nGoogle will show pages with both words in the content.\n\nsource:\n\nFinds news articles from a specific source in Google News.\n\nTry it out: tesla source:nytimes.com\n\nYou’ll see news articles about Tesla from The New York Times.\n\nin\n\nLets you convert one unit to another. Applies to currency, weights, distance, temperature, time, etc. \n\nFor example, you can search for “999 USD in EUR” to see how much $999 USD is worth in euros.\n\nTry it out: 999 usd in eur\n\n“search term”\n\nUsing quotation marks around a search query allows you to search for an exact phrase rather than individual words.\n\nTry it out: “best pizza in new york city”\n\nIn this example, Google will only show results that include that exact phrase, rather than “best,” “pizza,” and “new york city” separately.\n\nAROUND(X)\n\nSearches for pages where two words appear within the distance of “X” words from each other.\n\nTry it out: Tesla AROUND(5) Model S\n\nIn this example, Google will return pages with words “Tesla” and “Model S” in content where they appear within five words from each other.\n\nlocation:\n\nNarrow your results to a specific location. \n\nTry it out: location:seattle pizza\n\nYou’ll see pizza-related results specific to Seattle.\n\nUnreliable & Deprecated Search Operators\n\nGoogle search operators have been in use for years.\n\nBut did you know Google has terminated some operators? Or that some operators don’t work as effectively as they used to?\n\nLet’s look at the non-working Google search operators. As well as the ones that return inconsistent results and shouldn’t be relied on.\n\nblogurl:\n\nFind all of a domain's blog URLs. The operator was useful for performing searches in Google Blog Search, which was shut down in 2011.\n\nExample: blogurl:semrush.com\n\nAlthough this operator has been deprecated, it still returns a few relevant results in a regular Google search. \n\n#..#\n\nSearch for information within a specific range of numbers. For example, if you want to find articles about the best ’90s movies, you can use “best movies 1990..1999” as your search query.\n\nExample: best movies 1990..1999\n\nOur testing found that this operator returns mixed results by displaying movies for the years 1990 to 1999 but also 2000 and beyond.\n\ninanchor:\n\nAllowed you to find webpages that have links pointing to them using a specific anchor text. \n\nFor example, if you want to find webpages that have links pointing to them with the anchor text “books,” you can use “inanchor:books” as your search query.\n\nExample: inanchor:books\n\nNote: The operator no longer consistently returns relevant results.\n\nallinanchor:\n\nWorks like “inanchor” but would only return pages where a link’s anchor text contains all specified words.\n\nExample: allinanchor:best books 2024\n\nNote: The operator doesn’t seem to work. You’ll often see false positives.\n\n+\n\nFind pages that mention a specific word or phrase exactly as written.\n\nFor example, if you search for “Semrush +team,” Google will only show you pages that have the words “Semrush” and “team” together. And not pages that have “Semrush” and “team” separately or in a different order.\n\nExample: Semrush +team\n\nNote: The “+” operator has been discontinued by Google. You can use quotation marks to find webpages that contain exact matches.\n\n#\n\nSee blogs, social media posts, and news articles that used a specific #hashtag.\n\nExample: #throwbackfriday\n\nNote: This one doesn’t seem to work. It often returns false positives.\n\n~\n\nFinds pages that contain synonyms for a word or phrase.\n\nFor example, if you search for “~healthy recipes,” Google will show pages that contain words or phrases related to healthy recipes, such as nutritious recipes, low-fat recipes, wholesome recipes, etc. \n\nExample: ~healthy recipes\n\nNote: Google has terminated this operator. For most searches, Google automatically shows pages that include synonyms. \n\nlink:\n\nSearch for webpages that link to a specific URL. For example, if you search for “link:nytimes.com,” Google will show all webpages that link to The New York Times website.\n\nExample: link:nytimes.com\n\nNote: Google has deprecated this operator, as confirmed by Google’s Gary Illyes on Twitter. It doesn’t return relevant results.\n\ninfo:\n\nFind more information about a specific URL or domain. Like a cached version, similar sites, links to the site, etc.\n\nExample: info:semrush.com\n\nNote: Google has terminated this operator.\n\ndaterange:\n\nAllows you to search for content that was published within a specific date range. The date range must be specified in Julian format.\n\nExample: daterange:23001-23091 SEO\n\nNote: We’ve found that this operator no longer works.\n\ninpostauthor:\n\nSearch for content written by a specific author. \n\nExample: inpostauthor:Neil Gaiman\n\nThis operator used to work in Google Blog Search, which was retired in 2011. It doesn’t work in regular Google Search. \n\nphonebook:\n\nFind a person’s phone number.\n\nExample: phonebook:elon musk\n\nGoogle has discontinued “phonebook:” search operator, as confirmed by a former Google employee in a blog post.\n\ninposttitle:\n\nLook for blog posts with specific words in the title. \n\nExample: inposttitle:SEO tips\n\nThis operator was useful for finding relevant blog posts in Google Blog Search. It doesn’t work in regular Google Search.\n\nHow to Use Google Advanced Search Operators for SEO\n\nGoogle search operators are useful for various SEO tasks. Like:\n\nBuilding internal links\nFinding site indexing issues\nFinding websites for guest posting\n\nLet’s explore the use cases in more detail.\n\n1. Get Internal Linking Ideas\n\nInternal links are hyperlinks that connect one page on a website to another page on the same website.\n\nThey’re important for SEO for three main reasons:\n\nInternal links help users discover more content on your site\nThey help search engines crawl and index your site more efficiently\nThey can spread link equity (ranking power) throughout your website\n\nTo give your SEO a boost, regularly check your website for internal linking opportunities. And add links where relevant.\n\nGoogle search parameters can help you generate internal linking ideas.\n\nFor example, if we want to add internal links to this guide, we can search Google with search operators like this:\n\nGoogle will show relevant articles where we mention the phrase “Google search operators” somewhere in the content. So we can add internal links from them.\n\n2. Find Site Indexation Issues\n\nIndexation is the process whereby Google stores your website pages in its search index—a database containing billions of webpages.\n\nYour webpages must be indexed by Google to appear in search results.\n\nAnd to get traffic from Google.\n\nGoogle search operators can check whether your website pages are indexed.\n\nUse the “site:” search operator.\n\nFor example, if you want to check the index status of techcrunch.com, search for “site:techcrunch.com.”\n\nThis tells you roughly how many of the site’s pages Google has indexed.\n\nNote: These are approximations. If you want to know exactly how many pages of your site Google has indexed, check Google Search Console.\n\nYou can also review whether specific pages are indexed by searching the page URL with “site:” search.\n\nThis is helpful to confirm whether Google has indexed the new articles you’ve published on your website.\n\nFor example, we recently published a new guide to learning SEO.\n\nTo confirm whether Google has indexed it, we can search for “site:semrush.com/blog/learn-seo/”\n\nAs you can see, the page appears in Google search results. Which means there are likely no indexation issues.\n\n3. Find Websites for Guest Posting\n\nGuest posting is where you write blog posts for other websites in your niche to promote your brand. \n\nMany SEO marketers also use guest posting to build links to their site, according to a recent Twitter poll.\n\nTo find relevant guest posting opportunities for your website, search Google with one of these search operators:\n\nYour keyword intitle:“write for us”\nYour keyword intitle:“become an author”\nYour keyword intitle:”contribute”\nYour keyword intitle:“guest article”\nYour keyword intitle:“submit a post”\nYour keyword intitle:“submit an article”\n\nThese operators will return sites that accept guest posts within your niche.\n\nFor example, if we want to find guest posting opportunities for health and fitness websites, we’ll search Google like this:\n\nAnd it will show websites accepting guest posts.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use the “inurl:” search operator.\n\nYour keyword inurl:“write for us”\nYour keyword inurl:“become an author”\nYour keyword inurl:”contribute”\nYour keyword inurl:“guest article”\nYour keyword inurl:“submit a post”\nYour keyword inurl:“submit an article”\n4. Find Non-Secure Pages on Your Domain\n\nAny pages on your website that are still using HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) are not secure for visitors.\n\nTheir sensitive information like password and credit details can potentially be intercepted and stolen by hackers.\n\nThat’s why it’s important to switch to HTTPS (HTTP secure). Which is also a ranking factor for Google.\n\nTo find non-secure pages on your website, combine the “site:” and “-inurl:” operators. \n\nLike this:\n\nLet’s deconstruct the Google search syntax we’re using.\n\nHere, we’re using:\n\nThe “site:” operator so Google looks at your entire website\nThen the exclusionary “-inurl:” operator so it only shows non-secure pages (still using HTTP)\n\nThis should reveal any non-secure pages you may have on your site.\n\nAlternatively, Semrush’s Site Audit tool can identify non-secure pages. \n\nSet up a project in the tool and audit your website.\n\nAfter the audit is complete, go to the “Issues” tab and search for “non-secure.” The tool will show if it detected any non-secure pages.\n\n5. Find Resource Pages for Link Building\n\nResource pages are webpages that curate and link out to useful industry resources. Like articles or tools.\n\nHere’s what a resource page looks like:\n\nReach out to the people who created the resource page and suggest your resource for inclusion.\n\nIf they decide to add it, you could potentially receive a backlink as well.\n\nBut how do you find websites that curate resource pages?\n\nGoogle search operators can help.\n\nSearch Google with one of these Google search strings:\n\nYour keyword intitle:resources\nYour keyword intitle:links\nYour keyword inurl:resources\nYour keyword inurl:links\n\nAll these operators will return sites that curate and link out to relevant resources in your niche.\n\nFor example, if we want to find resource page opportunities for personal finance websites, we’ll search Google like this:\n\nAnd it will show websites curating resources.\n\n6. Track Down Duplicate Content Issues\n\nDuplicate content is when the exact same content appears on the web in more than one place. \n\nIt could be on your website: Two or more pages on your website display the same content.\n\nOr someone else’s website: Some other website copy-and-pasted your content on their site.\n\nThat’s bad.\n\nLuckily, search operators can help you find duplicate content issues.\n\nTo see whether anyone has duplicated your content, use Google operators like this:\n\nHere, we’re using the exclusionary “-site:” operator so results from your own site aren’t included. \n\nThen the quotation marks (“”) to see if your exact sentence or block of text appears anywhere else on the web.\n\nIf you notice your content is duplicated elsewhere, reach out to those sites and make sure they link back to your site with proper attribution.\n\nNow, to find duplicate content on your own website, use the following operators.\n\nWe’re using the “site:” operator to return results for your site only.\n\nThen the quotation marks (“”) to see if there are multiple matching results present.\n\nAlso, Semrush’s Site Audit tool can find duplicate content issues and save you from manual search work.\n\nSet up a project in the tool and run a full crawl of your site. \n\nOnce the crawl is complete, navigate to the “Issues” tab. Then, search for “duplicate content.”\n\nThe tool will show if you have duplicate content on your own site. \n\nClick on the “# pages” link to see a full list of pages with duplicate content. Then click on the “Why and how to fix it” button at the top of the page to get advice on how to fix it.\n\n7. Find Files You Don’t Want to Keep in Google’s Index\n\nIf you use special content assets (PDF files, Excel spreadsheet templates, etc.) as your lead magnets, you probably don’t want them appearing in Google search results.\n\nThat’s because users can freely access them without exchanging their contact information with your business.\n\nThis could lead to a decrease in lead generation and sales.\n\nTo check whether Google has indexed your lead magnet files, use the “site:” and “filetype:” operators.\n\nLike this:\n\nIf you see that your lead magnet files are in Google’s index, remove them by adding the “noindex” attribute.\n\nNew to the “noindex” attribute? Read our full guide to meta robots and x-robots-tag to get started.\n\n8. Search Outreach Prospects’ Social Media Profiles\n\nMany of the most useful link building strategies revolve around outreach.\n\nIt’s where you contact website owners—via social media, email, etc.—and give them a compelling reason to link to your content.\n\nUse Google search operators to find your prospects’ social media profiles.\n\nHere’re the search operators you can use:\n\nIn this example, we’re using the parentheses () to group multiple operators together. \n\nThen the “OR” operator to trigger your prospect’s profiles on any of the specified social media platforms.\n\nSo you can contact them there.\n\nMaster the Google Search Operators List\n\nLearning how to use Google search commands is a skill. It takes time and practice to master. \n\nBut the benefits are well worth the effort.\n\nWith Google search modifiers, you can narrow your search and filter out unwanted or irrelevant results.\n\nThese operators also help you carry out regular SEO activities.\n\nTo help you master Google search operators, we’ve put together a downloadable cheat sheet.\n\nIt’s a handy reference guide to the most useful search operators. \n\nDownload our cheat sheet and start mastering Google search operators today.",
