Website\n\nA website is the online representation of your business or brand. \n\nIt’s where you showcase your products, services, values, and personality to potential customers. To attract, engage, and convert your audience.\n\nFor example, here is Semrush’s website homepage:\n\nIt represents the Semrush brand. And tells visitors exactly what they can do with a subscription.\n\nWebsites are also great digital marketing channels because they can:\n\nBuild credibility and authority in your niche\nIncrease the visibility and reach of your content\nProvide a platform to communicate and interact with your audience\nCollect data and feedback from visitors\nAllow for more versatile marketing campaigns\nHow to Get Started with Your Website\n\nBefore you design your website, you need to understand who your audience is and what they want.\n\nYou need to know about their demographics, preferences, pain points, and goals. \n\nA great way to start gathering this information with One2Target. Just enter your domain and you’ll get tons of data about your visitors. \n\nThe second step is to design your website with your audience in mind. \n\nLuckily, hosting and website-building sites like Wix and WordPress have ready-made templates you can adjust to suit your audience.\n\nMeaning you can have a user-friendly website within seconds. And just optimize it for your unique style.\n\nWhen doing so, pay close attention to the following website elements:\n\nStructure: How your website is organized and laid out. You want to make it easy for your visitors to navigate pages and find what they’re looking for.\nContent: What your website says and shows. You want to provide valuable and engaging information that answers your visitors’ questions and solves their problems. \nStyle: How your website looks and feels. You want to create a consistent and appealing visual identity for your website that reflects your brand personality and values. \n\nAnd the third step is to test and optimize your site for your target audience. \n\nMeasure how your site performs and how your visitors interact with your site with tools like Google Search Console or Site Audit. And then use the data collected to make small changes that speak to your audience even better.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nTarget Audience: What It Is & How to Find Yours [+ Examples]\nHow to Build Your Website Architecture for SEO\n\nGet In-Depth Audience Behavior Insights\n\nwith Semrush One2Target Audience Research\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\n\nSEO is the process of improving your site’s visibility in search engines. It can help you drive more organic (unpaid) traffic, leads, and sales.\n\nSEO is one of the most effective digital channels because it helps you reach your target audience when they’re looking for the products or services you offer.\n\nFor example, investment firm Charles Schwab created a landing page targeting the keyword “Roth IRA.”\n\nThe landing page is optimized using secondary keywords like “what is a Roth IRA” and “why consider a Roth IRA,” among other things.\n\nAnd that page ranks number one on Google. With a featured snippet, at that.\n\nSo anyone looking up Roth IRAs will probably see and click on the link to Charles Schwab’s landing page.\n\nWhich is probably why the page gets around 327K organic visitors per month, according to the Organic Research tool.\n\nGet Organic Traffic Data\n\nwith the Organic Research tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Get Started with SEO\n\nHere are three steps to get started with SEO:\n\nDo Keyword Research\n\nKeywords are the words and phrases users type into search engines.\n\nYour first step to effective SEO is to find which keywords your target audience is using to search for products or services like yours.\n\nYou can use keyword research tools like the Keyword Magic Tool to discover and analyze keywords. \n\nStart by choosing keywords with high search volume, low competition, and high relevance for your website.\n\nFurther reading: How to Do Keyword Research for SEO (A Detailed 3-Step Guide)\n\nOptimize for On-Page SEO\n\nThe second step is to optimize your pages for your target keywords. \n\nOn-page SEO is the practice of crafting your content to match searcher intent. I.e., turning your content into what searchers want to see when they search for a specific keyword.\n\nAnd optimizing some technical aspects of your pages to make them more user-friendly for visitors.\n\nYou can use a tool like On-Page SEO Checker to crawl your site and get optimization ideas.\n\nLike this:\n\nCommon tasks associated with on-page SEO involve optimizing aspects of your content such as: \n\nTitle tags: Title tags are the clickable headlines that can appear on the search engine results pages (SERPs). Include your target keyword and a compelling value proposition in title tags.\nMeta descriptions: Meta descriptions are snippets of text that can appear below the title tags on the SERPs. Include your target keyword and a clear call to action in meta descriptions.\nHeadings: Headings are words or phrases that structure your pages. Use headings to organize content and include your target keyword and related keywords in your headings.\nContent: Content is the main text and images that convey your message and offer on your pages. Create content that is valuable, engaging, and relevant for your target keyword and audience. \nURLs: URLs are the web addresses that identify your pages. Create URLs that are short and descriptive. And include your target keyword.\n\nFurther reading: On-Page SEO: What It Is and How to Do It\n\nOptimize for Off-Page SEO \n\nOff-page SEO is the practice of increasing a website’s popularity and reputation through external factors, such as links, local SEO, and reviews. \n\nWhich means that the third step is to build your website’s authority and trustworthiness. \n\nYou’ll want to focus on aspects such as:\n\nBacklinks: Backlinks are links from other websites that point to yours. They’re like votes of confidence for your website. Which is why pages with lots of high quality backlinks often rank higher on Google. Try to get backlinks from high-quality and relevant websites that have authority and trust in your niche.\nLocal SEO: Local SEO blends both on-page and off-page optimization. It involves using the Google Business Profile, reviews, local citations, and other key features to rank in Google’s map results.

Email Marketing\n\nEmail marketing is the process of sending targeted messages to your audience via email. And it’s a very effective digital marketing channel. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause email marketing lets you connect with customers and prospects in a personal, timely, and affordable way.\n\nFor example, Monos emails their customers when they’ve left something in their cart.

Paid Advertising\n\nPaid advertising is a type of digital marketing channel that involves paying to display ads to a targeted audience on different online platforms. \n\nHere is what paid ads look like on Google.\n\nCompanies pay to show up first on the search results page for relevant keywords. Which is why there’s a “Sponsored” tag above each ad.\n\nTwo common paid ad models are pay-per-click (PPC) and cost per impression (CPM). Both can be cost effective since you only pay every time someone clicks on or sees your ad.\n\nUnlike organic marketing, where you create content and optimize your site for search engines, paid advertising lets you reach potential customers faster and more directly.\n\nAmong many other things, paid advertising is important because it can help you:\n\nDrive more highly targeted traffic to specific pages\nTest and optimize your marketing messages and offers\nTarget specific audience segments based on demographics, interests, behaviors, and locations\nRetarget people who visited your site but didn’t take action\nTrack and measure your return on investment (ROI) and performance\nHow to Get Started with Paid Ads\n\nTo get started with paid advertising, first choose the platforms that match your goals, budget, and audience. \n\nOne of the most popular is Google Ads. \n\nIt lets you show your ads on Google’s search results, as well as on millions of websites that are part of the Google Display Network.\n\nWhich means your ads can appear on websites like this:\n\nPlus, you can also use Google Ads to create video ads on YouTube, shopping ads on Google Shopping, and app ads on Google Play.\n\nOther paid advertising platforms include Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and X Ads. \n\nOnce you know where you want to run ads, do a bit of competitive research. Especially for Google Ads. \n\nOpen Advertising Research, enter a competitor’s domain, and click “Search.” \n\nThe “Positions” tab will show the keywords they’re bidding on and the target URLs. \n\nClick the “Ad Copies” tab. You’ll see the exact ads they’re running. And the keywords that trigger those ads. \n\nThen, you can head to the “Competitors” tab to discover new rivals. \n\nRepeat this tactic for each of your main competitors. And use the insights to get more out of your marketing efforts. \n\nFinally, create your ad.\n\nYou can use Canva to create the image for your ad. Or use AdCreative.ai to generate one with AI.\n\nAnd then either write the copy manually or get help from AI with the free Social Media Post Generator.\n\nGet more in-depth knowledge about paid ads by checking out Sermrush’s guides (listed below).\n\nFurther reading:\n\nOnline Advertising: All You Need to Know\nWhat Is Retargeting and How Does It Work?\n\nUncover Your Competitors’ Search Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n7.

It can help you educate customers, increase engagement, boost conversions, and reach decision-makers faster.\n\nAnd it’s one of the most effective digital marketing channels.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it’s multi-sensory and emotionally engaging. Meaning it can capture attention and convey information better than text or images.\n\nFor example, DJI introduces new products on YouTube. And gets thousands to over a million views on their videos.\n\nWhich can equate to tons of potential customers.\n\nHow to Start Reaching Customers with Video Marketing\n\nTo start with video marketing, you need to have a clear goal, a defined audience, and a compelling story. \n\nYou also need to choose the right type of video for your purpose, such as explainer videos, testimonial videos, live videos, or sponsored videos. \n\nTip\n\nUse tools like VideoForm or Vidyard to create videos easily. \n\nYou can have videos on your website, but you can also share them on the platforms where your audience is, such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. \n\nAnd finally, you need to measure your video performance and optimize your strategy based on the results.\n\nHere are some tips to make your video marketing more effective:\n\nHook your audience in the first few seconds with a catchy title, thumbnail, and introduction\nTell stories that connect with your audience and showcase your personality, values, and benefits\nEvoke positive emotions and inspire action \nMake your videos “sticky” by adding elements of surprise, curiosity, or humor\nRely on visuals and soundtracks to enhance your message and appeal to different senses\nKeep your videos concise, clear, and relevant to your goal and audience\n\nVideo marketing is a powerful way to grow your brand and business in 2024 and beyond. \n\nBy following these steps and tips, you can create engaging and effective video content that can help you reach more customers and drive more business.\n\nFurther reading: Video SEO: How to Get Your Videos to Rank\n\n8.

These are the people who love your product or service, have a large or relevant network, and are willing to share their experiences with others. You can use surveys, feedback forms, reviews, or social media to find them.\nCreate a referral program. Create a program that is easy to use, attractive, and rewarding for both the referrer and the referred. You can use tools like Impact or PartnerStack to create and manage your program. Then, decide the incentives you’ll offer, such as discounts, free products, cash, etc.\nPromote your program and ask for referrals. Make your referral program visible and accessible to your customers. And remind them of the benefits. You can use email, social media, your website, or other channels to promote your program. Use testimonials, case studies, or stories to show how your referral program works and how it helps.\nTrack and improve your referral program performance. Monitor and analyze your program’s results, such as the number of referrals, conversions, revenue, and ROI. Use feedback and data to optimize and improve your referral program over time.\n9.
