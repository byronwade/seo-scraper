  "content": "SEO audit tools are vital to any search engine marketing tool stack. \n\nThe best tools can help you easily identify the issues hurting your site's performance in search results. \n\nWhether you’re a site owner, SEO professional, or content manager, you can leverage these tools to prioritize the most urgent fixes for your site. You’ll also help boost rankings, generate more traffic, and capture more conversions. \n\nLet’s jump right into the best tools for the job.\n\nThe 10 Best SEO Audit Tools\n\nEvery website needs a regular checkup. Think of it like preventative care—audits let you take care of minor issues before they can become major problems. \n\nPlus, audit tools will recommend easy ways to maintain or improve your current rankings, helping your site get more exposure and traffic year-round. \n\nHere are our topic picks for the best SEO audit tools. \n\n1. Semrush Site Audit Tool\n\nThe Semrush Site Audit tool makes it easy to run an SEO audit and fix over 140 potential issues.\n\nThe Site Audit report breaks down the full SEO audit into seven thematic reports:\n\nCrawlability: Page indexability, crawl budget optimization, crawl depth, and more\nHTTPS: Secure vs. non-secure pages and security certificates\nInternational SEO: Hreflang implementation\nCore Web Vitals (CWV): Largest Contentful Paint, Total Blocking Time, and Cumulative Layout Shift\nSite performance: Page load speed, load time, file size, redirects, JavaScript, and CSS reports\nInternal linking: Internal link distribution, broken internal links and external links, and anchor text optimization\nMarkup: Structured data, Schema.org markup, Open Graph data, Twitter cards, and microformats\n\nTo run a website audit using Site Audit, follow these steps:\n\nFrom Semrush, click “Site Audit” under “On Page & Tech SEO.”\n\nType in the URL of the website you want to audit. Click “Start Audit.”\n\nNote: If you already have a project set up in Semrush, you’ll need to click “+ Create project” to add a new project and run a new audit.\n\nThen, from the “Site Audit Settings” box, choose the number of pages you want to check in your audit and click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nYou can crawl up to 100 pages with a free account. With a Pro account, you can crawl up to 20,000 per audit and up to 100,000 per month. \n\nPro tip: Once you’re comfortable running Site Audit, you can customize crawl and output in settings. \n\nLet the report run. It will take some time for the Site Audit crawl bot to check your pages, content, images, and links. \n\nWhen it’s finished, you’ll receive a report like the one below. You’ll also see a list of the top issues.\n\nClick “Number of issues” for any of these items to see a detailed list of the uncovered SEO errors or issues.\n\nIf you’re unsure of where to start, look at the prioritization widgets at the top of the report.\n\nThis section breaks issues down into three categories:\n\nErrors: Highest-severity issues you should address immediately\nWarnings: Medium-severity issues you should address as soon as you can\nNotices: Not considered issues and may not require any action—this is more for user awareness. \n\nThis will help you easily prioritize the most critical issues before they become major headaches. \n\nFind and Fix Sitemap Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Semrush On Page SEO Checker\n\nUse the Semrush On Page SEO Checker tool to generate a comprehensive list of improvements to your site's on-page SEO. \n\nThis tool analyzes pages, content, and competitors and provides data-driven recommendations like:\n\nIdeas for improving your content\nOpportunities to earn backlinks\nFeatured snippet and SERP feature opportunities\nSemantically related keywords you can add to existing content\n\nThis tool allows you to import specific URLs or keywords on your website and receive customized, data-driven recommendations for improving your site’s SEO and performance. \n\nIt breaks down the recommendations into seven groups:\n\nStrategy ideas: Pages that already rank for your desired keywords and how to better optimize them to get even more traffic, and keyword cannibalization issues (when two or more pages are competing for the same keywords)\nBacklink ideas: Website recommendations that may be a good fit for link partnerships or collaborations to help improve your site’s rankings \nUser experience ideas: Recommendations for areas of your website that could benefit from an improved user experience\nTechnical SEO ideas: Issues related to metadata, title tags, crawlability, and other common problems\nSERP features ideas: Opportunities to target SERP features like featured snippets and reviews, which can help you capture additional real estate in the search results\nSemantic ideas: Additional topic and keyword suggestions that could enhance the quality and depth of your content\nContent ideas: Suggestions for optimizing your content to better rank in search engine results\n\nHere’s how to use On Page SEO Checker: \n\nInside Semrush, click “On Page SEO Checker” under “On Page & Tech SEO.”\n\nNow, enter the website you want to analyze and click “Get ideas.”\n\nNote: If you already have a project set up in Semrush, you’ll need to click “+ Create project” to add a new project and run a new report.\n\nNext, you’ll see the “Select target location” dialog box. \n\nHere, you can modify variables that impact how Semrush views your site for the analysis. Click the drop-down to choose a location, language, and device that matches how you want to audit your site. Then click “Continue.”\n\nPro tip: Need help determining which settings to select? Leave the drop-down as the default setting and click “Continue.” \n\nYou’ll see the “Add pages to optimize” screen. This is where you’ll select the pages you want to audit and provide target keywords. \n\nStart by reviewing the options under “Auto import.” You can remove any automatically suggested options by clicking the remove button that looks like a trash can. \n\nAdd your pages to the analysis by clicking the “Manually” tab at the top of the screen. Then, type or paste the URL of the page you want to analyze and your target keyword. Click “Add Page.”\n\nPro tip: You can upload a file to add a list of URLs, pull URLs from Google Search Console, or use the Organic Research option to help you find pages to analyze using the other tabs at the top.\n\nOnce you’ve selected the relevant pages you want to analyze, click “Collect ideas.”\n\nNow, the On Page SEO Checker will analyze your selected pages. Once the audit is complete, you’ll see the On Page SEO Checker report page.\n\nTo dig into the suggestions provided, click the number next to one of the categories listed under “Total Ideas.” Or click the number of ideas shown for a specific page under the “TOP pages to optimize” section.\n\nOnce you’ve clicked into the report, you’ll see a detailed list of specific ideas for each page, broken down into seven categories. Each one contains an action item and information on how to address an issue or implement an idea. \n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Google Search Console \n\nIf you’re looking for free SEO audit tools, Google Search Console (GSC) is a great option. It provides you with data from Google about your site's crawlability, indexability, and search performance. \n\nThis information will help you address any issues and optimize your site. \n\nHowever, GSC is not as comprehensive as other tools and won’t provide you with a list of action items or ideas like Site Audit and On Page SEO Checker. \n\nUsing the provided reports, you can see how your website is crawled and indexed by Google, the XML sitemaps it’s discovered, keyword rankings data, website speed and performance, and even backlink information. \n\nGSC data integrates directly with Google Analytics. The API also allows you to pull the data into many third-party tools, including the Semrush On Page SEO Checker. \n\n4. Google PageSpeed Insights\n\nYour site’s load speed, performance, and usability affect your rankings. Learn what search engines and users experience on your site with the free SEO audit tool PageSpeed Insights.\n\nYou can use the analysis and detailed suggestions to resolve website performance problems and improve user experience and rankings. \n\nPageSpeed Insights assesses the performance of a webpage for both desktop and mobile devices. It provides a score indicating performance, with suggestions on how to improve page speed. \n\nUsing PageSpeed insights, you can understand the following metrics:\n\nFirst Contentful Paint (FCP)\nSpeed Index (SI)\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)\nTime to Interactive (TTI)\nTotal Blocking Time (TBT)\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n\nThe tool suggests ways to improve site performance, such as eliminating render-blocking resources, minimizing HTML and CSS file sizes, optimizing images, and more.\n\nPageSpeed Insights provides an API to pull the data into many other tools, including Looker Studio.\n\n5. JetOctopus\n\nJetOctopus is a scalable audit tool used primarily for large websites. Rather than crawl limits, they offer unit pricing based on the size of your website (number of pages). \n\nIn addition to traditional website audits, they also offer website log analysis to help uncover strange patterns or potential issues with your site’s crawlability or indexability.\n\nIt features:\n\nSEO Crawler: Detects technical issues that might hurt SEO performance, such as broken links, server errors, duplicate content, and more\nLog Analyzer: Looks through your website’s log files to understand how search engine bots (and other bots) interact with your website\nGSC Insights: Analyzes GSC data to identify insights, trends, and issues you can address\n6.

Integrations include DataBox, Supermetrics, and Whatagraph. \n\nYou can schedule regular crawls to run automatically. This tool is free for up to 5,000 pages. \n\n8.

Here’s a look at their biggest benefits. \n\nBetter Rankings and Traffic\n\nSEO audit tools help you identify and fix issues on your website that may impact SEO.\n\nFor example, they can help uncover issues like broken links to pages that no longer exist, missing H1 or title tags, and orphan pages that may not be crawlable by search engines. \n\nAny of these issues could cause your website to miss out on organic traffic—which means missing out on potential leads, customers, and revenue.\n\nBut SEO audit tools help you uncover these issues, understand how they impact your site, and teach you how to fix them.\n\nAudit tools also improve user experience by alerting you to slow pages, clickable elements that are too close together, and much more. \n\nEasy-to-Implement Solutions \n\nSEO issues can be complex, but audit tools help simplify them for users. \n\nThey help you track and fix a wide range of issues that could otherwise be difficult to understand or measure on your own.\n\nMany of these tools look at a variety of ranking factors and best practices, including:\n\nOn-page SEO: How the page’s code is structured, meta information, and the page content\nOff-page SEO: Number, quality, and quantity of backlinks\nTechnical SEO: Your site’s overall crawlability and indexability\nUser experience: How easy it is for the user to browse or use the website\nSite performance: Site load speed or load times, responsiveness, and other technical performance measurements\nMobile optimization: How easy the site is to use and navigate from a mobile device (phone, tablet, etc.)\nReal-Time Monitoring\n\nAudit tools provide real-time alerts to inform you if a website change creates an SEO issue you should fix.\n\nWithout regular audits, these problems could go unnoticed indefinitely, which could harm your rankings or create even worse issues over time. \n\nBut with audit tools, you’ll get notifications when these issues pop up, ensuring you can take action as soon as possible. \n\nActionable Tasks \n\nSEO audit tools help you understand which SEO issues are urgent and which ones can wait.\n\nIn each report, you’ll get an explanation of why the task is urgent and information on how to fix it. You can work through the tasks, starting with the ones that could have the greatest impact on your site, until you’ve addressed all errors. \n\nFixing these errors is an easy way to improve or maintain rankings and boost your site’s visibility in search engines.\n\nMust-Have SEO Audit Tool Features \n\nIf you’re considering using an audit tool, you’ll want to ensure it has the following features: \n\nOn-Page Website Analysis\n\nA great audit tool should analyze on-page SEO factors:\n\nMeta tags and metadata: Titles and descriptions\nInternal links: Broken links and quantity of links\nExternal links: Broken links and quantity and quality of links\nHeadings: H1, H2, etc.\nStructured data and markup: Proper use of Schema and Open Graph data\nContent quality: Thin pages or missing content\nTechnical SEO Analysis\n\nYou’ll want an audit tool that can perform deep technical SEO analysis, checking things like:\n\nCanonical URLs: Duplicate content and pages on your website\nRedirects (and chains or loops): Directives that send users and bots to pages other than the URL they’re visiting\nIndexing status: Which pages are visible and indexed by search engines\nSitemap health: The crawlability and accuracy of your sitemap files\nRobots.txt: Instructions for search engines on how to crawl and index your website\nSite structure: The size and shape of the pages on your site\nSite Performance Analysis\n\nAdditionally, your site’s speed and performance (e.g., page load speed) also affect SEO.\n\nIdeally, your SEO audit tool will benchmark your site on performance metrics that correlate with Google’s Core Web Vitals (CWV).\n\nFor example:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP): The time it takes to render the largest block of content on the page\nTotal Blocking Time (TBT): How long it takes for the page to become responsive to user input\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS): The physical distance the page’s content shifts in the browser while loading\nPrioritization\n\nLastly, a critical feature of an effective website audit tool is prioritization.\n\nThe tool should help you understand the severity and impact of the issues it uncovers so you can work strategically to resolve the most important problems. \n\nIt’s easy to become overwhelmed with hundreds or thousands of issues your site may face. Having a clear understanding of which ones to tackle first makes handling SEO issues much more manageable.\n\nSEO Audit Best Practices \n\nBefore you get started, you should know a few best practices for running SEO audits. \n\nPerform Audits Regularly\n\nDepending on how frequently you update your website and publish content, once per month or quarter is a good benchmark.\n\nSEO is a continuous process and regular auditing helps you identify new issues and fix them in a timely manner. \n\nUnderstand the Metrics\n\nSome of the metrics shown in an audit report are unique or proprietary to the tool you’re using. \n\nFor example, the Semrush Site Audit tool provides an overall “Site Health” score derived from the number of Errors and Warnings detected in the latest audit.\n\nTaking the time to understand each report’s metrics will help you make critical decisions about your site’s SEO.\n\nTake Advantage of Integrations\n\nIntegrations can make your audit more comprehensive by providing helpful data from third-party tools. \n\nMany SEO tools, including Semrush’s Site Audit and On Page SEO Checker, offer integrations with other platforms such as Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and Looker Studio.\n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →",
