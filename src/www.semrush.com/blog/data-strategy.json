  "content": "What Is Data Strategy?\n\nA data strategy is a comprehensive plan for handling an organization's data. It outlines technology, processes, and rules to manage data effectively. It also provides clear guidelines for acquiring, storing, distributing, and using data. \n\nWhy is this necessary?\n\nBecause businesses of all sizes collect and produce huge amounts of raw data. \n\nAn estimated 181 zettabytes of data will be generated worldwide by 2025. To put that into perspective, one zettabyte is roughly the equivalent of streaming Netflix continuously for 36 million years. \n\nThat’s a lot of data.\n\nImage Source: Statista\n\nManaging all this data, keeping it secure and compliant, and using it to drive business value can be challenging.\n\nAfter all, data is only useful if you can actually use it. Unfortunately, many businesses experience issues like silos and duplicates, and incomplete, inaccurate, or obsolete data. Or, even worse, a data breach.\n\nCreating a data strategy addresses these issues (and more) so businesses can use their data in meaningful ways and gain a competitive advantage.\n\nFurther reading: What Is Data-Driven Marketing, and Why Is It Important?\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of a Data Strategy?\n\nA solid data strategy plan is essential for most businesses today. Let’s explore the key benefits: \n\nSmarter Decision-Making \n\nAnalyzing trends and insights enables companies to understand what’s working, what’s not, and what could happen. This helps them make smarter, faster decisions. \n\nTo make more informed decisions, a company’s data strategy might include the following popular analytics model. It has three key elements: descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics.\n\nDescriptive Analytics\n\nDescriptive analytics involves analyzing historical data to understand what has happened in the past.\n\nFor example, a company might use Excel or Google Sheets to review sales data and identify seasonal changes. Or they might look at competitor data, like the number of visitors and traffic sources, using Semrush’s Traffic Analytics.\n\nFurther reading: What Is a Competitive Analysis and How Do You Conduct One?\n\nDiagnostic Analytics\n\nThis type of analytics delves into the reasons behind past events. \n\nLet’s say you notice some changes in your Google Ads performance and want to figure out why they’re happening. \n\nOur Advertising Research tool can help you monitor your rivals' pay-per-click (PPC) activities, including their ad spend and ad copy. You can use these insights to identify competitive trends and strategies that might influence your ad performance.\n\nPredictive Analytics\n\nPredictive analytics forecasts future events based on what has happened before. \n\nThis usually requires advanced statistical analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) technology. \n\nHistorical insights and future predictions enable the company to anticipate new trends and tailor its product development and marketing efforts.\n\nBetter Customer Experience\n\nData helps businesses understand how, when, where and what their customers like to buy. And what makes them tick. \n\nBrands can use customer data to:\n\nPersonalize key touchpoints, like the website and customer service channels\nOptimize products and experiences\nDo a better job of meeting customer needs\n\nFor example, brands can email customers when their favorite product comes back in stock or they’re due for a refill. Like pet food brand Chewy does here:\n\nThis helps boost customer loyalty and avoid missed sales.\n\nImproved Data Compliance and Security\n\nBrands handle large amounts of confidential customer data. Like names, addresses, and credit card information. \n\nFor example, let’s say you’re a regular shopper at Target and want to sign up for special deals and a birthday gift. They ask you for personal information, including your name, email address, and phone number.\n\nBrands have a responsibility to their customers to keep these details safe.\n\nDropping the ball on privacy and security can cost businesses a lot of time and money. According to IBM research, the global average cost of a data breach was $4.45 million. \n\nUnfortunately, data hacks and cybersecurity incidents happen all the time. In fact, the same IBM research showed that 51% of organizations planned to improve security due to a breach.\n\nA solid strategy helps businesses store and manage customer data securely so only authorized people can access it—for the intended purpose. \n\nIncreased Efficiency and Reduced Costs\n\nData can shine a spotlight on areas where businesses need to improve. \n\nSo they can:\n\nOptimize workflows\nImprove budgeting \nAdjust resource allocation\nSave costs\n\nWhat’s more, a data strategy can help businesses spot opportunities, like new revenue streams and business models. Which can further reduce costs and drive revenue.\n\nAdoption of Advanced Technologies\n\nOrganizations that use security AI and automation save $1.76 million compared to those that don’t. But to leverage these solutions and gain the benefits, businesses need clean, accurate, accessible data. \n\nAdvanced technologies like AI and ML use significant amounts of data. A data strategy helps ensure data meets the required quality standards so businesses can adopt new technologies and data models with confidence. \n\nTypes of Data Strategy\n\nOrganizations can adopt different data strategies based on their needs: centralized, decentralized, or hybrid.\n\nCentralized Data Strategy \n\nA centralized approach to data strategy involves one main “source of truth.” A single, central repository collects and stores data from multiple sources, like customer feedback and sales transaction records. \n\nThis approach ensures standardization and consistency of critical data like revenue, customer, and sales information. \n\nThis is especially beneficial for large organizations that must maintain uniformity across different departments. \n\nWhy? \n\nSo everyone works with the same, reliable data for performance assessment and decision-making.\n\nDecentralized Data Strategy \n\nA decentralized data strategy offers flexibility, with data distributed across multiple locations or servers. This approach suits organizations operating in a fast-changing environment or with independent departments with different data needs. \n\nFor instance, a startup with different project teams might prefer this for scalability and to avoid a single point of failure—meaning if one data source goes down, others remain functional, ensuring continuous data access.\n\nHybrid Data Strategy\n\nA hybrid data strategy combines centralized and decentralized approaches.\n\nFor example, in a company using a hybrid approach, the finance and marketing departments might rely on centralized data for creating monthly performance reports. This is the centralized aspect. Meanwhile, the finance department might also incorporate specific financial data exclusive to them. This is decentralized.\n\nA balanced approach lets companies maintain a single source of truth for overarching business metrics. At the same time, individual departments have the flexibility to use and manage data in ways most suited to their specific functions. \n\nThis strategy is ideal for medium to large companies requiring both company-wide consistency and department-specific agility in data handling.\n\nOverall, the choice of data strategy depends on the company's size, structure, industry, and needs.\n\nFurther reading: 6 Types of Reports for Making Data-Driven Decisions\n\nData Strategy Framework\n\nBefore building a data strategy, it’s important to understand what a data strategy consists of. Your data strategy framework should consider the following essential data strategy components:\n\nData Governance\n\nData governance involves establishing rules, policies, and standards to ensure data across the organization is secure, accurate, and compliant. It determines what kind of data is collected and how. And it clarifies data ownership and who has access to what. \n\nData Quality\n\nData quality evaluates a company’s data based on factors like:\n\nAccuracy\nCompleteness\nConsistency\nReliability\nFreshness\n\nAssessing data quality helps organizations spot any errors or issues and determine whether the data in their systems is fit to serve its intended purpose.\n\nData quality is important. According to Gartner, poor data quality costs organizations $12.9 million per year on average.\n\nTo determine the quality of their data, organizations can inventory their data assets and perform baseline studies to measure the accuracy, uniqueness and validity of selected data sets. Data management tools can help with this. \n\nData Architecture\n\nData architecture refers to the overall structure and setup of an organization's data ecosystem. This includes the design of databases and any other tools used to store or manage data. Like data warehouses (central repositories of information) and cloud platforms (online data storage solutions).\n\nData architecture aims to ensure that the data infrastructure supports the organization’s requirements in terms of performance, scalability, and reliability. \n\nFor instance, consider a fast-growing startup. As the business scales, its data needs will also evolve. Initially, a small database might be sufficient. However, as the company grows, this basic setup probably won’t be able to handle the increased volume and complexity of data.\n\nData Compliance\n\nData compliance ensures an organization's handling of data is in line with relevant data protection laws and regulations. \n\nAlmost every business collects at least some data on its customers. Even if it’s just website cookies and email addresses, like this:\n\nCompanies are legally obligated to keep customer data safe and use it fairly, which is where privacy laws come in.\n\nPrivacy laws set clear expectations for how companies should handle people's personal information. They tell businesses what they can and can't do with the data they collect—like not sharing it with third parties without permission. Failure to comply can lead to heavy fines. \n\nThe laws you need to follow will depend on where your company is based and where you do business. \n\nFor example, if you operate within the European Union or handle data from EU citizens, you likely must comply with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Similarly, if your business activities involve the state of California in the U.S., the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) likely applies. \n\nData Security \n\nData security is the practice of protecting data from unauthorized access. Like ransomware hacks and other cybersecurity threats. \n\nData security includes elements like:\n\nEncryption: Converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access\nAccess control: Setting user permissions to restrict data access to authorized individuals only\nRegular audits: Conducting checks to identify vulnerabilities and update security measures\nEmployee training: Educating staff on how to avoid common cyber threats, like phishing emails\nIncident response planning: Preparing a clear plan on what to do in the event of a data breach\nData Operations\n\nData operations cover the day-to-day management of data. This includes data processing, backup, recovery, and maintenance. \n\nEfficient data operations ensure that data is always available and reliable, supporting ongoing business activities and decision-making processes.\n\nAnalytics and Reporting\n\nAnalytics and reporting transform raw data into meaningful insights. This involves data analytics platforms to analyze data and generate reports to inform business strategies. \n\nAnalytics is important because it enables organizations to turn their data into insights. So they can identify trends, patterns, and opportunities. Such as which products are the most popular, which marketing channels are most effective, and which markets they should focus on or expand into.\n\nData Culture and Literacy\n\nTypically, a company collects data on two groups of people: employees and customers. Both groups should know what kind of data the company collects, why, and how it is stored and processed.\n\nCustomers need to be sure you are handling their data in a secure and compliant way. And that information needs to be transparent. For example, Semrush’s data security policy is visible on the company website.\n\nEducating and engaging employees is key to leveraging data effectively. A data-driven culture encourages a mindset where employees use data to guide their decisions, leading to improved business performance.\n\nHow to Build a Data Strategy in 7 Steps\n\nNow you understand which components of a data strategy are important, you’re ready to create your data strategy. The following data strategy best practices will help you do just that.\n\n1. Align with Key Stakeholders\n\nKey stakeholders, like IT and business leaders, are critical in providing the necessary insights and buy-in to support a data strategy. Their involvement helps ensure the strategy aligns with business needs and expectations. \n\nTo understand their priorities and pain points, you can ask them questions like:\n\nWhat are your main business goals and initiatives that require data and AI?\nWhat are your biggest challenges when it comes to achieving those priorities?\nWhat do you wish you could use data for that you can’t right now?\n\nPro tip\n\nInvolve stakeholders from various departments early in the process and touch base regularly while you develop and implement the data strategy. Their insights and cooperation are crucial to getting the support you need.\n\n2. Define Clear Objectives and Use Cases\n\nClear objectives and concrete use cases provide direction and purpose to the data strategy.\n\nObjectives should be closely aligned with overall business goals. Such as increasing market share, improving customer satisfaction, and driving operational efficiency. \n\nThen, you can drill down into key uses to understand how different departments and teams use data, what types of data are most valuable to them, and the outcomes they would like to achieve.\n\nPotential use cases could include:\n\nIncrease customer loyalty through personalized marketing strategies\nOptimize inventory and supply chain management\nDrive product innovation by analyzing customer feedback \nImprove financial performance through cost reduction\nImprove customer service by analyzing customer interactions\n\nPro tip\n\nRemember to factor in security and compliance. These are key considerations that might influence your use cases. Data protection laws can limit how you use customer data, especially when it comes to personalized marketing.\n\n3. Conduct a Data Audit\n\nEvaluate your existing data infrastructure, tools, and processes. This thorough audit should identify how you currently collect, store, process, and use data in your organization. \n\nHere’s how you can do that:\n\nData inventory: Begin by cataloging all data sources within your organization. Tools like Apache Atlas and Alation can assist in mapping and understanding your data landscape.\nData quality assessment: Use data quality tools such as Informatica or Talend to assess your data's accuracy, consistency, and completeness. This step is vital for identifying data quality issues that could impact analytics.\nInfrastructure evaluation: Review your data storage, processing, and management systems. Tools like AWS Well-Architected Tool and Microsoft Azure's Advisor can offer insights into the efficiency and security of your cloud infrastructure.\nProcess analysis: Examine your data collection, storage, and utilization processes.Process mining tools like Celonis and Signavio can identify inefficiencies or bottlenecks in your data workflows.\n\nPro tip\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to reveal the strengths and weaknesses in your current setup.Be realistic and thorough, and highlight areas that require improvement.\n\n4. Develop Data Governance Policies\n\nNow, it’s time to create data governance policies to define data ownership, roles, responsibilities, and procedures. \n\nStart by consulting with the key stakeholders defined in step one. This collaborative approach ensures that your policies are aligned with various business objectives.\n\nHere are some key policies you are likely to need:\n\nData ownership: Defines who owns various data assets within the organization\nData quality: Establishes standards for accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data\nData access and control: Outlines who can access data, under what conditions, and with what level of authority\nData privacy and protection: Includes guidelines for protecting sensitive data and complying with privacy laws\nData retention Determines how long data is kept and how it is archived or disposed of\nData usage: Sets rules for the appropriate use of data within the organization, including how and when it can be shared\n\nPro tip\n\nData governance is not a set-it-and-forget-it task. Compliance regulations and security needs are constantly evolving. Regularly review and update your policies to ensure they remain effective.\n\n5. Develop an Implementation Plan\n\nWith your data governance policies defined, the next step is to turn these policies into action. That’s where a comprehensive implementation plan comes in. It serves as a roadmap to help you execute your data strategy.\n\nHere’s what you’ll need to do:\n\nWrite down and share the policies: Most businesses have internal policies (for employees) and external policies (for the general public). Consider how, when, and where to publish and distribute this information. For example, you may need to add a privacy policy to your website.\nIdentify required changes: Based on the data audit, figure outwhat changes are necessary to align with the new policies. This could include upgrading technology, modifying data processes, or introducing new data management practices.\nAllocate resources: Determine the resources needed for implementation, including personnel, technology, and budget. Ensure that these resources are allocated appropriately to support the execution of the plan.\n\nPro tip\n\nSet specific timelines for each action and decide who is responsible. Deadlines and accountability help you stay on track.\n\n6. Educate Employees \n\nFor a data strategy to succeed, all employees must understand its importance and be aware of changes. Effective education and communication are essential. \n\nHere’s how to educate employees:\n\nAssess training needs: Figure out how different departments and roles use data and what they need to know\nCreate a training program: A structured training program should include data strategy essentials, like governance, policies, and the impact on employees’ daily tasks\nLeverage internal platforms: If your company is using Slack, for example, you can create a data governance channel where employees can ask questions, share insights, and access key resources\n\nThis helps employees get up to speed with the data strategy and all relevant policies. \n\nPro tip\n\nIdentify champions within each department and train them intensively on data governance topics. These champions can then share this knowledge with their teams. \n\n7. Continuously Monitor and Refine Your Data Strategy\n\nFinally, regularly monitoring and adjusting your data strategy is essential for its long-term success. You should:\n\nCompare the outcomes and your business objectives\nMake necessary adjustments to stay aligned with evolving business needs and market conditions\nAsk users for feedback via Google Forms, Slack channels, or other survey tools\n\nPro tip\n\nImplementing monitoring tools such as Varonis DatAdvantage and Apache Ranger can help you monitor data usage and achieve compliance with policies and regulations.\n\nData Strategy Tools\n\nYou'll need the right tools to ensure your data is insightful, secure, and compliant.\n\nLet's explore the key types of data strategy tools, from data management systems to analytics platforms and security solutions. \n\nData Management Tools\n\nImage Source: Microsoft\n\nData management tools are the backbone of any data strategy. They store, process, and manage large amounts of data. \n\nThis includes databases like Oracle, a comprehensive and widely used database system known for robust performance and scalability. And Microsoft SQL Server, which offers a combination of advanced analytics and security. \n\nData management also includes cloud-based solutions. Meaning businesses can store and access them over the internet. Popular solutions include AWS, Microsoft, and Panoply. \n\nData Analytics and Visualization Tools \n\nData analytics platforms help organizations slice and dice raw data and turn numbers into trends and actionable insights. Like which products people buy the most, or which times of the year are most profitable. \n\nAnalytics platforms offer a range of functions that allow businesses to perform complex statistical analyses. \n\nData analytics platforms encompass general business analytics tools. \n\nFor example:\n\nSAP Analytics Cloud is a platform that combines business planning with dashboards, reporting, and predictive analytics\nMicrosoft Power BI lets you consolidate data from different sources and create reports, dashboards, and data visualizations\nMarketing Analytics Tools\n\nMarket analytics tools play a key role in your data strategy. They can help you understand marketing performance, competitors, and, most importantly, your customers.\n\nFor example, Market Explorer enables you to analyze any market, identify industry leaders and their acquisition channels, see traffic trends, and check audience demographics.\n\nAnd a tool like Traffic Analytics will provide data on competitors' website traffic, including the number of visitors and where they came from.\n\nGoogle Analytics tracks and reports website traffic, providing insights into user behavior and website performance.\n\nAnalyze Any Company’s Online Performance\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nData Security Solutions\n\nSecurity solutions protect organizations’ data from unauthorized access, breaches, and other threats. \n\nThey include features like encryption, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and access control mechanisms, providing a shield against hackers and cybercriminals.\n\nCommon cybersecurity solutions include Acronis for data backup, disaster recovery, and secure file sharing and Cohesity for data management to defend companies against ransomware and more.\n\nSuccessful Data Strategy Examples\n\nLet’s explore how some leading companies have successfully implemented data strategies to understand their customers and meet their needs better. \n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix uses data to offer highly personalized viewing experiences and decide which shows to invest in.\n\nThe streaming platform greets users by name when they open the platform and provides personalized recommendations on the home screen. Netflix says these recommendations are based on a user's viewing habits and the behavior of similar users. \n\nNetflix doesn’t just recommend shows users are likely to enjoy. Netflix also personalizes many aspects of the platform, including:\n\nTitle cards and imagery\nMessaging\nTrailers\n\nFor example, Netflix created 10 versions of the “House of Cards” trailer to promote the show. Users who liked a specific actor in the show were more likely to see a trailer with them in it, personalizing their viewing experience.\n\nThis tailored approach enables Netflix to show audiences the most appropriate shows for them in the most appealing way.\n\nStarbucks\n\nStarbucks’ rewards program collects data to enhance customer experiences and drive loyalty. \n\nCustomers can sign up for free and start collecting member points (known as stars) using the Starbucks mobile app. This not only encourages customers to consume more Starbucks products to collect points, but it also gives the company a ton of data. \n\nStarbucks can use that data to: \n\nSend tailored offers via email and in-app push notifications\nMonitor which locations are popular (and which aren’t)\nEngage with customers on their birthdays\nReach out to customers who haven’t ordered in a while\n\nThis all helps Starbucks foster brand loyalty and boost recurring sales. \n\nAirbnb\n\nAirbnb is a leader in the hospitality industry. And it’s a great data strategy example. They use data to increase the likelihood of guests finding a place they’ll enjoy. \n\nWhen a guest searches for accommodation, Airbnb uses machine learning algorithms to match guests with relevant listings. The search results page is essentially personalized recommendations based on the places guests click on, the places they view, and host preferences. \n\nThis data-driven approach helps guests find somewhere they are likely to book. Which helps Airbnb drive more bookings and happy customers.\n\nCreate Your Own Powerful Data Strategy \n\nData is more than just numbers and statistics. It's a valuable asset that can open doors to new opportunities, innovations, and growth.\n\nIn the era of big data and AI, the businesses that succeed will be those that not only collect data but truly understand how to use it.\n\nAs you embark on your data strategy journey, remember that clear objectives and the right tools are essential. \n\nTry Market Explorer now and start collecting customer insights to power your data strategy. \n\nLearn About Your Industry\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
