  "content": "Growing your brand’s online global presence is one of the surest ways to generate more traffic, leads, and customers.\n\nMost of the world’s population is connected to the internet. And this number only increases with each passing year. To tap into this ever-expanding pool of potential customers, your website will have to accommodate the diverse needs and preferences of regional audiences.\n\nThis is where website localization comes into play. \n\nToday, we’ll cover the basics of website localization and why it should matter to your business. We’ll also walk through several website localization best practices to help you penetrate new global markets more effectively.\n\nWhat Is Website Localization?\n\nWebsite localization is the process of tailoring your website’s content to the languages, currencies, and cultural preferences of different international markets.\n\nThe goal is to ensure your content is accessible and relevant to users from a wide range of regions, helping you create a stronger brand connection with diverse audiences. \n\nWebsite localization and translation aren’t the same thing. \n\nYes, translation is a vital part of localization. But to successfully adapt your website to worldwide audiences, you also need to accommodate social norms, dialects, spelling conventions, consumer behaviors, and legal requirements that differ from region to region.\n\nWhy Website Localization Matters\n\nWhen you tailor web content and design to various global audiences, you ensure all site visitors receive an equally good user experience no matter their background or location. \n\nYou should do this as soon as possible if you want to connect more effectively with your existing international audience or establish a foothold in new markets.\n\nBecause users find it easier to trust and engage with websites that meet their cultural expectations, localization will enhance your ability to grow and retain a global audience. \n\nBut a non-localized website will have the opposite effect. For example, a site that caters to an American audience is less likely to resonate with a Thai audience—and vice versa.\n\nThe 6 Key Steps of Website Localization\n\nSo what does the website localization process look like?\n\nHere are the steps you should follow.\n\n1. Plan Your Website Localization\n\nFirst, lay the groundwork for your localization initiative.\n\nThis starts with market research.\n\nNaturally, you’ll want to prioritize markets where there’s considerable demand for the types of products or services you offer. \n\nOne way to pinpoint such markets is with Google Analytics. Check where your existing visitors come from. If you notice a large proportion of users from Germany, but your site is only available in English, consider creating a German version.\n\nSemrush’s Market Explorer tool can also help you better understand the competitive landscape in different countries. \n\nFor example, below is the market share in France for bulk.com—a popular nutrition and supplements company—versus two of its competitors: myprotein.com and theproteinworks.com. \n\nYou can see that myprotein.com is favored in that country. Theproteinworks.com is relatively unknown. And bulk.com is somewhere in the middle. \n\nAnd here’s the market breakdown for Italy, where bulk.com has a significantly larger market share:\n\nOnce you know the main players in each market, you can study their marketing activities to develop your own regional strategy.\n\nUsing our example, bulk.com might want to review myprotein.com’s activities in France. That way, they can determine what might work well for them. And how they might differentiate themselves. \n\nInstead, in Italy, bulk.com might want to build on what’s already working.\n\nMarket Explorer lets you compare your site’s market share against any domain in any country. \n\nHere’s how it works.\n\nIn the “Locations” menu, select the country or region you want to explore. For this example, let’s select the United States.\n\nUnder “Competitors,” enter at least three domains to compare. For now, let’s use the same domains as earlier.\n\nGive your list a name and hit “Create and analyze.”\n\nNext, you’ll see the “Overview” report. This provides a bird’s-eye view of your selected market.\n\nIn the “Market Summary” section, you’ll find several metrics to help you quickly assess the state of your intended market. \n\nThese include market share for each domain in your list. Plus a breakdown of market demand.\n\nFurther down the report, you’ll see the “Growth Quadrant” section. This matrix depicts the relative market performance of each competitor in your list over a given period.\n\nThe matrix is split into four quadrants: \n\nNiche Players: Sites with relatively low traffic and slow growth\nGame Changers: Sites with relatively low traffic but fast growth \nEstablished Players: Sites with relatively high traffic but slow growth\nLeaders: Sites with relatively high traffic and fast growth\n\nIn our example for October 2023, theproteinworks.com and myprotein.com saw positive traffic growth. But bulk.com saw negative traffic growth.\n\nThese and other reports within the tool can help you identify which markets might have demand for your products, what your competition might look like, and where you might have a competitive edge. \n\nFurther reading: Market Explorer Guide\n\nGain Competitive Insights\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nBefore committing to new global markets, you’ll also need to understand any local laws or regulations that will affect your site. These may include rules around data protection, content restrictions, and anti-money laundering regulations. \n\nLocalization of websites tends to be complex and requires input from several stakeholders. So we recommend assembling a dedicated team to coordinate, implement, and manage your localization initiative.\n\nThe size of your team will depend on factors like budget and the scope of your project. But it should at least include a developer, a designer, a translator (who understands the target market), and a quality assurance (QA) engineer.\n\n2. Conduct Keyword Research\n\nOnce you’ve identified suitable markets, it’s time to understand search demand in your new market through local keyword research.\n\nThe goal is to work out how users search for products and services like yours in their local language or dialect. This may differ from how they search within your home market.\n\nSuppose you run an ecommerce store that sells sweatpants in the U.S. If you planned on expanding to the U.K. market, you’d want to prioritize the term “joggers” (a more common term for sweatpants in the U.K.).\n\nUse our Keyword Magic Tool to see how keyword usage varies in different countries.\n\nFirst, enter your seed keywords into the search bar and use the drop-down to specify your target regional market. In this example, our keyword is “sweatpants” and our target market is the U.K.\n\nThen hit “Search.”\n\nNext, you’ll see a table listing the largest number of related keywords.\n\nYou can see that “sweatpants” received on average 6,600 monthly searches in the U.K. over the past 12 months.\n\nNow repeat the process for the seed term “joggers.” Here, you can see the term received 27,100 average monthly searches—significantly more than the term “sweatpants.”\n\nUse these insights to tailor your localization approach for the new market. Not only will your website resonate better as a result, it may also rank better in search.\n\nGet Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Translate Website Content\n\nNext, it’s time to adapt content to the language and dialect of your new target audience.\n\nDeveloping an effective multilingual website goes beyond literal translation. It requires content “transcreation”—translating text while adapting your message to the cultural context of your intended audience. \n\nThis is why it’s so valuable to hire translators who are native speakers of the language with a deep understanding of the local market.\n\nRemember: Your website content isn’t a single entity. Each type of content serves a different purpose and requires a distinct approach to localization.\n\nHere are some of the types of content you can expect to find on your site and the appropriate approach for localizing each of them:\n\nBrand content: Content that discusses your brand, including your homepage, “about us” page, and “why us” page. The goal here is to internationalize content. Use neutral language and avoid regional references or figures of speech.\nMarketing content: Content that sells or educates your customers, including product pages, landing pages, and blog posts. The goal here is to localize content. Speak the language of your target audience and lean into their specific cultural context.\nTechnical content: Content that provides detailed and specialized information about your products or services, including FAQs, user guides, and product descriptions. The goal here is to translate content with high accuracy to avoid incorrect use of your products or services.\nLegal content: Any content dealing with legal matters or regulations, including your terms of use, refund policy, and Impressum. This content should comply with the laws of the local state or country.\nContact information: Content that tells users how to reach you, including phone numbers, email addresses, and operating hours. You should tailor this content to each separate market.\n\nSo what does effective website localization look like?\n\nCoca-Cola’s site is a prime example of exceptional localization. Here’s the brand’s homepage in Spain:\n\nIn South Korea:\n\nAnd in Canada:\n\nNotice how the language, message, and visuals are uniquely tailored to each locale.\n\n4. Localize Website Design\n\nLocalization isn’t just about the words on the page.\n\nIt also involves using images, colors, and iconography that resonate with local audiences.\n\nPage layout is also an important consideration. In Western languages, people read from left to right in an F-shaped pattern. But in Arabic, people read from right to left.\n\nHere’s Coca-Cola’s homepage in Algeria. See how the navigation bar is shifted to the top-right of the page to accommodate Arabic script.\n\n5. Make Technical Changes to Improve Localization\n\nOptimizing your site for regional audiences also involves some technical fine-tuning.\n\nHere are some things to address to ensure your site offers a seamless user experience for regional audiences:\n\nSpecial characters: Encode your website in UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8). This allows webpages to display text and characters from different languages.\nCurrency: Use market-specific currencies\nDate format: Use the appropriate date format for each market. For example, in the U.S., dates are displayed as MM-DD-YYYY. In the U.K., it’s DD-MM-YYYY.\nPage formatting: Ensure there’s enough space on localized pages to accommodate longer translated tex\nSite search: Configure your site search to handle queries in multiple languages\nPage speed: Consider simplifying your design for countries with slower internet connections\nPayment methods: Allow local users to use culturally preferred payment options\n6. Test Your Localized Website\n\nYou should rigorously test your localized site before launch to resolve any technical, linguistic, or usability issues.\n\nConsider running a web test on a sample of target users. Ask for feedback on user flow, imagery, color scheme, messaging, loading time, cultural relevance, and any other factors that will help you further optimize your site for local audiences.\n\nKeep a close eye on your analytics after launch to track the progress of your localized site. You can use Semrush’s Position Tracking tool to monitor your daily rankings compared with regional competitors.\n\nCheck out our in-depth guide for help setting up a Position Tracking campaign. \n\nTrack Your Rankings with Ease\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nGo International with Website Localization\n\nWebsite localization improves your odds of successful global expansion.\n\nAdapting your content and web design to the tastes and needs of local audiences builds trust in your brand, drives engagement, and leads to more sales.\n\nBy following the steps outlined above, and using tools like Market Explorer for competitive benchmarking, you’ll be well on your way to gaining a solid foothold in other markets.\n\nGain Competitive Insights\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
