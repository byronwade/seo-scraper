It sparks brand awareness, nurtures leads, and closes deals. \n\nBut to harness the potential of email, you need a reliable email marketing platform. That's what this guide is going to help you with.\n\nWe've done the groundwork and narrowed down the 10 email marketing platforms most likely to fit your business needs.\n\nHere's a quick summary of the platforms we reviewed and their standout features.\n\nTop 10 Best Email Marketing Platform Picks\n\n\n\n\nBest for\n\n\t\n\nPlatforms\n\n\n\n\nBest for large businesses \n\n\t\nDrip\nMailchimp\n\n\n\nBest email marketing automation\n\n\t\nActiveCampaign\nConstant Contact\n\n\n\nBest for creators and monetizing digital products\n\n\t\nConvertKit\n\n\n\nBest for omnichannel marketing\n\n\t\nOmnisend\nAWeber\n\n\n\nBest for businesses on a tight budget but looking for advanced features\n\n\t\nMoosend\nBrevo (formerly Sendinblue)\nMailerlite\n\nNote\n\nWe have used email marketing platform, email marketing software, and email service provider interchangeably throughout this post.\n\nWhat Is an Email Marketing Platform?\n\nEmail marketing platforms are software designed to create, send, and optimize email campaigns. \n\nThese platforms typically offer a range of features, including email template designs, automation workflows, contact list segmentation, A/B testing, and analytics. \n\nDepending on your email platform, you may have access to advanced and niche features alongside basics and must-haves.\n\nBenefits of Email Marketing Platforms\n\nEmail marketing platforms help you enhance efficiency, scale email marketing campaigns, and deliver personalized experiences to your target audience.\n\nTo send the best marketing emails, a platform that meets the following requirements will be your ideal choice.\n\nEfficiency\n\nCreating an email marketing campaign is often time-consuming.\n\nIt takes a lot of time and brainstorming to design and send relevant emails to all your subscribers at the right time.\n\nAn email service provider (ESP) handles these tasks by helping you design, write, and automate emails.\n\nAutomated emails (emails triggered by certain user actions) save time and resources by eliminating the need for manual email creation. You can schedule messages to be sent at specific times, such as after a new subscriber signs up. This is especially useful if you have a large subscriber base.\n\nScalability\n\nAn email service provider helps you build and grow your email list and easily handle large volumes of email without compromising the quality.\n\nFor example, Melissa Run, founder of The Design Space, grew her email list by 50 times in two years using the email marketing platform Active Campaign.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nThese platforms help you collect data about your email subscribers—from basic details (name, location, job, company name, etc.) to advanced information (email interaction history, purchases made, number of clicks, etc.).\n\nUsing these data points, you can divide your subscribers into segments (groups of individuals sharing similar traits or behaviors). And send them personalized emails. Through personalization, you deliver a relevant message that resonates with the recipient.\n\nHaute Hijab, a small startup company, generated $200K+ in total revenue using Drip’s abandoned cart automated series.\n\nTop 10 Email Marketing Platforms Reviewed\n\nEvery platform offers unique features to cater to different business sizes and marketing campaign requirements.\n\nSo what is the best email marketing platform?\n\nThese are our 10 contenders.\n\n1. Mailchimp\n\nMailchimp is a widely used and preferred email marketing software. Mailchimp is an option for companies with large budgets that want to scale their email marketing campaigns.\n\nMailchimp Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\n\t\n\nCons\n\n\n\nForever free plan\n130+ pre-built email templates categorized by industries and themes\nInbox preview to see how your email will render in different email clients\nAvailable in English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and German\nAdvanced analytics features with AI-powered recommendations\n\t\nCustomer support isn’t reliable and takes too long to respond\nExpensive if you have a large email list size\nMailchimp’s Main Features\nInbox Preview\n\nInbox preview is part of Mailchimp’s email template builder. It helps you see how your email will appear across different email clients. Like Gmail, Yahoo, and Apple Mail.\n\nThe way email elements appear in Gmail might not be the same in Yahoo or Apple Mail. So, this feature helps you avoid rendering or accessibility errors that can hurt the performance of your emails.\n\nAdvanced Email Analytics \n\nMailchimp's reporting provides access to metrics in an easy-to-understand dashboard.\n\nOn the Marketing Dashboard, you see metrics like open rates, click-through rates (CTR), and the amount of revenue generated. You can customize the reporting dashboard by selecting which metrics you want to see.\n\nYou can also visualize metrics as graphs. Which paints a clear picture of performance over time. One option for visual view is the conversion rate (number of users who took an action you wanted them to take out of total emails delivered). \n\nClear graphic representations make it easier to analyze and draw helpful insights.\n\nMailchimp Pricing\n\nMailchimp has a forever free plan with 1,000 monthly email send lists for up to 500 subscribers. Paid plans start with:\n\nEssentials: $13/month for three users, 500 subscribers, and 5,000 email sends\nStandard: $20/month for five users, 500 subscribers, and 6,000 email sends\nPremium: $350/month for unlimited users, 500 subscribers, and 150,000 email sends\n\nPlan prices increase incrementally as the number of subscribers increases. And the Premium plan can accommodate more than 250,000 subscribers. \n\n2. ActiveCampaign\n\nActiveCampaign is known for its powerful email marketing automation features.

Each sequence, known as a \"recipe,\" is easy to edit. Industry-based categorization makes it easy to find the most relevant sequence for your needs.\n\nOnce you connect your online store, the software will start collecting your customers' data. Like purchasing behavior, interaction, and traffic. You can create customer segments and send targeted emails based on them.\n\nEmail Automation Builder\n\nActiveCampaign's email automation journey builder is straightforward and user-friendly.\n\nYou start with an entry trigger, an action the user takes to begin the workflow. For example, when the user submits a form on your website.\n\nThen, you can add those users under specific tags, such as “New users.” Tags help organize user data. And also come in handy during segmentation. You can add time delays between emails. Or specify conditions by using Yes/no logic to trigger different sets of emails. \n\nHere’s how a basic email sequence looks in ActiveCampaign. It’s easy to understand, and highlights all the triggers and delays.\n\nActiveCampaign Pricing\n\nActiveCampaign offers a 14-day free trial. Email send limits are based on the number of contacts in your account. For example, if you have 700 subscribers in your account on the Lite plan, your limit is 7,000 emails per month. Paid plans include:\n\nLite: $39/monthfor one user, 1,000 subscribers, and 10 x number of subscribers = number of email sends\nPlus: $70/month for three users, 1,000 subscribers, and 10 x number of subscribers = number of email sends\nProfessional: $187/month for five users, 2,500 subscribers, and 12 x number of subscribers = number of email sends\nEnterprise: $323/month for 10 users, 2,500 subscribers, and 15 x number of subscribers = number of email sends\n3.

The screenshot shows an example of an automated email drip targeted toward users who have added an item to a cart, but have not completed the checkout process. \n\nDynamic Content Blocks\n\nMoosend's dynamic blocks can populate emails automatically with interchangeable details specific to the user experience, like the name of a product, the URL where it can be found, an image, or tags. This saves you time from manually adding details while still crafting personalizing messages to your audience. \n\nTo use this feature, you have to integrate Moosend with an ecommerce platform, like Shopify, WooCommerce, or Wix. Then you can choose from four block types: cart abandonment, product recommendation, product browsing, and RSS campaigns.\n\nLet’s say someone visits your ecommerce store, looks at a page of women’s boots, clicks on a few options, but ultimately exits the page without a purpose. With automation and dynamic blocks in place, Moosend can automatically kick off an email to the visitor. Luring them back with images of the boots they were interested in, or similar items.\n\nMoosend Pricing\n\nMoosend has a 30-day free trial with no send limit.

So, when deciding on a platform, ask yourself these questions:\n\nDoes the software have the option to add dynamic content based on the recipient’s demographics (such as gender and location)?\nHow simple/fast is it to pull data from your other platforms (e.g., advertising platforms or payment software)?\nDoes the software support cross-channel personalization (e.g., using website data to personalize emails)?\nIs there an option to localize email content (e.g., add a nearby store’s location)?\nIntegration with CRM and Landing Page Builders\n\nBy integrating customer relationship management (CRM) and a landing page builder with an ESP, you can collect data from multiple sources and use it to create more effective email campaigns.\n\nFor instance, you can pull CRM data and use it to send personalized emails. And through landing pages, you can generate leads and instantly add them to a nurturing sequence.\n\nAdvanced Analytics and Reporting Tools\n\nTo measure and optimize your campaign performance, you need access to in-depth data. An ESP with advanced analytics will help you gather data beyond common email metrics such as open rate, CTR, or unsubscribe rate.\n\nYou’ll be able to collect granular data such as device-specific engagement, email client breakdown, and engagement over time.\n\nAdditionally, look for how the ESP presents data to make it easy to understand:\n\nDoes it offer data visualizations and display performance over time?\nDoes it offer click-through maps or heatmaps?\n\nWhen you have access to a diverse set of data that's easy to analyze, you can easily optimize your campaign.\n\nEnhancing Engagement with Email Campaigns\n\nNo matter which platform you choose, the goal is to engage the recipient. You want to build trust and encourage them to take a certain action.\n\nWhile each platform equips you with the tools to carry out your email campaigns, the success lies in how you create and send emails.\n\nHere are some of the most effective ways to make your emails shine.\n\nWrite Compelling Email Subject Lines\n\nThe email subject line is what sets the stage for the reader. It also makes 47% of recipients decide whether they want to open your emails.\n\nA compelling subject line captures the reader's attention, persuading them to click on the email. It also helps you stand out in a crowded inbox.\n\nUse these tips to write a persuasive subject line:\n\nTip\n\n\t\n\nWhy It Works\n\n\t\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nAsk a question\n\n\t\n\nMake them curious to know the answer\n\n\t\n\nFeeling stuck at work?

It's about making readers feel seen, valued, and understood.\n\nWhen you offer a tailored experience, recipients are more likely to engage and buy from you. Due to personalization, 80% of customers are more inclined to buy.\n\nTo personalize your emails, you must have access to various user data points such as\n\nGeography (e.g., country, city, or state)\nDemographics (e.g., age, gender, income, or education)\nPsychographics (e.g., lifestyle, interests, or hobbies)\nBehavior (e.g., buyer journey stage brand loyalty traits or purchasing style)\nMedia (e.g., preferred social media or TV channels)\nBenefit (e.g., what the customer values most, like customer service or quality)\n\nMost of this data is easy to find in your email analytics dashboard. But you can easily collect basic details via signup forms or surveys.\n\nUsing the above-mentioned data points you can personalize emails in various ways that go beyond the recipient’s first name:\n\nSend product recommendation emails based on the recipient’s browser history\nSend abandoned cart emails based on the recipient’s purchasing history\nSend a weekly or monthly digest emails to your customers\nSend special discounts on birthday or anniversaries\nSend a “thank you” email to your loyal subscribers\n\nFor instance, Grammarly sends a daily digest based on the user's weekly activity. Such emails build trust and propel recipients to engage with the emails.\n\nFurther Reading: Market Segmentation: Types, Examples, and Strategies\n\nCreate Clear CTA Buttons\n\nThe call to action (CTA) in an email shows the action you want readers to take after reading your email. It can be to sign up for your product launch, use a discount code, or submit a feedback survey.\n\nTo get higher engagement, your CTAs should be clear, actionable, and appealing.\n\nUse the following tips to write and design click-worthy CTAs:\n\nUse action verbs such as “Download your report” or “Shop the launch” \nHighlight the benefit, such as “Subscribe and get 10% off”\nUse responsive designso that CTA button appears correctly on various devices\nKeep your CTA design separate from emails by using different font type, size, or button color\nUse customized designs for multiple CTAs\n\nHere's a good CTA example from Apple. \n\nThe email contains two CTAs. The primary CTA (main action you want users to take) “Pre-order” is more prominent and noticeable because of a contrasting background color. Secondary CTA (relevant action) “Learn more” catches less attention as it’s a plain text CTA.\n\nFurther reading: How to Win People Over with Compelling Email Content\n\nOptimizing Send Times for Maximum Reach\n\nWhen scheduling your emails, consider two factors: the day of the week and the time of the day.\n\nBoth are important because you want your audience to open your emails, engage with them, and click through. But, the right timing is a product of various factors: your industry, each recipient’s geography, email type, and holidays and events.\n\nResearch can give you a starting point on when to send emails to generate higher opens and clicks:\n\nTuesday, 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. ET, then 12:01 p.m. to 3 p.m. ET, according to Hubspot\nTuesday, 8 p.m., 2 p.m., or 5 p.m., according to Omnisend\nTuesday or Thursday, 10:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., according to Brevo\nChoosing the Right Platform for Your Needs\n\nAll email marketing platforms help you solve different pain points. But, to make an informed decision keep your business requirements and goals at the core.\n\nThink about what features would help you achieve your goals while considering the pricing structure and your budget.\n\nAnd, if you need help brainstorming ideas for your next email campaigns, writing click-worthy subject lines, and boosting your email campaign’s performance, Semrush's AI Writing Assistant and other tools can help. \n\nSee for yourself with a free trial of Semrush today!\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign up Now →",
