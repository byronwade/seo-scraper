  "content": "What Are YouTube Search Trends?\n\nYouTube search trends indicate which topics people are currently searching for the most on YouTube.\n\nThey highlight how popular certain search terms are. Meaning terms people frequently enter into YouTube’s search bar.\n\nTrending searches on YouTube help you understand what viewers are interested in right now. And what kinds of videos they want to watch.\n\nWhy Are YouTube Trending Searches Important?\n\nYouTube search trends help you understand the types of videos people are interested in watching. Which you can use to inform the videos you include on your YouTube channel.\n\nHere are some of the specific ways you can benefit from considering YouTube search trends:\n\nPlan Better Content\n\nYouTube trending searches can guide you in creating content that viewers are actively seeking. \n\nThis insight will help you align your upcoming content topics with viewers’ interests. And possibly increase engagement and shares.\n\nLet’s say you run a YouTube channel that recommends software to startups. \n\nIf you notice that videos on “remote work software” are trending, you can plan more videos on that topic for your channel.\n\nThis will allow you to tap into what your audience is already interested in, making your content more likely to be viewed.\n\nAttract New Audiences\n\nBy posting videos on trending topics, you can attract new viewers who are searching for those terms.\n\nThis can broaden your channel’s reach, introduce your content to a newer audience, and bring you more views.\n\nTake Salesforce, for example. \n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been a trending topic across all social media platforms. So, Salesforce has published several YouTube videos on this topic:\n\nStand Out by Providing a Unique Spin\n\nYou can use trending searches to discuss popular topics in unique ways. To differentiate your content and help it stand out.\n\nFor example, here are YouTube search results for the query “cold shower.”\n\nAll the videos above claim that the cold shower is good. Except the first one, which stands out for providing a unique take on the subject.\n\nA contrasting view on a trending topic can draw more attention and views.\n\nAnd even if the views are relatively fewer, offering a different opinion can make your brand more memorable. And help you connect more deeply with certain audiences.\n\n6 Ways to Find YouTube Search Trends\n\nHere are six ways you can find trending searches on YouTube:\n\n1. Keyword Analytics for YouTube\n\nKeyword Analytics for YouTube allows you to monitor the most searched keywords on YouTube. And which videos have the most views.\n\nIt shows top keyword trends by country. And you’ll also get data on search volume, Competitive Rate (a metric that indicates how difficult it is to rank for a keyword), and more for each keyword.\n\nOpen the tool and click “Get started” under the “Fast growing keywords” section.\n\nYou’ll find a list of keywords with the greatest change in searches for a current period compared to a previous period.\n\nYou can toggle between “Last Day,” “Last Week,” and “Last Month” to change the time range. \n\nYou can also search for a word or phrase relevant to your niche (e.g., “iphone”). To look at related YouTube keywords.\n\nThen, click on any keyword to find more data on the right side. Including Competitive Rate and the monthly search volume.\n\nIf the search volume for any YouTube keyword relevant to your niche has increased over the last day, week, or month, it might be a good topic to focus on.\n\nTip: Try to pick relevant keywords that have a growing search trend and a low Competitive Rate. A low Competitive Rate means it’s easier to rank for that keyword, while a growing search trend indicates interest in that topic is increasing.\n\nFind Trending YouTube Keywords\n\nwith Keyword Analytics for YouTube\n\nTry for Free →\n2. YouTube’s Trending Page\n\nThe YouTube Trending page is a dedicated page on YouTube that showcases the most popular videos (including Shorts) across the platform.\n\nYouTube determines what’s trending based on factors like view count, how quickly views are growing, and the video’s age. \n\nThe Trending page is split into several categories: Now, Music, Gaming, and Movies. This categorization can help you quickly find trends relevant to your channel’s niche.\n\nFind relevant videos from this trending list and analyze them.\n\nGo through their thumbnails, titles, and descriptions. And check out what the videos cover.\n\nYou can even look at the comments under each video to get a sense of what the audience wants, thinks, and cares about.\n\nThis analysis can provide you with insights into how you can optimize your videos better. And offer you inspiration for what you can talk about in your content.\n\nThe YouTube Trending page is updated regularly (every 15 minutes). Ensuring you have the latest information on what viewers are watching.\n\nNote: While the Trending page shows what’s popular, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should create similar content. Use it as a guide to understand viewers’ interests. And tailor your content accordingly.\n\n3. Google Trends\n\nGoogle Trends is a free tool that shows the popularity of search queries over time. Including for YouTube.\n\nGo to its Explore page and enter a seed keyword (a broad search term related to your niche). Then, click “Web Search” and choose “YouTube Search.” (Feel free to change the location, duration, and categories as needed.)\n\nNow you’ll see data exclusive to YouTube.\n\nThe first graph will show the interest over time for your search term on YouTube.\n\nAt the bottom of the page, you’ll also find a “Related queries” section with two options: Rising and Top.\n\nThe “Rising” tab will show you queries related to your search term that have gained the most significant growth in search volume\nThe “Top” tab will show you the terms most frequently searched along with the term you entered\n\nBased on this data, you can create videos on topics that are trending or becoming more popular.\n\nGoogle Trends also gives you the option to compare search terms.\n\nLet’s say you make tech-related videos. And you want to know whether people are more interested in Apple or Samsung. \n\nYou can use the comparison option to find out. \n\nMore people have searched for Samsung than Apple on YouTube in the specified time range. So, it might be a good idea to create videos focused on Samsung products.\n\n4. Track Your Competitors\n\nThe topics your competitors are creating YouTube videos around can indicate what audiences want.\n\nNote that these topics may or may not reveal the latest trends. Because your competitors won’t always post content on trending topics. \n\nBut once you know what these topics are, you can check the search volume on related keywords. And determine whether you should create videos on them as well.\n\nYou can manually check your competitors’ YouTube channels to see some high-level metrics. Or use Social Tracker to see up to 20 competitors’ metrics in a detailed report.\n\nOpen the tool and follow the configuration steps to connect your YouTube channel and add your competitors. \n\nOnce you’ve finished setting up Social Tracker, head to the YouTube tab. \n\nThen, select the name of a competitor from the drop-down menu.\n\nYou can now see information about the type of videos your competitors have posted in the past 30 days. And learn about their posting frequency. And which videos have the highest number of views, likes, and comments.\n\nIf several of your competitors have started posting videos on the same topic (and their videos are performing well in terms of views, likes, and comments), that suggests there’s strong interest in that topic. \n\nTrack Your Competitors’ Social Media\n\nwith the Social Tracker\n\nSign up Now →\n5. Other Social Media Platforms \n\nPlatforms like Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok are often the birthplace of trends that eventually make their way to YouTube. Because their immediate and interactive nature allows trends to emerge and spread quickly.\n\nFor example, “cash stuffing” was a popular personal finance trend that emerged on TikTok.\n\nMany YouTube creators have posted videos on this topic as well.\n\nSocial platforms are generally buzzing with discussions about the latest events and product releases.\n\nAnd many of them have their own trending sections. Such as Instagram’s “Explore” page, X’s “Trending” topics, and TikTok’s “For You” feed. \n\nBy monitoring these sections, you can spot trends as they’re gaining traction.\n\nFor example, let’s say you see iOS is trending on X because of a new version being released:\n\nThere’s a good chance people are searching for something similar on YouTube. And that creating YouTube videos on the new feature is a good idea.\n\nSo, keep an eye on other social media platforms. To see what’s trending there. \n\nAnd follow top influencers in your niche on these platforms. So you can see what they’re talking about.\n\n6. Niche Publications and News Websites\n\nTopics covered by industry-specific news websites can often signal what’s gaining public interest. And this can help you predict what your audience may soon start searching on YouTube.\n\nFor instance, if you run a tech channel and a new gadget is making headlines on tech news websites (like TechCrunch), it’s a good sign that a video about it could attract viewers on YouTube.\n\nSimilarly, if a unique recipe is trending on a culinary website (like Delish), a cooking channel could make a video recreating that recipe.\n\nMany news websites also have “Most Popular,” “Most Read,” or “Most Shared” sections. These can give you an idea of what topics are currently resonating with the public. Here’s an example from The Verge:\n\nSo, find relevant publications and news websites in your niche. And follow them regularly to keep an eye on emerging trends and popular topics.\n\nAssess those topics to determine whether they align with your channel. And have the potential to be searched on YouTube.\n\nHow to Use YouTube Trends to Grow Your Channel\n\nNow that you know how to check YouTube search trends, you can create and optimize videos based on them. To attract a larger audience to your YouTube channel, grow your subscriber base, and increase engagement.\n\nHere are the broad steps to help you do just that:\n\n1. Identify and Analyze Relevant Trends\n\nStart by identifying trends that are relevant to your channel’s niche. \n\nYou can use tools like Keyword Analytics for YouTube to find popular topics.\n\nOnce you’ve done YouTube keyword research and have a list of trending or popular searches, you’ll want to understand them better. \n\nFollow these steps to analyze a YouTube search trend:\n\nResearch who’s interested in the trend by examining which channels are discussing it and what their viewers’ demographics are. This will help you in tailoring your content to the right audience.\nUnderstand the conversation by reviewing comments on trending YouTube videos, social media posts, and news articles. You can use these insights to assess public opinion and address popular questions in your video.\nAnalyze how competing YouTubers in your niche are leveraging the trend. This can inspire your own content and help you understand what has already been covered.\nThink about the trend’s longevity. Is it a fleeting fad or something that will continue to be relevant? This will help you decide if the trend is worth investing your time and resources into.\n2. Create Relevant Content\n\nAfter identifying and analyzing a trend, the next step is to create content that aligns with it. Here’s how to do it:\n\nOne approach is to create a video that directly addresses the trend. \n\nFor example, if you run a cooking channel and a certain type of diet (like the Keto diet) is trending, you could create a video with a recipe that fits this diet.\n\nAlternatively, you can weave the trend into your existing content plan. \n\nLet’s say you run a fitness channel and a new workout is trending. Instead of creating a separate video for the challenge, you could incorporate it into your regular workout routines video.\n\n3. Optimize Your Videos\n\nFollow YouTube SEO best practices to optimize your video for the trend and maximize your visibility. \n\nStart with an eye-catching thumbnail and a title that includes trending keywords.\n\nYour video description should be concise but informative. And incorporate relevant keywords without going overboard.\n\nHere’s an example of a good YouTube video title and description from tech YouTuber Nick Ackerman that includes some important keywords:\n\nThese steps will help you optimize your video and increase its chances of appearing in trending searches on YouTube.\n\n4. Engage with Your Audience\n\nFinally, make sure to engage with your audience. \n\nRespond to comments, ask for feedback, and encourage viewers to share your videos. \n\nThis may not directly increase your video’s visibility. But it does help in building a loyal follower base who feel seen and heard.\n\nAlso, encouraging shares can extend your video’s reach. And the comments section can offer valuable insights into additional angles on the topic you might consider covering in future videos.\n\nHere’s Ryan Serhant, a renowned real estate broker with a popular YouTube channel, responding to people’s comments under his YouTube video:\n\nStay up to Date with the Latest Trends\n\nYou can improve your YouTube performance by creating videos on relevant YouTube search trends. \n\nBut you have to do it the right way. And leverage the right tools.\n\nGet started by finding trending searches related to your niche using Keyword Analytics for YouTube.\n\nFind Trending YouTube Keywords\n\nwith Keyword Analytics for YouTube\n\nTry for Free →",
