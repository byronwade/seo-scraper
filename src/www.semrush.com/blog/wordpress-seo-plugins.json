And offers advice to improve these aspects.\n\nFor example, if the plugin spots that your article’s title doesn’t include your target keyword—the search query you want to rank for in Google—it’ll highlight that as an issue. And recommend adding it to your title.\n\nOr, if the plugin detects duplicate or plagiarized content, it will highlight the problematic text.\n\nHaving duplicate or plagiarized content on your website can lead to ranking problems (not to mention potential legal consequences if it’s plagiarized). The SEO Writing Assistant plugin is a valuable asset for your SEO strategy because it highlights issues like this.\n\nKey Features\n\nThe Semrush SEO Writing Assistant plugin comes with the following features:\n\nRecommendations on relevant keywords to use in your content for better Google rankings\nRephraser feature to paraphrase content with AI\nReadability analysis to tell you how easy or difficult your content is to read\nTone of voice analyzer to improve the writing style and tone of your content\n\nAnd much more.\n\nPricing\n\nThe SEO Writing Assistant is a freemium WordPress plugin.

Yoast SEO\n\nYoast SEO is one of the most powerful SEO plugins for WordPress.\n\nAt its most basic level, Yoast allows you to set the title tag (the title that shows in search results), URL slug (the end portion of the URL), and meta description (the brief summary of the page that may show in search results) on your pages. Which are all important from an SEO standpoint.\n\nPlus, Yoast can help you manage technical tasks like:\n\nSetting up canonical URLs (the main versions of pages that have duplicates) on your pages\nSetting up meta robots tags (code that tells search engines how to crawl, index, and display the page)\nProviding titles for your pages’ breadcrumb navigation\nPreventing search engines from indexing your pages\nPreventing search engines from following links on your pages\n\nWhen it comes to content-level optimization, Yoast identifies SEO-related issues in your content. And highlights opportunities for improvements.\n\nNote that these are just recommendations. And you don’t always have to follow every Yoast recommendation. \n\nFor example, Yoast suggests evenly distributing your focus keyword throughout the content. \n\nBut this is an outdated SEO tactic that won’t help you rank. In fact, it can even have the opposite effect in some cases.\n\nBesides scanning your content for SEO-related issues, Yoast also analyzes your content’s readability. And provides suggestions for improvements. Such as:\n\nUsing active voice\nLeveraging short sentences and paragraphs\nMaking simple word choices\nKey Features\n\nHere are a few stand-out features of Yoast:\n\nStructured data (also called schema) capabilities that make it easy to add different types of structured data to your website. This is code that helps search engines better understand your content, which can increase your chances of getting rich snippets.\nRedirect management that enables you to easily set up 301 redirects for deleted pages so your users don’t encounter 404 errors\nInternal linking suggestions based on words and phrases you could use to link to other content on your site\nSemrush integration to get keyword suggestions directly in WordPress. This allows users to easily optimize content for the right keywords.\nPricing\n\nYoast’s SEO plugin offers both a free and paid version. \n\nWith the free version, you’ll have limited features and functionality. The premium version costs $99 per year and gives you access to all of Yoast’s features.\n\n4. SEOPress\n\nThe SEOPress plugin allows you to improve your pages’ SEO from an intuitive user interface. Which makes it a popular choice for beginners and experts alike.\n\nSEOPress allows you to set up title tags and meta descriptions on your pages. \n\nIt will also show you if the title or meta description is too long. To help you make adjustments that prevent them from being cut off in search results.\n\nPlus, SEOPress lets you define Open Graph tags. These tags control how your preview links appear on social media platforms such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, etc.\n\nPeople are more likely to share content with optimized Open Graph tags. Because they make content more eye-catching in social media feeds.\n\nHere’s how a preview link without Open Graph tags appears for our blog post about title tags.\n\nIt uses the first image from the blog post as the preview image. And the title and descriptions aren’t optimized.\n\nA preview link with Open Graph tags, on the other hand, appears how you want it to:\n\nSEOPress also has a feature that shows how well-optimized your page is for your target keyword(s).\n\nIt looks at a variety of factors, including keyword density (how often your keyword appears in the text) and word count.\n\nBut those aren’t ranking factors and don’t tell you much about whether the page is optimized. So, focus on other elements like canonical URL and structured data.\n\nKey Features\n\nSEOPress has many solid features:\n\nCustom XML sitemap creation to help search engine bots find and index your pages\nRedirect manager that lets you set up 301, 302, and 307 redirects\nStructured data support to implement different types of schema on your website\nOpenAI integration to automaticallygenerate title tags and meta descriptions with AI\nPricing\n\nSEOPress is a freemium WordPress plugin. The free version provides limited functionality.\n\nThe paid version (which starts at $49 per year) provides additional features and more advanced functionality, such as the OpenAI integration, a redirect manager, etc.\n\n5. Rank Math\n\nRank Math is a feature-rich SEO plugin with a user-friendly interface.\n\nRank Math helps with basic on-page SEO (improvements to your webpages designed to boost rankings) . Like setting up title tags and meta descriptions.\n\nAnd you can preview these elements to see how they might appear in search results.\n\nThe plugin can also create a robots.txt file and sitemap. Both of which are important to control search engines’ crawling behavior on your website.\n\nRank Math comes with tons of features and tools that give you better control of your WordPress site’s SEO. \n\nKey Features\n\nHere are some of RankMath’s main features:\n\nEasy-to-follow setup wizard guides users through the essential SEO settings and configures them automatically\nGoogle Analytics and Search Console integrations that save time by displaying important information about your website within the WordPress interface\n404 monitoring identifies errors, so you can resolve them and create a better user experience\nStructured data implementation to help you win rich snippets\nPricing\n\nRank Math is a freemium SEO plugin.
