  "title": "8 Google Maps Marketing Tactics to Drive Local Business",
  "content": "Google Maps marketing is a set of tactics you can use to make your local business listing appear more prominently in Google’s map results.\n\nMaps marketing helps you reach people who search for relevant products and services in your area. And convert more of them into customers.\n\nYour Google business listing, also known as your Business Profile, can show up in three key locations:\n\nThe Google Maps website and app (when someone searches for a business, product, or service). The number of listings depends on the query.\nThe “local pack,” also known as the “Google map pack.” Google displays this in standard search results when it thinks the user wants nearby or localized results. It typically contains three listings.\nThe Local Finder, which opens when you expand the local pack. The number of listings depends on the query.\n\nGoogle chooses business listings based on three main criteria:\n\nRelevance: How well the business matches what the searcher wants\nDistance: How far the business is from the search location\nProminence: How popular the business is in the real world and online\n\nHere are eight Google maps marketing tactics your local business should try:\n\n1. Create or Update Your Business Profile\n\nGoogle Business Profile (GBP, formerly Google My Business) is a free tool that lets you manage your business listing on Google.\n\nComplete and detailed profiles rank better in Google’s map results. Because Google can “better understand your business and match your profile to relevant searches.”\n\nThey also drive local business by helping customers make informed decisions.\n\nYour Business Profile is what’s previewed in Google Maps, the local pack, and the Local Finder. Users can click on the snippet to view more information:\n\nInformation from your Business Profile should also appear on the search engine results page (SERP) for your business name:\n\nIf you haven’t already, add your business to Google Maps. Follow the prompts to add information about your business and verify your location.\n\nOtherwise, head on over to GBP. To ensure all your information is present and correct. \n\nBusiness name\n\n\t\n\nThis should be how it appears in the real world (e.g., on signage)\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n\n\t\n\nChoose a primary category and up to nine extra categories\n\n\n\n\nAddress and pin location\n\n\t\n\nTell customers where they can find you (leave blank if you go to your customers)\n\n\n\n\nService area\n\n\t\n\nTell customers where you will travel to (leave blank if customers come to you)\n\n\n\n\nHours\n\n\t\n\nTell customers when you’re open\n\n\n\n\nPhone\n\n\t\n\nAdd your primary phone number and up to two more contact numbers\n\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\t\n\nAdd a link to your business website \n\n\n\n\nAttributes/Hotel attributes\n\n\t\n\nTell customers about attributes your business has, such as “Wi-Fi”\n\n\n\n\nPhotos and videos\n\n\t\n\nAdd photos and videos to help prospects learn about your business, premises, products, and/or services\n\n\n\n\nFrom the business\n\n\t\n\nEnter a business description up to 750 characters long, making sure to mention key products and services\n\n\n\n\nOpening date\n\n\t\n\nTell customers when your business first opened\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\t\n\nAdd information about your services \n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\t\n\nAdd information about your products\n\n\n\n\nMenu (food businesses only)\n\n\t\n\nProvide information about your menu items\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in and checkout times (hotels only)\n\n\t\n\nTell customers when they can check in and check out\n\n\n\n\nHealth insurance information (U.S. health care providers only)\n\n\t\n\nList the health insurance networks for your business\n\nFor example, Corky’s Ribs & BBQ has provided (almost) all the information a hungry patron might need:\n\nImportant note: Don’t neglect your Business Profile once you’ve optimized it. Keep it updated with the latest information.\n\nFor example:\n\nTemporary opening hours\nPricing changes\nNew products or services\n\nThis ensures your Google map listing always has complete and accurate information.\n\n2. Engage Locals Through Posts\n\nUse GBP’s posts feature to make announcements that encourage more people to visit your location or get in touch. You can share updates, events, and offers.\n\nLike this:\n\nTo start, head over to GBP and select the business you want to create a post for.\n\nThen, click “Add update.”\n\nAnd choose the type of post you want to create.\n\nFill out the form that appears with your post details. Then click on “Preview.”\n\nTip: Add photos and videos to make your posts more eye-catching and informative. And run your text through a spell-checker to ensure it’s clear and professional.\n\nIf you’re happy with the way that looks, click “Post.”\n\nAlternatively, schedule your Business Profile posts using Semrush’s free Social Poster tool. This makes it easy to launch your Google Maps marketing campaigns at the perfect time.\n\nGo to “All profiles” > “Add profile” > “Connect Google Business Profile” and follow the instructions to get started.\n\nThen click “New post” to draft, schedule, or publish an announcement.\n\nA new window will allow you to draft, preview, and schedule your Google post.\n\nTip: Connect your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and/or Pinterest accounts to create and view all your posts in one place.\n\nSchedule Google Posts\n\nwith the Social Poster Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Clean Up Local Listings\n\nLocal listings (or citations) are references to your local business’s name, address, and phone number (NAP). Typically featured in online directories like Yelp. \n\nGoogle looks at local listings across the web to check if its own business listings are accurate. If it’s not confident in your profile, it may be less likely to display it to users.\n\nSo, it’s crucial that your local listings are consistent. Especially when it comes to your NAP information—key information for local customers.\n\nCheck your local listings for free with Semrush’s Listing Management tool. Enter your business name as it appears on your GBP and select the right result from the suggestions.\n\nScroll down to see whether you’re listed in top directories. And whether your details are correct.\n\nThese results show that Corky’s Ribs & BBQ is missing out on valuable exposure: \n\nAnd has NAP issues in some of its listings:\n\nIf your business has similar issues, reach out to each directory to get your information added or corrected.\n\nOr use the Listing Management tool to fix them all at once.\n\nClick the “Try it now” button and follow the instructions to purchase your subscription.\n\nThen connect your GBP to get more specific insights into your local listing’s performance.\n\nThe tool will also automatically submit your business’s details to the top directories in your country. Which should improve your Google map rankings. And help more prospects get the right information.\n\nSide note: Listing Management gives you access to many more features that will benefit your Google Maps marketing. Keep reading to learn more, or check out our Listing Management guide.\n\nClean Up Local Listings\n\nwith the Listing Management Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Improve Your Reviews\n\nGoogle says that “Google review count and review score factor into local search ranking. More reviews and positive ratings can improve your business’ local ranking.”\n\nNotice how all the top-ranking businesses for “barbecue joints in Memphis” have thousands of reviews and a high average rating:\n\nHigh-quality reviews also help you stand apart from competitors.\n\nEncourage customers to leave a review on your Business Profile using one or more of the following methods:\n\nReview request emails: If you have the customer’s email address and permission, send a review request email. Leave enough time for them to experience your product or service first.\nCustomer conversations: Ask customers to leave a review after any successful conversation. Whether it’s in person, over the phone, or online.\nPrint materials: Print review requests on your receipts, business cards, and other marketing materials. Or display a sign in your store.\n\nGoogle offers a free customized marketing kit to help you. \n\nIt contains printables such as the “Review us on Google” window sticker, business card, and postcard. In addition to assets you can use online.\n\nTo get a direct link to your review page, select your business on Google and click “Ask for reviews.” \n\nA pop-up will appear with a link that you can send to customers.\n\nAnother way to improve your Business Profile reviews is to respond to them. \n\nThis shows that you care about customers’ feedback. \n\nAnd helps you neutralize any negative reviews.\n\nMake sure you’re signed up for review notifications. Click on the three dots beside “Profile Strength” to open the “Settings” section of GBP.\n\nAnd toggle on “Customer reviews.”\n\nThen respond to any feedback as soon as possible. Making sure to be clear, polite, and helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use Semrush’s Review Management tool. It brings reviews from multiple platforms (including Google) into one place. \n\nFilters and sorting options make it easy to prioritize. \n\nFor example, look at reviews where you’ve “Not replied,” starting with the “Oldest” first.\n\nIf you have a Premium Location, you can reply right away. There’s no need to log in to each platform.\n\nImportant note: Google may also display “Reviews from the web” on your Business Profile. Which are average ratings from third-party platforms such as Facebook and OpenTable. These don’t impact your map rankings directly, but they can impact consumer decisions.\n\nIf most prospects use another platform to research your business (e.g., Trustpilot, Tripadvisor, or G2), it may be worth asking customers to leave a review for you there rather than on Google. It’s unlikely they’ll be willing to review you on both. Alternatively, leave it up to customers to choose a platform.\n\nMonitor and Respond to Google Reviews\n\nwith the Review Management Tool\n\nTry It Now →\n5. Submit Questions and Answers\n\nYour Business Profile has a “Questions & answers” section. Here, Google users can ask or answer questions about your business. And so can you.\n\nThis is your opportunity to provide extra information and help potential customers with specific needs.\n\nIf you receive any questions, provide clear, polite, and helpful answers as soon as possible. \n\nMake sure you’re logged in to your GBP account so your answers are marked as “Owner.” That way, readers know the information is reliable. And that you care about customer service.\n\nWant to answer any FAQs that haven’t been submitted yet? Add them using the “Ask a question” button. Then respond to them right away.\n\nThat way, future prospects can get the information they need without having to ask or wait for a response.\n\nHere are some question ideas to inspire you:\n\nAre you dog-friendly?\nWhat payment methods do you accept?\nIs parking available?\n\nTip: Speak to your customer service team and check other support channels (e.g., social media) to see what questions get asked most.\n\n6. Make Your Website SEO-Friendly\n\nHaving a more SEO-friendly website can lead to better rankings in map results. If Google believes your website is relevant to searchers, it believes your Business Profile is, too. \n\nFor example, look at the SERP for “memphis bbq.” Memphis Barbecue Company’s website ranks top.\n\nThis business also ranks high in the local pack (and, therefore, the Local Finder).\n\nMemphis Barbecue Company ranks high for this search query in Google Maps, too.\n\nYou can use all kinds of local SEO techniques to improve your website’s rankings. And therefore boost your map marketing. Such as:\n\nBuilding links on local websites\nPublishing localized content\nFixing technical issues on your site\n\nGet started with the basics in our free local SEO course.\n\n7. Track Your Performance\n\nTrack your performance to see whether your Google Maps marketing strategy is working. That means monitoring your Business Profile’s visibility in Google Maps, the local pack, and the Local Finder.\n\nYou want your listing to appear every time someone searches for a relevant local keyword (i.e., when someone looks for relevant products or services in your area). And rank as high as possible.\n\nIf you’re not seeing results within a few weeks, you may need to adjust your Google Maps marketing strategy.\n\nFirst, choose your target keywords. The search queries you want to rank for and track. \n\nLet’s say you owned a barbecue restaurant in Memphis, Tennessee. You’d want to rank for local keywords like:\n\nBarbecue near me\nBest barbecue in Memphis\nBarbecue joints in Memphis\n\nOur local keyword research guide teaches you how to find what prospects search for. And get associated data. So you can optimize for keywords that will drive the best results.\n\nOnce you have identified target keywords, track your performance for them in Semrush’s Position Tracking and Listing Management tools.\n\nTip: Want to get straight into tracking? Use some basic keywords like “[Business Type] near me” and “[Service] [City Name]” for now. You can add extra keywords later.\n\nPosition Tracking Tool\n\nWith Semrush’s Position Tracking tool, you can see which target keywords trigger the local pack. And if so, whether your Business Profile appears.\n\nEnter your domain and click “Set up tracking.”\n\nThen enter the “Location” to track rankings in. Many local businesses want to compete at the city level. But it might be more realistic to focus on your ZIP code area. \n\nMake sure the “Volume to show” field is set to “Local.” That way, you’ll see the average number of monthly searches for each keyword in your chosen location.\n\nNext, enter your business name as it appears in the local pack. And click “Continue To Keywords.”\n\nNow you should type your target keywords in. Or import them from elsewhere.\n\nClick “Add keywords to campaign” then “Start Tracking.” \n\nYour project is now ready.\n\nTo track your Google Maps pack rankings, go to the “Overview” tab.\n\nScroll down to “Rankings Overview” and look at the “SF” (SERP features) column. Click on the number to see if the keyword triggers the local pack.\n\nIf your Business Profile ranks in the local pack, the map pin icon will appear in the “Pos. [Date]” column.\n\nTip: Not ranking for a particular product or service? Check that it’s mentioned on your GBP and website. \n\nTrack Your Local Pack Rankings\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nListing Management Tool\n\nSemrush’s Listing Management tool allows you to track your rankings in the Local Finder. With a Premium Location, you can track Google Maps rankings, too.\n\nIf you haven’t already, set up your location. Making sure to add your brand name, categories (up to nine), and phone number.\n\nAlso add your full business address in the “Basic information” section.\n\nThen click “Start distributing info” once you’re done.\n\nLocal Rankings\n\nYou will monitor your Local Finder rankings in the “Local Rankings” tab. \n\nThe tool will automatically use the first category you selected as a keyword.\n\nTo add more keywords, go to the “Locations” tab. And select the location you’d like to track.\n\nThen go to your “Local Rankings” tab. And click “Select keywords.” Enter up to five search queries you’d like to track. \n\nThese should be the most important local keywords for your business.\n\nTo view your rankings, select the keyword you want to track from the list above your ZIP code chart.\n\nThe “Your Local Finder Position” column shows where your Google map listing ranks when the searcher is in your business’s ZIP code.\n\nYou can track your positions in two more ZIP code areas. Simply click on the “+ Add ZIP” button below the chart.\n\nRevisit the tab anytime to view your Local Finder rankings. And how they’ve changed over time.\n\nHeatmap\n\nIn the “Heatmap” section of Listing Management, you can track your rankings in Google Maps.\n\nTo get started, enter up to 10 local keywords you want to track. And set your “Scan radius” and “Grid size” to determine where rankings are checked.\n\nClick “Collect data” to generate your heatmaps. The numbers show your ranking in each search location.\n\nSwitch between keywords to see your positions for each.\n\nTip: Check out your top competitors in the listings. Try to work out why they’re ranking higher. This can help you improve your Google Maps marketing strategy.\n\nTrack your Google Maps Visibility\n\nwith the Listing Management Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n8. Try Google Maps Advertising\n\nGoogle Ads is a paid service that can help you secure Business Profile rankings for priority keywords in priority search locations.\n\nAdvertising through “local search ads'' can help you earn additional exposure on Google Maps results. The idea is that the cost is outweighed by the extra customers you acquire.\n\nHowever, it’s not possible to advertise on Google Maps exclusively. Google may serve your local search ads across other Google properties, where it thinks they are relevant.\n\nFor example, here’s an ad on mobile search:\n\nWhen they do appear, Google map ads take the form of sponsored listings. \n\nThey rank at the top of the local pack, Local Finder, or Google Maps results. And have an “Ad” label. Like this:\n\nOr a “Sponsored” label. Like this:\n\nGoogle Maps advertising works on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis. You pay every time someone does the following:\n\nClicks to get location details\nClicks to get directions\nClicks to call (on mobile)\nClicks through to your website\n\nThe CPC amount depends on various factors. Including how much you (and any competitors) “bid” during setup. You can set an average daily budget to prevent overspending.\n\nTo get started, create a Google Ads account using the same email address you use for GBP.\n\nAnd link your GBP to Google Ads. Then you’re ready to create campaigns. To be eligible for Google Maps ads, you must do the following:\n\nTarget local keywords\nTarget a specific location\nSet bids by location\n\nLearn more on Google’s Help Center.\n\nTip: Google also offers Local Services Ads, which appear at the top of the SERP when someone enters a relevant local keyword. These can work alongside your Google map ads.\n\nGet More Local Business With Google Maps Marketing\n\nIt’s time to put your learning into practice and get more local business from Google map listings. \n\nSemrush has all the local SEO tools you need to strengthen your Google Maps marketing and advertising strategies.
