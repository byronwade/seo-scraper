  "content": "Digital public relations (PR) is similar to traditional PR but uses online channels to reach a broader audience.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore exactly what digital PR is, why it’s important, and how you can use it to build a stronger brand. We’ll go over its search engine optimization (SEO) benefits, too.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\nWhat Is Digital PR?\n\nDigital PR is a marketing practice intended to raise brand awareness and increase credibility. \n\nIt involves communication techniques designed to improve an organization's public image by leveraging online channels. \n\nTypical activities include:\n\nMedia outreach \nPress release creation and distribution\nEvent planning and promotion\nSponsorship opportunities\nCrisis communication\nPublicity stunts (attention-grabbing tactics)\nInfluencer partnerships like the one shown below\n\nDoing these things encourages people to talk (hopefully, in a positive way) about your brand. \n\nHow Is Digital PR Different from Traditional PR?\n\nThe difference between traditional PR and digital PR is that the latter focuses solely on online channels. \n\nImagine you run a tech startup. Your productivity app just reached one million downloads and you want to mark the milestone publicly. \n\nAs part of a traditional PR strategy, you could encourage radio programs, news stations, and journalists to share the news about your app. You could even invite prominent voices to an event or a press conference. \n\nDigital PR could involve getting bloggers, YouTubers, podcasters, and online industry publications to talk about your app and the recent accomplishment. You could even host a celebratory virtual event or release your own marketing podcast episode.\n\nHow Is Digital PR Different from Link Building?\n\nDigital PR leverages many tools to improve brand awareness and reputation. And can result in backlinks (links from authoritative websites to yours), but it’s also aimed at gaining online media coverage, social media chatter, mentions in podcasts, etc. \n\nUltimately, digital PR is about shifting perception.\n\nLink building is a tactic within the SEO field that focuses on improving site authority and search rankings by acquiring backlinks from other websites. So, success is measured in the number of links received. \n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Digital PR?\n\nDigital PR offers many benefits:\n\nEnhanced visibility: Channels are fairly accessible and very broad. Digital PR helps you reach a big (even global) audience quickly.\nStronger reputation: Positive media coverage and influencer endorsements can quickly improve your brand's reputation. This social proof is often seen as trustworthy.\nMore traffic: A digital PR strategy encourages reputable sources to talk about your brand. And more people may visit your website as a result.\nImproved SEO: Because digital PR efforts can lead to high-quality backlinks, it could boost your SEO efforts. Because those backlinks signal to search engines that your website is trustworthy and deserving of high search rankings.\n\nPro tip\n\nTo master digital PR and reap the full benefits, check out this step-by-step Digital PR course from Brian Dean. \n\nExamples of Digital PR \n\nLet's explore five popular digital PR tactics to help inspire your own efforts.\n\n1. Data-Driven Research Studies\n\nProducing data-driven research is a great way to get journalists to cover an interesting topic while mentioning your brand. That’s why research studies are among the most common digital PR tactics.\n\nTo create a data-driven story that might inspire media coverage, you can either use your own data (if you're lucky enough to have it available). Or use third-party data (think social media analytics, information from the U.S. Census Bureau, etc).\n\nA powerful example is IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report. \n\nThe tech company surveyed 550 companies that experienced cybersecurity attacks. To collect insights around the cost and impact of such attacks. \n\nThe results were picked up on by major tech news outlets like TechRepublic:\n\nThe report generated backlinks from 9,200 domains (according to Semrush’s Domain Overview tool). \n\nThis likely helped position IBM as a thought leader in the security space. Which is great for a company that sells cybersecurity products.\n\nGet Insights About Competitors’ Sites\n\nwith the Domain Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Creative Campaigns\n\nCreative campaigns are another effective way to come up with a story that journalists will want to cover. Think eye-catching imagery or something memorable that will get people talking. \n\nAll you need is a great idea that stands out from the crowd.\n\nThe Future Gamer campaign by OnlineCasino.ca is a stand-out example. \n\nThe company creatively shed light on an important topic—gaming addiction. By sharing 3D visualizations of Michael (the future gamer of 2040) to show how gamers could look in 20 years if they don’t adopt healthy habits.\n\nThis raised awareness and showed the brand cares about people’s well-being.\n\n3. Newsjacking\n\nNewsjacking involves monitoring the news and reacting to breaking stories with expert insights, comments, and advice. To enhance your online visibility and reputation.\n\nFor example, cereal brand Surreal capitalized on the recent buzz around AI tools to gain attention on social media. \n\nThey posted billboards showing prompts they entered into an AI copywriting tool to help promote the cereal. Then, they shared the results in a viral LinkedIn post:\n\nThe post got more than 1,400 likes and 75 comments. And the billboards were most likely seen by thousands of people. \n\nThe playful approach drew attention to Surreal’s product features in a humorous way.\n\n4. Expert Insights and Thought Leadership\n\nSharing your knowledge and insights with journalists can be an effective way to earn media attention.\n\nServices like Connectively are full of journalists looking for an expert view. Just find a topic you’re confident in and supply some information for a chance to be featured in their piece.\n\nYou can also proactively email journalists and media outlets to offer help. Or even pitch them a story.\n\nFor example, a marketing agency founder shares his advice on how to be a successful entrepreneur in “5 Expert Tips To Transform Business Growth” on Forbes. \n\nThe article showcases the agency founder’s expertise, and links to his agency’s site.\n\nIn many cases, you can predict what journalists will be talking about at certain times of the year. So you can plan what to focus on and when to send out pitches.\n\nAnd if you build rapport with journalists, you may be able to consistently earn coverage.\n\n5. Product- or Service-Focused PR\n\nSharing news related to your products or services by publishing and distributing press releases can also help you earn links and media attention. \n\nThink about what would make a journalist write about your product. And why someone would want to read about it. \n\nHave you launched a new product line? Opened a new store? Expanded internationally? Introduced new features?\n\nApple is a good example. When they launched their Journal app (which they announced via press release), many online media outlets reported on the new app, how it works, and how it provides mental health benefits. \n\nLike this article from Gizmodo:\n\nHow to Run a Digital PR Campaign\n\nReady to get started with digital PR for your brand? Let’s walk through the process, step-by-step. \n\n1. Set Clear Objectives\n\nIt’s essential to define clear, measurable goals for your digital PR campaign. This will help you choose the right tactics. \n\nNeed some inspiration?\n\nHere's a list of common digital PR objectives and their associated tactics and metrics:\n\nThis strategic approach will help you maximize the impact of your campaign. And achieve meaningful results.\n\n2. Understand Your Audience\n\nYou need a deep understanding of your audience to run an effective digital PR campaign. \n\nAnd go beyond surface-level demographics. Uncover the motivations, preferences, and pain points that drive their online behavior.\n\nUse One2Target from Semrush to gain insight into your audience. \n\nTo get started, enter at least one competitor’s domain into the text field. Choose a location in the drop-down, and click “Analyze.”\n\nIn the resulting report, you’ll find the audience’s demographics. Including age and gender:\n\nClick “Socioeconomics” tab to get more detailed insights, including employment status, income, and education level:\n\nNext, go to the “Behavior” tab to find out where your audience hangs out online and the devices they use. \n\nThis is helpful for prioritizing channels for your digital PR content. \n\nFor instance, if you notice your target audience has a strong preference for YouTube, it probably makes sense to focus efforts on this channel. \n\nOnce you understand your audience’s key characteristics, you can craft detailed buyer personas for each of your ideal customer types. \n\nDetailed personas help your team envision the people they’re campaigning to. To ensure your PR campaign resonates with your target audience.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse the free buyer persona tool from Semrush to build your buyer personas. The tool includes ready-made templates and guiding questions to help you cover all key areas. \n\n3. Analyze the Competition\n\nIt’s helpful to figure out what your rivals are doing right and where they may be falling short. To gain a competitive edge.\n\nFor example, you can use the Backlink Gap tool to find out which sites are linking to your competitors. \n\nType in your domain and the domains of up to four competitors. And click “Find prospects.”\n\nYou’ll then see a list of sites linking to your competitors.\n\nFor example, here we can see that Microsoft, BuzzFeed, and People have linked to other car brands but not to Audi. \n\nIn each row, you’ll see the number of backlinks each brand has from the corresponding domain. \n\nClick on the arrow to the left of the number to see more details, such as the headline and the specific page it links to:\n\nYou can use this information to figure out who’s linking to your competitors and what they’re saying.\n\nThis is useful because if there are reputable sites linking to one or more of your competitors, there’s a good chance they’ll be open to linking to you as well. Which means they could be great places to pitch stories to.\n\nFind Backlink Opportunities\n\nwith the Backlink Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Create Newsworthy Content\n\nThe next step is to create content that’s compelling to your intended audience, aligned with your brand voice, and relevant to your PR goals. \n\nThink about the types of content you’ll create and the topics you’ll cover.\n\nTo guide you, consider these questions:\n\nWhat impression do we want to make?\nWhat message do we want to send?\nWho is the message for?\n\nThere are many types of content you could create. But you might want to consider data-based storytelling. According to a report from Cision, journalists strongly prefer it.\n\nBut what topic should you focus your research on? \n\nTo find trending topics in your industry, use the Topic Research tool. \n\nLet’s say you have a skincare brand. Open the tool, type “skincare routines,” and click “Get content ideas.” \n\nYou’ll get a complete report on related topics. Make sure to click the toggle next to “Trending subtopics first” to prioritize topics that have been particularly popular over the last 60 days:\n\nClick “Show more” to get a list of related questions and top headlines:\n\nThis might inspire you to conduct a study on the ingredients found in different types of face masks. And even reach out to dermatologists to provide more insights. \n\nThen, you can create a data-rich report to distribute via multiple channels.\n\nLet’s go over that next.\n\n5. Develop a Distribution Strategy\n\nOnce you’ve published your content, you’ll need to think about how you’re going to share it with the world. \n\nThere are three types of channels to consider:\n\nOwned channels like your own website, blog, and social media platforms\nEarned channels like news sites and reviews \nPaid channels like ads or influencers on social media\n\nGetting the content on your own website and social media platforms should be pretty straightforward. Same for paid media—if you have the budget for it.\n\nBut getting news sites to write about you? That’s where PR pitches come in. \n\nA PR pitch involves contacting journalists and asking them to report on your news. \n\nFor a successful PR pitch, it’s often a good idea to first write a press release. Which you can send out to journalists to attract their attention and encourage them to cover your story.\n\nHere’s what a standard press release template looks like:\n\nA good press release gets to the point fast. And makes it clear why your story is newsworthy and why people should care. \n\nIt should also include your company background, contact information, and links to the content you’ve created.\n\nYou can send your press release directly to journalists or publications. Or use a service like Prowly. \n\nWith Prowly, you can use filters to find the right media contacts to pitch.\n\nAnother option is to work with a PR agency. \n\nAn agency will distribute (and oftentimes even write) the press release for you. And they usually have existing relationships with media partners, which can improve your chances of getting coverage. \n\n6. Monitor and Measure Results \n\nTracking progress will help you evaluate your campaign's effectiveness. So you can make adjustments where needed.\n\nFocus on backlinks and online mentions across various websites, blogs, and social media platforms.\n\nTo be notified whenever a site mentions your brand, you can set up a Google Alert.\n\nJust open the tool and type in your brand name or product. And click “Create Alert.”\n\nClick the pencil icon to configure your settings.\n\nYou can specify how frequently you get alerts, what region the mentions come from, etc.\n\nWhen you’re done, click “Update alert.”\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of how your PR campaign is impacting brand awareness and perception, use the Media Monitoring app. \n\nTo get started, open the tool and select “New project.” \n\nType in the name of your brand, select a language, and click “Create Project.”\n\nYou’ll see key insights, including:\n\nThe number of mentions over time\nA summary of mentions and the names of the media outlets\nWhether brand mentions were positive or negative \n\nClick the “Mentions” tab to get a detailed breakdown of where your brand was mentioned \n\nYou can also filter for sentiment (positive and negative) and importance:\n\nFinally, click the “Analysis” tab to see a list of the most influential sites linking to you. And your estimated reach. \n\nYou can also check your Presence Score—a metric out of 100 that indicates how popular your brand is.\n\nGet Started with Digital PR\n\nDone right, digital PR can lead to greater brand awareness, improved brand perception, and even more sales.\n\nHaving the right tools makes it far easier to see whether you’re working toward those results.\n\nMedia Monitoring lets you track brand mentions across the web, find backlink opportunities, and see what the competition is up to.
