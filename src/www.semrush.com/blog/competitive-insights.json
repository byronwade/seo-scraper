  "content": "Competitive insights (or competitor insights) are pieces of information about rival businesses that empower you to make better decisions for your own business. \n\nTo get competitive insights, you need to manually analyze the activities, plans, and results of other businesses in your niche. Or use specialized tools. \n\nLet’s explore nine key competitive insights and how to get them:\n\n1. Market Share for Various Metrics\n\nCalculate the market share for every company in your industry. That way, you can put every business’s performance into perspective and identify your biggest threats.\n\nBut don’t just concentrate on share of revenue. See which companies dominate based on relevant industry metrics, such as:\n\nUnit sales\nMonthly active users\nWeb traffic\n\nThat way, you can work out which helps companies succeed in different areas.\n\nLet’s say you want to evaluate your and your competitors’ share of web traffic.\n\nWith Semrush’s Market Explorer tool, you can quickly find out how web traffic in your niche is split between domains.\n\nJust click “Find Competitors” and enter your homepage URL.\n\nThen, choose your location and click “Research a market.”\n\nThe tool will analyze traffic to your domain and up to 99 competitors’ domains.\n\nIn the “Growth Quadrant” module, you can see where you and your rivals stand in the competitive landscape.\n\nScroll down to “Share of Visits” under “Domain vs Market Dynamics” to see each company’s share of market traffic.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Traffic\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n2. Traffic Acquisition Channels\n\nKnowing where competitors get their website traffic from can help you identify acquisition channels you’re missing out on. And areas where you’re underperforming.\n\nGo to the “Benchmarking” report in Market Explorer to see which channels drive the most traffic in your market.\n\nYou can select up to five domains to compare. Analyze your biggest rivals.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the main traffic acquisition channels. And tactics to improve your performance in each one:\n\nTraffic Channel\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nTraffic Acquisition Tactics\n\n\n\n\nDirect\n\n\t\n\nVisits that occur when people type your URL into their browser or open a bookmark \n\n\t\n\nContent creation + offline marketing and advertising (e.g., direct mail and billboards)\n\n\n\n\nReferral\n\n\t\n\nVisits from links on external websites\n\n\t\n\nLink building + digital PR (getting online publications to link to/talk about your site)\n\n\n\n\nOrganic Search\n\n\t\n\nUnpaid visits from search engine results\n\n\t\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO)\n\n\n\n\nPaid Search\n\n\t\n\nVisits from search engine advertisements\n\n\t\n\nPay-per-click (PPC) marketing\n\n\n\n\nOrganic Social\n\n\t\n\nUnpaid visits from social media links\n\n\t\n\nSocial media marketing\n\n\n\n\nPaid Social\n\n\t\n\nVisits from social media advertisements\n\n\t\n\nSocial media advertising\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\t\n\nVisits from email links\n\n\t\n\nEmail marketing\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Ads\n\n\t\n\nVisits from display advertisements\n\n\t\n\nDisplay advertising\n\nFurther reading: How to Do a Digital Marketing Competitor Analysis\n\n3. Social Media Presence\n\nIf your competitors are on social media platforms that you aren’t, you could be missing out on valuable reach and engagement.\n\nMost businesses link to their social media profiles in their website footer. So, you can manually check what platforms they’re using.\n\nBut you can get a better (and quicker) understanding with the Market Explorer tool.\n\nThe “Social Media Distribution Strategy” graph in the “Benchmarking” report shows the most used platforms in your market. And a detailed breakdown for five selected domains.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of the platforms covered:\n\nReddit\n\n\t\n\nA collection of online communities/forums. Marketing on Reddit can be tricky, but it’s a good way to reach niche audiences.\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\t\n\nAn image- and video-sharing platform. It’s particularly good for brands in fashion, interior design, etc.\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\t\n\nA video-sharing platform with a popular search function. You can use YouTube SEO techniques to increase your content’s reach.\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\t\n\nA virtual pinboard that lets you post images, videos, and links. You can use the Pinterest Trends tool to find popular topics.\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\t\n\nA social network that’s particularly good for local businesses. Read about Facebook Business Manager for help getting started.\n\n\n\n\nX (formerly Twitter)\n\n\t\n\nA microblogging platform that’s commonly used for marketing and customer service\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\t\n\nThis category covers other social platforms like TikTok and Snapchat\n\nFor more competitive insights, use the Social Tracker tool (part of Semrush Social).\n\nYou can see which rivals’ posts get the most engagement on Facebook, X, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest.\n\nAnd compare select audience, activity, and engagement metrics.\n\nThen, use the inspiration and insights you gain from evaluating your competitors’ performance to guide your own social content strategy.\n\n4. Product and Service Offerings\n\nAnalyzing competitors’ products and services can help you identify potential areas for innovation. And determine ways to differentiate your offering.\n\nYou can focus on elements like quality, pricing, and features.\n\nLet’s say you own a yoga clothing brand. \n\nYou might find that none of your competitors use the same high-quality materials that you do. So, you decide to focus on this unique selling proposition (USP) in your marketing materials.\n\nAnd perhaps you learn that one of your competitors offers a wide variety of color options. So, you're inspired to expand your own color offerings.\n\n5. Target Audiences\n\nFind out which target audiences your competitors are pursuing. So you can ensure you’re not missing out on any important segments.\n\nYou can also look for gaps in the entire market. And try to fill them.\n\nCompetitors’ websites can provide insight into who’s being targeted—and how.\n\nFor example, Slack has dedicated landing pages for various departments and industries. Each one focuses on different product benefits.\n\nThe company also creates content for different target audiences.\n\nThe number of resources available for each segment indicates how important the segment is to the brand. While the content itself provides insight into Slack’s personalization strategy.\n\nWe can also learn about Slack’s customers through its success stories.\n\nIf you want to pursue the same kinds of clients, you can use these stories to gather useful information for your buyer personas (e.g., details about their pain points).\n\nTo see which audiences actually visit rivals’ websites, use Semrush’s One2Target tool.\n\nJust enter up to five competitors’ domains to see breakdowns for:\n\nDemographics: Age, gender, and country \nSocioeconomics: Household size, household income level, employment status, and education level\nBehavior: Most visited social media platforms, top interests, and device type usage\n\nIn the “Audience Overlap” section, you can see the most visited domains for each brand’s audience.\n\nThese could be great places to earn coverage (through link building or digital PR). Or to advertise your business.\n\nAnalyze Rivals’ Audiences\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\n6. Popular Webpages\n\nAnalyzing your competitors’ most visited webpages helps you work out which products, services, and content types are popular in your niche.\n\nTo get started, enter a rival domain into the Traffic Analytics tool.\n\nThen, head to the “Top Pages” report. And choose the time range and location you’re interested in.\n\nYou’ll find the following metrics for each page: \n\nTraffic Share\n\n\t\n\nPage views as a percentage of overall domain traffic\n\n\n\n\n1Y Trend\n\n\t\n\nHow page views have fluctuated over the past 12 months\n\n\n\n\nUnique Pageviews\n\n\t\n\nThe number of visits to the page (scroll to the right for a breakdown by acquisition channel)\n\n\n\n\nUnique Visitors\n\n\t\n\nThe number of individual users who visited the page\n\n\n\n\nEntrances\n\n\t\n\nThe number of website visits that started on that page\n\n\n\n\nAvg. Visit Duration\n\n\t\n\nHow long the average visit lasted (MM:SS)\n\n\n\n\nExits\n\n\t\n\nThe number of website visits that ended on that page\n\nTip\n\nClick the header of any numerical column to sort results from high to low or low to high.\n\nTo review the content on any page, click the icon to open the URL in the “Page” column:\n\nThen, apply any competitor insights you gather to your own business strategy.\n\nFor example, you might consider:\n\nStocking products that generate lots of page views\nCreating your own versions of blog posts that generate lots of entrances\nMimicking seasonal landing pages that attract lots of visits in December\n\nTip\n\nTo keep track of the new content your competitors publish, use the EyeOn tool. You can monitor website pages, social posts, and more across up to 20 domains.\n\nFurther reading: How to Do a Competitive Content Analysis\n\n7. Google Keyword Rankings\n\nLooking at competitors’ Google keyword rankings (i.e., when and where they appear in search results) is one of the best ways to spot SEO opportunities. Because you can see what’s working for your rivals and try to outperform them.\n\nTo get started, enter your domain and a competitor’s domain into the Keyword Gap tool.\n\nThen, choose your country and click “Compare.”\n\nScroll down to the keyword table and select “Weak.” \n\nThis will show you search queries that the competitor outranks you for. You can see your exact positions in the corresponding columns.\n\nTo improve these positions, you’ll probably need to optimize the ranking pages.\n\nNext, go to the “Missing” tab. To see keywords the competitor ranks for but you don’t.\n\nTo earn rankings for these keywords, you’ll probably need to create quality content from scratch.\n\nBut you should only target keywords that are relevant to your business and target audience.\n\nIf you need help prioritizing, focus on the following columns:\n\nVolume: The average number of searches the keyword receives per month. The higher the volume, the higher the potential traffic.\nKD%: The keyword difficulty score, which measures the keyword’s competitiveness. The lower the score, the easier it should be to earn a high ranking.\nIntent: The general purpose behind the search. Typically, keywords with transactional search intent are more likely to generate conversions.\n\nFurther reading: How to Do an SEO Competitor Analysis\n\nCompare Your Rankings with Competitors’\n\nwith the Keyword Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n8. Advertising Strategies and Results\n\nKnowing where competitors advertise (and what results they’re getting) doesn’t just alert you to advertising opportunities. It helps you understand your competitor’s positioning strategy—i.e., how they’re portraying their brand to consumers.\n\nWe recommend that you use:\n\nAdvertising Research to analyze competitors’ text ads on Google Search\nPLA Research to analyze competitors’ Google Shopping ads\nAdClarity to analyze competitors’ display, video, and social media ads\n\nFor example, let’s take a look at Slack’s advertising activity in AdClarity.\n\nWe can see that the company spent an estimated $27K on video and banner advertising in the U.S. during December 2023 (they weren’t running social ads at this time). And generated around 5.7M impressions.\n\nThe “Top Ads” section shows what messaging and visuals Slack used to attract interest.\n\nWhile the “Top publishers and apps” section shows where the ads were placed.\n\n9. Reputational Strengths and Weaknesses\n\nIt’s important to understand what consumers think about your competitors. Because you can try to emulate their strengths. And capitalize on their weaknesses.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf your main competitor is praised for having great customer service, you might want to adopt some of their policies yourself\nIf your main competitor is criticized for poor-quality service, highlighting your own five-star reviews could help you get more customers\n\nThird-party review platforms are some of the best places to gather competitor insights.\n\nIdentify sites that your target audiences use (e.g., Google and Yelp). Then, read through recent reviews about your competitors and try to identify common themes.\n\nWe also recommend looking at references to your competitors online.\n\nSearch those brand names in Google and explore the results to see what people are saying. (You’ll need to skip past the brand’s own website, social profiles, etc.)\n\nThe “News” section can be a particularly good place to find recent commentary.\n\nTip\n\nIf you want to narrow your Google results, you can use various search operators and filters.\n\nSee what people are saying on social media sites, too.\n\nLike this:\n\nAlternatively, streamline the entire process with the Brand Monitoring app.\n\nJust add a competitor’s name to see where they’re mentioned in the press or social media. And whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nIn the “Analytics” tab, you can track the overall sentiment balance. And look at trends over time.\n\nStart Gathering Competitive Insights\n\nWhichever methods you use to gather competitor insights, do it on an ongoing basis. Because the sooner you identify changes in the competitive landscape, the sooner you can act on them. \n\nWith Semrush, it’s faster and easier to get the digital marketing insights you need. \n\nFind out for yourself by starting your free trial.\n\nGather Competitive Insights\n\nwith Semrush’s Toolkit\n\nStart Free Trial →",
