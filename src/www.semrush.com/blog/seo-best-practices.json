  "content": "What Are SEO Best Practices?\n\nSEO best practices are tried-and-tested tactics for improving a website or brand’s visibility in search engine results pages. Without paying for ads.\n\nFollowing these best practices can help you improve brand awareness. And get more organic traffic (unpaid clicks) from search engines like Google.\n\n10 SEO Best Practices to Follow\n\nHere are the 10 most important SEO best practices you need to know:\n\n1. Align Your Content with Search Intent\n\nSearch intent (also called “user intent”) is the purpose behind every search query.\n\nIf you’d like to rank on page one of Google, you need to understand search intent and create content that matches it.\n\nFor instance, take a look at the search results for “how to make oatmeal cookies.”\n\nThe top search results are blog posts or videos. Not ecommerce pages selling oatmeal cookies. \n\nGoogle understands that people who are searching for this keyword are looking to learn. Not to buy. \n\nOn the other hand, the results for a query like “buy oatmeal cookies” are product ads and ecommerce pages. \n\nLike this:\n\nIn this case, Google understands that people are looking to buy. Hence, no links to oatmeal cookie recipes. \n\nThere are four common types of search intent: \n\nInformational: When someone is trying to learn more about something\nNavigational: When someone is searching for a specific page or website\nCommercial: When someone is looking to learn more before making a purchase\nTransactional: When someone is intending to complete an action or purchase\n\nTo quickly find a keyword’s intent, head to Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool. \n\nEnter your keyword, choose your target country, and hit “Search.” \n\nThen, refer to the box labeled “Intent.”\n\nOur example shows that “oatmeal cookie” has informational intent. So, people are probably looking for recipes.\n\nYou can get more insight into intent by looking at the search engine results page (SERP).\n\nJust scroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section and click “View SERP.” \n\nAs you can see, the “oatmeal cookie” SERP is indeed dominated by recipes. So, you probably won’t rank well with a transactional page.\n\nAnalyze Search Intent\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Leverage Primary Keywords\n\nA primary keyword is the main search term you want a page to rank for.\n\nBy using the primary keyword strategically, you can optimize your page for search engines. And get better rankings.\n\nWe recommend that you include your primary keyword (or something very close to it) in the following locations:\n\nTitle tag: The HTML page title that can appear in the SERP\nMeta description: The HTML page summary that can appear in the SERP\nH1 tag: The HTML tag that contains the main on-page heading\nBody content: The main content on the page\nURL slug: the unique part of the page’s address\n\nYou can also optimize for secondary keywords—particularly in the body content. These represent other ways that people search for pages like yours. \n\nFor example, if your primary keyword is “oatmeal cookie” then secondary keywords could include:\n\nhow to make oatmeal cookies\noatmeal cookie recipe\neasy oatmeal cookies\n\nTo choose the target keywords for a page, you need to perform SEO keyword research.\n\nTry it out with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nEnter a main term to base your search around, choose your target country, and click “Search.”\n\nBy default, the tool will present “Broad Match” results that include your starting keyword or a close variation. And a variety of useful metrics.\n\nGenerally, your primary keyword should be the one that best represents the overall theme of the page and has the highest search volume (average number of monthly searches).\n\nBut, you may also want to consider keyword difficulty (KD %). This percentage indicates how hard it’ll be to earn a high organic ranking—one that’s more likely to get views and clicks.\n\nSo, an authoritative recipe site might choose “oatmeal cookie recipe” (66% difficulty) as the primary keyword for their oatmeal cookie recipe.\n\nWhereas a new blogger might be better off targeting “coconut oil oatmeal cookies“ (18% difficulty). \n\n(To cater to search intent, the blogger will need to use coconut oil in their recipe.)\n\nTo learn more, check out our guide on choosing keywords for SEO.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Write Compelling Title Tags and Meta Descriptions\n\nWhen optimizing a page for search, you should write a compelling title tag (HTML page title) and meta description (HTML page summary).\n\nBecause both elements have the potential to appear in SERPs.\n\nLike this:\n\nWhich means they can have a significant impact on clicks.\n\nPlus, Google uses your title tag to better understand what your page is about. If the tag doesn’t include your primary keyword, it may suggest that your page isn’t a relevant result.\n\nHere are some good SEO practices for title tags and meta descriptions:\n\nMake sure they’re unique\nInclude your primary keyword, ideally near the front\nStick to 50-60 characters for titles and around 105 characters for descriptions to reduce the risk of text being cut off in the SERP\nUse calls to action (e.g., “ Shop now”) to convince users to click through\nDemonstrate that your page will satisfy search intent\nIncorporate strong benefits (e.g., “free delivery”) to help your result stand out\n\nTip\n\nUse the On Page SEO Checker to see how well your current content is optimized. The tool will let you know about missing title tags, missing meta descriptions, and much more.\n \n\n4. Optimize Your Images\n\nImage optimization can help to improve your overall rankings and user experience. But it can also help you earn valuable exposure in image results.\n\nLike this:\n\nHere are four best practices for image SEO:\n\nChoose the Best File Format \n\nFile format is important because it affects the size, quality, and accessibility of your images.\n\nThe most commonly used image formats on the web are JPEG and PNG. \n\nBoth formats use different compression techniques. Which is why the file sizes between these two can be dramatically different.\n\nLike so:\n\nLooking at the difference in file sizes above, it would be easy to declare JPEG as the winner. But it would be a mistake.\n\nWhile JPEGs look great for photographs, PNGs are best suited for images that contain text, line drawings, etc. \n\nWebP is another popular option. It’s a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for web images. \n\nWebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs and 34% smaller than comparable JPEGs, according to Google. \n\nLearn more about how to use WebP in this Google guide.\n\nCompress Your Images\n\nImage compression is a process applied to images to minimize their size without degrading quality. \n\nImages are often the largest contributor to overall page size and loading time. And page speed is an important Google ranking factor.\n\nIn other words, the larger your image file size, the longer it takes your page to load. \n\nSo it’s really important to compress your images before you upload them to your site.\n\nHere are free tools that can help:\n\nTinyPNG: uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your PNG and JPEG files\nImageOptim: by far the best tool for compressing images on a Mac\nShortPixel: a great WordPress plugin for automatically compressing images \nProvide Alt Text for Images\n\nAlt text (short for alternative text) is text included in HTML code to describe an image on a webpage. \n\nIt provides context for search engine crawlers and those viewing a page with a screen reader.\n\nLike this:\n\nDespite advances in Google’s ability to understand images, adding alt text is still an SEO best practice. \n\nMake sure to:\n\nAdd alt text to all functional images\nDescribe the image as if you were describing it over the phone\nKeep descriptions under 125 characters\nInclude target keywords, where relevant\nDon’t include unnecessary terms like “image of” or “picture of”\n\nTo find and fix missing alt text, use Semrush’s Site Audit tool. \n\nStart by creating a project and then clicking on the “Issues” tab. \n\nThen, narrow down your results by searching for “alt attributes” only. \n\nLike so:\n\nClick the “# images” link to see all the affected image URLs.\n\nYou can then log into your site and add the optimized alt text.\n\nLazy-Load Your Images\n\nLazy loading is a technique in app and web development that defers the loading of non-critical resources (images, videos, etc.) at page load time. \n\nImages and videos are loaded only when users need them.\n\nHere’s how Google explains the link between lazy loading and site performance:\n\n“When we lazy load images and video, we reduce initial page load time, initial page weight, and system resource usage, all of which have positive impacts on performance.”\n\nYou may be able to use a plugin to enable lazy loading on your site. If you need help, speak to a developer.\n\n5. Optimize Your Site’s Page Loading Speed \n\nPage loading speed is very important for Google. Especially on mobile. \n\nWhich is why we recommend making your site load as quickly as possible. \n\nTo analyze your site’s speed, use our Site Audit tool.\n\nFirst, create a new project (if you haven’t already done so). Then, look for “Site Performance” and click on “View details.”\n\nNext, see and address all the errors and warnings under “Performance Issues.”\n\nThese are all the issues on your site that are preventing it from loading faster. \n\nYou can also click on “# issues” to see more about the issue and how to fix it. \n\nIf you do, you’ll see a list of the affected URLs and their load times.\n\nLike this:\n\nAlternatively, use Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool. \n\nStart by entering your URL. Then clicking “Analyze.”\n\nYou’ll see a dashboard with your site’s overall health. And a detailed report with all the ways you can improve. \n\n6. Build an Internal Linking Structure\n\nInternal links (links between pages on your site) are important because they help users and search engines to navigate your site. And understand how pages relate to each other.\n\nWhen used correctly, internal links may boost your rankings.\n\nYou can check the internal links on your site with the Site Audit tool. \n\nAfter setting up, look for the “Internal Linking” box. And click on “View details.”\n\nThen, see and address all errors and warnings under “Internal Link Issues.”\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n7. Improve User Experience \n\nGoogle cares about how users engage with pages. As such, user experience (UX) is a key factor in helping improve search rankings. \n\nPage speed plays a key role in improving UX. But it’s just a starting point. \n\nHere are a few other SEO tips to ensure that users have a good experience when they visit your site:\n\nUse headers and subheadings. Proper use of headers and subheadings (H1, H2, H3) helps Google understand your content better and makes your text more accessible to readers.\nMake your content visually appealing. Visuals help readers understand your content better. Use relevant images, videos, and screenshots to help get your point across.\nAvoid using intrusive pop-ups. Pop-ups are annoying your visitors. Since 2017, Google has penalized sites that use intrusive pop-ups. So it’s best to use them sparingly.\nUse white space. White space is fundamental for good design. According to the Interaction Design Foundation, white space improves legibility, branding, and focus. \nMake your site mobile-friendly. Mobile-friendliness is critical for UX and because Google uses mobile-first indexing. You can use Google’s mobile-friendly test to see how your site performs.\n8. Make Your URLs SEO-Friendly \n\nA good URL structure gives users and search engines an idea of what the destination page is about. \n\nConsider organizing your content so that URLs are constructed logically. And in a manner that is intelligible to humans. \n\nWith that in mind, here is how you can start creating well-structured URLs:\n\nUse short URLs. A Backlinko study found that short URLs tend to outperform long URLs in SERPs.\nInclude your target keyword. Always include your target keywords in the URL to increase your chances of ranking better in search results. \nInclude categories or subfolders if necessary. For example, if you’re selling goods, you may have a “shop” subcategory. This helps users navigate your site.\n9. Earn Authoritative Backlinks\n\nGoogle recognizes certain kinds of backlinks (links that point from other sites to yours) as “votes of confidence.”\n\nIf your webpages have many authoritative backlinks, they’re more likely to rank well on the SERPs.\n\nThat said, not all backlinks are created equal. \n\nSome backlinks can boost your ranking for specific search queries exponentially. While others may be harmful.\n\nYou should focus your efforts on building high-quality backlinks that can improve your chances of ranking higher for your target keywords. \n\nOne of the most effective ways to obtain authoritative backlinks is by replicating your competitors’ link building strategies.\n\nTo start, go to Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool.\n\nEnter your competitor’s domain and go to the “Indexed Pages” tab. \n\nYou’ll see a table with all of your competitor’s pages sorted by number of referring domains (i.e., websites linking to it). \n\nLook for patterns in the top pages’ topics, style, length, and format. \n\nFor example:\n\nWhat does your competitor write about?\nIs the format more long-form or short?\nDo they use a lot of visual assets?\n\nThe answers to these questions should guide your content strategy. Replicate what’s working in a better or similar way.\n\n10. Create Useful Content \n\nGoogle encourages site owners to publish unique, useful content that’s made for people—not search engines.\n\nThis is the type of content that Google strives to rank highest in search results.\n\nSo, create content that solves your audiences’ pain points and leaves them feeling satisfied.\n\nHere are some quick tips for success:\n\nMake sure your content is written and/or reviewed by an expert in the field\nStick to topics that your brand may be perceived as an authority in\nCheck that all the information you provide is accurate and up to date\nEnsure your writing is free of spelling, punctuation, and grammar errors\nUse charts, images, videos, etc. to present information in the most effective way\nAdd subheadings, line spaces, contents lists, etc. to make your content easy to navigate\n\nYou can then apply on-page SEO techniques to make your content search-friendly.\n\nSemrush’s SEO Writing Assistant will help keep you on the right track.\n\nEnter your target keywords, choose your target country, and start writing. \n\nThen, the tool will then provide suggestions related to SEO, originality, tone of voice, and readability.\n\nIf you get stuck, the built-in AI tools can help you out.\n\nJust head to the “Smart Writer” box. Or click highlighted text to use a shortcut.\n\nReview Your Drafts in Real Time\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign Up Now →\nFAQs \nWhat Are Some Common Best SEO Practices?\n\nSome good SEO practices include the following:\n\nOptimizing website structure and content\nUsing relevant and descriptive keywords\nCreating high-quality and valuable content\nBuilding high-quality backlinks\nOptimizing website speed and mobile-friendliness\nRegularly updating and maintaining your website\nWill My Website Automatically Rank Well if I Follow All SEO Best Practices?\n\nFollowing SEO best practices alone does not guarantee good SEO results for your website.
