And potentially secure buy-in and budget for your own SEO strategy. \n\n1. SEO Is the Most-Used B2B Marketing Tactic\n\nNearly 50% of B2B companies use SEO as part of their marketing strategies, according to a 2023 report from Sagefrog. Which makes it the most-implemented B2B marketing tactic and ahead of other activities like video marketing (21%) and organic social media (43%).\n\nThis means your competitors are likely doing some form of SEO. And if you aren’t, you’ll want to start incorporating it into your marketing activities to outrank them in search results.\n\nHere’s a more comprehensive list of B2B marketing activities that Sagefrog evaluated:\n\nMarketing Activity\n\n\t\n\n% of B2B Companies\n\n\n\n\nSearch engine optimization\n\n\t\n\n49%\n\n\n\n\nContent marketing\n\n\t\n\n43%\n\n\n\n\nOrganic social media\n\n\t\n\n43%\n\n\n\n\nEmail marketing\n\n\t\n\n36%\n\n\n\n\nPaid social media\n\n\t\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\nIn-person tradeshows\n\n\t\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\nVirtual events and webinars\n\n\t\n\n28%\n\n\n\n\nSearch engine marketing\n\n\t\n\n27%\n\n\n\n\nPublic relations\n\n\t\n\n27%\n\n\n\n\nVideo marketing\n\n\t\n\n21%\n\n\n\n\nDirect marketing\n\n\t\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\nTelemarketing\n\n\t\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\nPrint advertisements\n\n\t\n\n12%\n\n2. 66% of B2B Buyers Use Search as Their Main Product Research Method\n\nA survey from BigCommerce shows B2B buyers in the U.S. often turn to search engines when they begin their customer journey—the process buyers go through before buying products\n\nHere’s a simplified version of what that process looks like:\n\nOther top channels buyers use include online marketplaces (50%) and industry associations (42%):\n\nChannel \n\n\t\n\n% of U.S. B2B Buyers\n\n\n\n\nInternet search results\n\n\t\n\n66%\n\n\n\n\nOnline marketplaces (e.g., Amazon)\n\n\t\n\n50%\n\n\n\n\nIndustry associations\n\n\t\n\n42%\n\n\n\n\nProduct catalog\n\n\t\n\n43%\n\n\n\n\nReferrals\n\n\t\n\n33%\n\n\n\n\nOnline advertisements \n\n\t\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\nIndustry publications\n\n\t\n\n29%\n\n\n\n\nTrade shows\n\n\t\n\n23%\n\n\n\n\nPhysical advertising\n\n\t\n\n24%\n\n\n\n\nSocial media advertising\n\n\t\n\n23%\n\n\n\n\nTV advertising\n\n\t\n\n14%\n\nYou can target B2B buyers at the start of their journeys by optimizing your site with top-of-funnel keywords—terms your ideal customers are searching when they’ve become aware of their problems.\n\nTo find top-of-funnel keywords, use Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nOpen the tool and enter a seed keyword—a general keyword relevant to your niche. Enter your website in the bar below, adjust your country (optional), and click “Search.”\n\nClick the “Intent” filter, select the checkbox next to “Informational,” and click “Apply.”\n\nYou’ll see only terms that have informational search intent. \n\nThis means the main reason someone is searching those terms is to learn about a topic. And those types of searches tend to be at the top of the funnel.\n\nThe tool will also display each term’s monthly search volume and Personal Keyword Difficulty (PKD%) score—how hard it will be for your specific site to rank well for those keywords. \n\nGo through these keywords and choose ones that are most relevant to your business (and relatively easy to rank for).\n\nThen, create pages on your website that target these keywords. \n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3.

And for good reason—Gartner’s research shows 30% of B2B buyers read blog posts at different stages in the buyer’s journey.\n\nThis is more than those who click on ads (24%) and watch virtual product demos (29%).\n\nAnd you can use blog posts to link to other pages on your site (known as internal links). Which is the most important channel—37% of B2B buyers engage with a supplier’s website.\n\nChannel \n\n\t\n\n% of B2B Buyers\n\n\n\n\nSupplier's website\n\n\t\n\n37%\n\n\n\n\nSupplier's social media\n\n\t\n\n36%\n\n\n\n\nOnline search for suppliers\n\n\t\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\nSupplier’s interactive tool\n\n\t\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\nSupplier's customer portal\n\n\t\n\n34% \n\n\n\n\nSupplier's virtual product\n\n\t\n\n30%\n\n\n\n\nTraining supplier's email\n\n\t\n\n30%\n\n\n\n\nSupplier's virtual event\n\n\t\n\n30% \n\n\n\n\nSupplier's blog\n\n\t\n\n30%\n\n\n\n\nSupplier's video ad\n\n\t\n\n29%\n\n\n\n\nVirtual product demo\n\n\t\n\n29%\n\n\n\n\nClicked on supplier's ad\n\n\t\n\n24%\n\nPlus, adding strategic internal links can help you rank higher. As internal links from authoritative pages can pass ranking authority to other pages on your site.\n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit to find pages on your site that need more links pointing to them. \n\nOpen the tool, enter your domain, and click “Start Audit.”\n\nConfigure the tool for your site. (Follow our configuration instructions if you need help.)\n\nOnce the audit is done, locate “Internal Linking” and click “View details.”\n\nLook for the text “Pages with only one internal link” and click “# issues.”\n\nYou’ll now see a list of pages that only have a single link pointing to them. \n\nAdd more links to these pages from elsewhere on your site. To increase these pages’ visibility and likelihood of ranking in search results.\n\n10.
