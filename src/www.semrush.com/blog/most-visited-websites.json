August, the top 100 U.S. websites showed varied performance in terms of traffic. Overall, traffic to leading sites increased by an average of 1.9% month-over-month (MoM), signaling a modest rise in user engagement across multiple platforms.\n\nSome of the biggest winners included instructure.com, which saw a massive traffic jump of 51.7%. ESPN.com also experienced significant growth, rising by 25.2%. Outbrain.com followed closely with a 26.2% increase. Craigslist.org saw its traffic grow by 13.4%, while Chase.com recorded a 10.2% rise.\n\nOn the other hand, several websites saw notable traffic declines. NBCNews.com experienced a sharp drop of 18.1%, and traffic to weather.com decreased by 16.4%. Temu.com also faced challenges, with its traffic down by 14.1%. Amazon.com saw a 5.3% decrease, while x.com recorded a 3.7% decline.\n\nTech platforms had mixed results. While ebay.com saw a 10.1% surge in traffic, other sites like microsoft.com experienced only modest gains, with a 1.2% increase. Some, like apple.com and roblox.com, saw slight declines, with traffic dropping by 2.9% and 3.1%, respectively.\n\nNews and media outlets struggled throughout the month. CNN.com’s traffic fell by 8.7%, and Newsweek.com posted a similar decline at 8.8%. Although a few sites, like usatoday.com, saw growth (5.4%), most news platforms recorded moderate declines.\n\nE-commerce sites showed volatility as well. While etsy.com saw its traffic rise by 8.4% and paypal.com increased by 5.1%, other major players like walmart.com and target.com saw slight decreases, with declines of 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively.\n\nOverall, August presented challenges for many sites, particularly in the media, e-commerce, and technology sectors. September will reveal whether these trends continue and how well these sites can recover and boost engagement.\n\nIt’s Not Just About the Traffic\n\nAlthough observing position changes through traffic volume can help to analyze global trends and benchmark your performance against the competition, Semrush’s Traffic Analytics reports also include important metrics to keep watch on:\n\n•\nMobile vs. desktop traffic share shows which devices people use to enter a site page. When doing competitive benchmarking, this metric can help to determine whether you need to implement certain steps (e.g. ensure further mobile optimization or come up with additional desktop traffic generation tactics) to strengthen your traffic acquisition strategy and stay in the game.\n•\nNumber of pages per visit, average visit duration, and bounce rate reflect the quality of site content. If you spot that your competitor’s website shows better performance, it's a sign that you have to work on your SEO and content strategy, comparing the structure, content, and design of your site pages against theirs.\nExplore traffic patterns in your industry with Open .Trends\nGet insights\nInsights on the Most Popular Sites in the US by Industry\n\nTo spot more granular market patterns and provide more useful insights, we decided to show the leading U.S. websites in terms of traffic volume by different industries: Education, Fashion, Travel, Retail, Teamwork, Social Networks, Media, Food Delivery, and Streaming Services.\n\nEducation\nFashion\nTravel\nRetail\nTeamwork\nSocial Networks\nMedia\nFood Delivery\nStreaming Services\nEducation\nUnited States, August 2024\n0\n50M\n100M\n150M\n242M\ninstructure.com\nclever.com\nquizlet.com\npowerschool.com\nblackboard.com\nschoology.com\nduolingo.com\npearson.com\nkhanacademy.org\nmheducation.com\n220M\n47M\n43M\n27M\n26M\n22M\n20M\n17M\n16M\n16M\nThe Most Visited Websites - US, Education Category\n\nAugust was a highly successful month for the education sector, which saw a significant 60.1% month-over-month (MoM) traffic surge, with 80% of the top sites experiencing growth.\n\nLeading the pack were Schoology.com and Clever.com, both of which saw massive traffic increases of 369.3% and 311.4%, respectively.
