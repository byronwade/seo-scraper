  "content": "Content is one of the biggest variables of online marketing success. The more (high-quality and relevant) content you produce, the more growth opportunities you’ll discover.\n\nBut what kind of content should you create?\n\nWhat topics should you talk about?\n\nFinding fresh ideas for content creation can be challenging. But it doesn’t have to be. \n\nIn this article, we’ll show you how to find ideas for content using AI tools, analytics, and other tried-and-tested tactics.\n\nHere are 28 ways to come up with content ideas for your website and social media:\n\n1. Use Content Idea Generators\n\nContent idea generators are tools that help you brainstorm content topics. You can use them to generate hundreds of content ideas instantly.\n\nYou just need to enter a broad topic or keyword related to your industry or offerings. And the tool will provide you with a list of potential topics that are popular and trending.\n\nSemrush’s Topic Research is a popular content idea generator you can use to get fresh ideas.\n\nHere’s how: \n\nOpen the tool, enter a topic, and choose your target location. (This is the country and city you want to target.) \n\nClick “Get content ideas.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of potential content ideas displayed in card-style format.\n\nClick any card to see the top headlines from around the web, popular questions people ask Google, and related searches.\n\nGo through the list of topics. Add the ones that look relevant as favorites by clicking the favorites icon to the right of the headline.\n\nThis will store all your favorite ideas under a separate tab called “Favorite Ideas.”\n\nBy the end, you’ll have plenty of ideas for content. \n\nEven better: \n\nThese ideas are ones that people (aka your target audience) are looking for on Google.\n\nFind New Content Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Conduct Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research can give you insights into your audience’s most pressing questions and interests.\n\nStart with a broad topic or “seed” term related to your industry or business.\n\nFor instance, if you’re in sales or business technology, your seed term could be “sales CRM.” Using this term, you can uncover more specific, long-tail queries, such as “What is CRM in sales?”\n\nThis will help you curate content ideas that align with what your target audience is actively seeking and provide targeted solutions to their specific queries.\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool can help you find keyword suggestions in seconds.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your seed term, choose a target location, and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see this report:\n\nTry clicking “Exact match” from the list of filters at the top. This will give you a list of keywords closely related to your specific term. \n\nFor example, “sales CRM” will show queries exactly matching this phrase. They will help you find highly relevant content ideas.\n\nNext, click “Related.” This will give you a list of keywords similar to your seed term. \n\nThe keywords may or may not include your seed term. They will help you find broader content ideas.\n\nFinally, click “Questions” > “Broad match.” This will give you a list of question-based keywords that include any variation of your seed term and in any order. \n\nTypically, this is where you’ll find a lot of content ideas.\n\nGo through the list and select the keywords you think would be suitable for creating content.\n\nAlso, look at the “Volume” and keyword difficulty or “KD %” of the keywords you select.\n\nVolume: This is the estimated number of average monthly searches for a keyword over a 12-month period. Higher volume indicates more search interest.\nKeyword Difficulty (KD %): Ranging from 0 to 100, this metric shows how hard it would be to rank for a keyword. Lower KD % suggests easier ranking potential, while higher KD % indicates more competition.\n\nPick relevant keywords with high search volume and low difficulty. Content built around these keywords will have more potential to rank higher faster and drive more organic traffic.\n\nGet Keyword Suggestions for Content Ideas\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Look at Your Competitors’ Content Strategies\n\nExamining your competitors’ content lets you identify gaps and opportunities in your own content plan.\n\nStart by exploring their websites and blogs. Observe which topics they cover and the types of content they produce (such as videos, articles, and infographics).\n\nFor example, suppose a competitor’s blog series on a specific topic is driving a lot of organic traffic. In that case, it might indicate a strong interest in that topic among your shared audience.\n\nThe goal here isn’t to replicate their content but to understand what interests your target audience and how you can fill in the gaps or offer a unique perspective.\n\nThis way, you can create content that stands out—by offering your audience something different or more in-depth than your competitors.\n\nYou can find your competitors’ best-performing website content using Semrush’s Organic Research tool.\n\nHere’s how to come up with content ideas using Organic Research:\n\nOpen the tool, enter your competitor’s domain, select the target location, and hit “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see this overview report:\n\nNavigate to the “Pages” tab from the list of tabs at the top.\n\nHere, you’ll find the pages on your competitor’s site, sorted by the estimated high to low organic traffic. \n\nLook at the pages bringing the website the most traffic. What topics are they on? Can you create content on those topics?\n\nYou can even look at the keywords driving organic traffic to individual pages. Just click the number of keywords in the “Keywords” column corresponding to each URL.\n\nNow, you’ll see a list of keywords that specific page is ranking for and how much traffic those keywords attract.\n\nIdeally, based on this competitive analysis, you want to select topics that are:\n\nWorking best for your competitor (in terms of driving traffic)\nRelevant to your target audience\nOptimized with keywords that are relatively easier to rank for\n4. Analyze Your Most Popular Blog Posts\n\nReview your website’s analytics to see which articles have the highest views, shares, or comments. This data is a clear indicator of the topics your readers prefer. \n\nFor instance, if a post like “5 Essential Tips for First-Time Home Buyers” is receiving significant traffic and interaction, it indicates that your audience is largely first-time buyers looking for comprehensive, easy-to-understand guidance.\n\nSuch insights can shape your content strategy to focus more on detailed guides, step-by-step processes, and perhaps even personal stories of first-time homebuying experiences.\n\nSo, creating more posts around home buying and residential property investment tips can be a strategic move to keep your audience engaged and coming back for more.\n\nYou can find top pages on your site using Google Analytics.\n\nGo to your Google Analytics account, click “Reports” > “Engagement” > “Pages and screens.”\n\nYou can keep your content strategy aligned with your audience’s evolving interests and needs by regularly reviewing Google Analytics data.\n\n5. Try ChatGPT\n\nYou can use ChatGPT to brainstorm fresh content ideas. The AI tool can generate topics, headlines, and rough outlines for your articles. \n\nStart by giving it a prompt related to your field. \n\nFor example, if you’re in the travel industry, you might ask: \n\n“I want to write an article about solo traveling with the goal of getting hotel bookings through my affiliate links. Can you give me 10 content ideas for articles that will achieve those goals?” \n\nChatGPT will generate a range of ideas based on your prompt. \n\nYou can refine these suggestions, combine them, or use them as a starting point for more detailed research. \n\nChatGPT is particularly useful when you’re looking for fresh angles on familiar topics.\n\nKeep in mind: The more specific your prompt, the more tailored the responses will be.\n\nFurther reading: 195 ChatGPT Prompts (& How to Write Your Own)\n\n6. Use ContentShake AI\n\nContentShake AI is a comprehensive writing tool that assists in the entire content creation process. It doesn’t just give you ideas; it even composes unique content for you in seconds.\n\nThe tool uses AI and machine learning to give you tailored topics.\n\nYou can generate content ideas with ContentShake AI by entering a seed keyword related to your business, product, or industry.\n\nYou’ll also see suggestions for related tags. Once you choose the desired tags, click “Start writing.”\n\nThe tool generates a list of potential article ideas.\n\nIt categorizes the ideas by search intent, which is the underlying purpose or goal of a user’s search query. \n\nThere are four broad types of search intent:\n\nNavigational: The user aims to find a specific website or page, like “Facebook login”\nInformational: The user seeks information or answers to questions, such as “How to tie a tie”\nCommercial: The user looks for information before making a purchase decision, like “best smartphones 2024”\nTransactional: The user intends to complete a specific action or purchase, such as “buy iPhone 12 online”\n\nReview the ideas and click the one you’re interested in creating content for.\n\nNext, click “Start writing.” ContentShake AI will generate the first draft of your article. \n\nYou’ll find several data points and recommendations. Like what keywords you can add to the text to optimize it better or what sentences can be reworked for better readability. \n\nYou can improve your first draft by editing and optimizing it. \n\nOnce the content is finalized, you can even publish the article directly to your WordPress blog.\n\n7. Join Social Media Conversations\n\nSocial media conversations within your industry or niche are a goldmine of content generation ideas.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they help you understand your audience’s interests and preferences. And based on that, you can develop interesting content ideas.\n\nFor instance, if you’re in finance, join Facebook groups dedicated to money-saving.\n\nOr follow hashtags like #FinanceTips on Instagram.\n\nWhen observing these platforms, you might find that discussions about “budget-friendly investment strategies” are gaining traction, with increased questions and engagement on such posts.\n\nThis isn’t just casual conversation; it reflects a keen interest among your audience in this area right now.\n\nYou can leverage this information by creating content that directly addresses these interests.\n\nFor example, based on the active discussions, you could write a blog post titled “5 Budget-Friendly Investment Strategies for 2024” or produce a series of Instagram posts offering quick tips on the subject.\n\nThis ensures your content resonates strongly with your audience’s current concerns and interests.\n\n8. Talk to Industry Thought Leaders\n\nEngaging with industry thought leaders can be a rich source of content ideas on emerging topics.\n\nThese interactions provide firsthand expert knowledge and add credibility and depth to your content.\n\nYou can use these insights to create detailed articles, reports, Q&A sessions, or expert roundup posts, offering diverse perspectives from the forefront of your industry.\n\nFor example, Semrush recently published a detailed social media trends report for 2024. It features several of the industry’s leading names who gave their opinions and insights.\n\nTo reach out to experts for interviews, consider using professional networks like LinkedIn, attending industry conferences where thought leaders speak, or participating in online webinars and forums related to your field.\n\nThese platforms offer opportunities to connect with experts whom you can then request interviews with or invite to share their insights.\n\nThis way, you not only curate valuable content for your audience but also build your network within the industry.\n\n9. Read Key Opinion Leaders’ Interviews\n\nAnalyzing interviews of key opinion leaders (KOLs) in your industry can reveal insightful content ideas. \n\nYou can find these interviews in industry magazines, podcasts, or YouTube channels. \n\nPay attention to the topics they discuss, the predictions they make, and the advice they give. \n\nFor instance, here’s a takeaway from an interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman:\n\nIf you’re in a tech-related niche, you can create many pieces of content based on this interview. \n\nFor instance, you could write a prediction-based article like “How AI Will Impact Employment in the Next 5 Years,” providing an in-depth look at future trends.\n\nAlternatively, a listicle such as “10 Ways AI is Transforming the Hiring Process” can offer readers a concise overview of the changes to expect in the coming years.\n\nFollowing KOLs helps you stay on top of industry trends and provides your audience with cutting-edge information.\n\n10. Explore Google Search Suggestions\n\nGoogle Search suggestions (also called autocomplete) are a quick way to identify what people are searching for in real-time. \n\nWhen you start typing a topic into Google’s search bar, it automatically suggests related search terms based on popular queries. You can use these suggestions to find highly targeted content ideas. \n\nFor example, typing “healthy eating” might bring up suggestions like “healthy eating plate” or “healthy eating for kids.” \n\nThis gives you a direct look at what people are currently interested in—allowing you to create content that is both relevant and likely to perform well in search results. \n\nFrom the example of “healthy eating for kids,” you could create a variety of engaging content. \n\nConsider a video series showing how to make fun, colorful, and healthy food plates that appeal to children. Or, compile a listicle of quick, nutritious recipes ideal for kids’ meals.\n\nYou can further explore these topics using tools like Google Trends to gauge their popularity over time.\n\nTip\n\nLearn more about how to use Google Trends in our comprehensive Google Trends guide.\n\n11. Learn from Google Search Console Data\n\nGoogle Search Console (GSC) gives a clear picture of what draws visitors to your site. It shows the queries people use to find your site and how it appears in search results.\n\nYou can identify topics already resonating with your audience by analyzing this data.\n\nFor instance, if you find that a lot of traffic comes from searches related to “beginner yoga poses,” it may be a sign to create more content around yoga for beginners. \n\nThis could include a detailed article on “Yoga Poses for Stress Relief” with instructional photos and a “10-Minute Yoga Routines for Beginners” video for social media.\n\nThis targeted approach ensures your content is relevant and meets your audience’s needs and interests.\n\n12. Share Your Personal Experiences\n\nYour personal experiences can be a powerful source of content. \n\nSharing your journey, challenges, and successes makes your content relatable and can resonate with your audience. \n\nFor example, if you run a small business, dive into the practicalities of its day-to-day operations. This could include insights into effective team management, the process of product development, or the strategies you’ve implemented for customer retention.\n\nSharing these operational details provides a glimpse into the realities of managing a business and offers valuable lessons drawn from your own experiences.\n\nHere’s Joel Gascoigne, CEO and co-founder of Buffer, sharing his behind-the-scene thoughts on the company’s blog:\n\nThe personal touch differentiates your content from others and establishes a stronger connection with your readers. \n\nIt can inspire, educate, and encourage engagement. Making your website or social channels a source of genuine insights and stories.\n\n13. Subscribe to Industry Newsletters\n\nSubscribing to industry newsletters is a smart way to stay informed and get inspired. These newsletters often cover your field’s latest trends, breakthroughs, and updates.\n\nRegularly reading them lets you stay ahead of the curve and find new angles for your content.\n\nFor instance, if you’re in the digital marketing field, subscribing to newsletters like Marketing Brew can provide you with a steady stream of current topics, such as the latest viral ads or social media trends. \n\nThis information can spark content-generation ideas for timely articles and videos. Possibly even helping you to become a thought leader in your niche.\n\nYou can create content that not only addresses current trends but also offers analysis, predictions, or new perspectives. This helps establish your authority and expertise.\n\nOver time, consistently producing well-informed, forward-thinking content can elevate your status to that of a thought leader, making you a go-to source for insights and commentary in your industry.\n\n14. Use Content Curation Tools\n\nContent curation tools, such as Feedly and Pocket, help you easily keep up with the latest trends and topics in your industry.\n\nThese tools work by letting you build a personalized feed.\n\nYou can add sources by searching for specific blogs and websites or by importing their RSS feeds.\n\nOnce you’ve added these sources, the tools automatically collect and show you the latest articles and posts from them.\n\nThis means you get a constantly updated stream of information tailored to your interests and industry.\n\nFor example, if you’re involved in the environmental sector, you might use Feedly to follow well-known blogs and news sites about green living.\n\nThis allows you to quickly spot trending topics in your field.\n\nFor instance, you might come across articles on the latest sustainable living practices or innovations in eco-friendly products.\n\nWith this information, you can create relevant content such as “Top Sustainable Living Trends of the Year” or “Innovative Eco-Friendly Products Changing the Market,” ensuring your content is timely, informative, and aligned with what’s currently being talked about in the green living space.\n\n15. Draw Inspiration from YouTube Channels\n\nFollow YouTube channels related to your niche to see what topics are popular and how they are presented visually. This can be an excellent source for content ideas.\n\nFor instance, if you are in the fashion industry, watching popular fashion vloggers and content creators (like Justine Leconte, a popular fashion designer) can give you insights into current styles, consumer preferences, and industry trends. \n\nYou can use these insights to create content that complements these trends, such as blog posts on “The Top Fashion Trends of the Season” or “How to Style Everyday Outfits.” \n\nYouTube channels can also inspire ideas for format and presentation, helping you to diversify your content types, like incorporating video blogs or photo essays into your strategy.\n\n16. Listen to Podcasts Related to Your Niche\n\nNiche podcasts often feature in-depth discussions, interviews with experts, and analysis of current trends. They can be a rich source of content ideas. \n\nRegularly listening to these podcasts can give you a deeper understanding of your industry and what interests your audience. \n\nFor example, if you’re in a business niche, listening to podcasts like “My First Million” or “The GaryVee Audio Experience” can inspire content ideas related to marketing, startups, funding, and more.\n\nThe topics discussed in these podcasts can be turned into blog posts, social media posts, infographics, or even guidebooks, providing your audience valuable information in the preferred format.\n\n17. Stay Updated on the Latest Product Launches\n\nStaying current with your industry’s latest technology and product releases can provide many ideas for website content.\n\nWebsites like TechCrunch, CNET, and Product Hunt can be excellent resources for staying informed about the latest gadgets, software, or services related to your industry. \n\nFor example, a TechCrunch article like the one shown below can be a source of new content ideas.\n\nYou can create articles focused on emerging tools that aid in travel planning.\n\nYou can write a detailed review of Pilot, exploring its features and benefits. Or produce a how-to guide on making the most of AI-based travel tools.\n\nAlso, comparison articles evaluating different AI travel planning solutions can be insightful for your audience.\n\nThis strategy of creating content around new product launches ensures your articles are both informative and relevant to current industry trends.\n\n18. Leverage Insights from Recent Studies\n\nIncorporating insights from recent studies can add credibility and depth to your content. \n\nLook for recent research or surveys in your field—in academic journals, industry reports, or news articles.\n\nFor instance, if you cover health and wellness, a new study on meditation could be the basis for an informative article, video, and social media posts. \n\nFor the study above, you could create an article like “New Study Shows Daily Meditation Doesn’t Change Brain Structure.”\n\nUsing data from studies helps back your content with authoritative sources, making it more trustworthy and informative for your audience.\n\n19. Engage with Your Existing Customers\n\nUnderstanding existing customers’ experiences, needs, and pain points gives you a direct insight into what content will most benefit them.\n\nSo, direct interaction with them is an effective way to find content creating ideas. You can do this through surveys, feedback forms, or Zoom conversations.\n\nFor a fitness equipment business, direct feedback might highlight a need for more information on effective home workout routines. \n\nIn response, you could create a series of instructional posts or videos like “Maximizing Your Home Gym: Effective Routines with [Your Product].”\n\nThis approach ensures your content is relevant and strengthens customer relationships by showing that you value their feedback.\n\n20. Discover New Content Ideas on Reddit\n\nReddit is a vibrant platform for uncovering diverse social and website content ideas. With its myriad of communities (called subreddits), you can find discussions on almost any topic imaginable. \n\nJoin subreddits that align with your niche to see what topics are trending and what questions are being asked. \n\nFor example, if you’re into gardening, you can go to the r/gardening subreddit and filter the results to see the top discussions in the past week, month, and year.\n\nIn the screenshot above, you can see a post on dragon fruits has received over 52,000 upvotes, which shows interest in the topic.\n\nYou can use that topic to create a range of guides and articles, like:\n\nHow to Grow Dragon Fruit on Your Rooftop Garden\nGrow Dragon Fruit Plant in Your Backyard Garden in 5 Steps\n10 Plants You Can Grow on Your Back Patio\n\nThe advantage of Reddit is its real-time, community-driven content, offering you a pulse on what’s currently engaging and thought-provoking in your industry. You can sort the results to see top posts “This Week” and you’ll find new content ideas every week.\n\n21. Participate in Online Forum Discussions\n\nDiving into online forums like Quora is another effective way to curate ideas for content creation. Unlike Reddit (a broader community platform), Quora is specifically designed for asking and answering questions. \n\nThis makes it an excellent place to understand what people are curious about in your niche. \n\nFor instance, if you specialize in personal finance, you can search “Personal Finance” on Quora to see a list of questions people have asked on the subject.\n\nPro tip\n\nSort the results by time to look at the most popular questions of the past week, month, and year.\n\nFor example, in the screenshot below, you can see “What are the ten most important things about personal finance that someone without a finance background must know?” is a very popular question that has over 2,600 people following it.\n\nYou can use this question as a topic for an article: 10 Personal Finance Tips People with Non-Finance Background Must Know\n\nYou can further skim through the answers the question has received to identify the most common tips. Especially the most upvoted answers. It’ll help you curate ideas for the content of your article.\n\nEngaging with these questions reveals the interests and challenges of your audience, as well as specific in-demand topics. The insight allows you to tailor your content to answer these questions directly.\n\n22. Review Blog Comments\n\nBlog comments are a direct source of feedback and ideas from your audience. \n\nRegularly review the comments on your blog posts. But also check out what people are saying on your competitors’ blogs. \n\nThis can reveal what readers enjoyed, what they want to know more about, and what they felt was missing. \n\nFor instance, if you’re in a culinary niche, you can look at websites like Minimalist Baker and go through the comment section of their blog posts. Here’s an example of their post and a comment it received:\n\nBased on this comment, you can create articles and social media posts on “maple syrup baking alternatives.”\n\nYou can use these comments as direct inspiration for your content. This approach provides you with targeted content ideas. \n\nAnd if you’re addressing your own audience’s comments, it also demonstrates to your readers that their questions are considered and input is valued. Such responsiveness can build stronger connections with your audience and make your content more relatable.\n\n23. Extract Insights from Conference Discussions and Q&As\n\nAttending industry conferences, whether physically or online, is a fantastic way to gather fresh content ideas. These events include panel discussions, keynote addresses, fireside chats, and interactive Q&A sessions.\n\nThey offer a window into your field’s latest trends, concerns, and innovations.\n\nPay attention not just to the presentations but also to the questions raised by participants.\n\nFor instance, AFROTECH Conference 2023 featured several leaders and business owners discussing a range of tech-related topics, including the more inclusive future of AI.\n\nThese exchanges often highlight what professionals in the field are currently focusing on and what your audience might find intriguing. You could use this input to create content for your website and social media.\n\n24. Turn Customer Reviews into Topics\n\nPositive and negative customer reviews are an excellent source for content ideas, reflecting the direct voice of your audience. They highlight what customers appreciate and what they feel could be improved. \n\nHere’s an example of a customer review a cloud phone system has on G2:\n\nBased on this review, the brand can create content around its customer service and contract renewal. The content can reinforce that they have excellent customer support and transparent contract renewal.\n\nThe goal would be to address the concerns potential customers may have if they come across this negative review.\n\nEven positive reviews can help you come up with content creation ideas. Like this one for the same cloud phone system:\n\nThe brand can create content around ease of use and user-friendliness—how important it is to choose a phone system that’s easy to use, how to evaluate a system for its user-friendliness, and more.\n\nYou can take cues from customer reviews to create highly relevant content on topics people prioritize in decision-making and usage.\n\n25. Challenge Industry Myths and Misconceptions\n\nDebunking myths and misconceptions in your industry can make for compelling content. This involves identifying common misunderstandings or outdated beliefs in your field and clarifying them through well-researched content. \n\nIf you’re in the field of nutrition, for example, you might tackle myths like “Carbs are always bad for you” with articles backed by scientific evidence and expert opinions. \n\nCreating content that dispels these myths educates your audience and positions you as a knowledgeable and trustworthy source in your niche.\n\n26. Brainstorm Ideas with Your Marketing Team\n\nBrainstorming with your marketing team can generate various creative content ideas. Each member brings unique background, experiences, and insights, resulting in a diverse range of ideas.\n\nIn these sessions, encourage openness and value every suggestion, no matter how unconventional. \n\nFor instance, a team member with a background in graphic design might suggest visually driven content, while someone with experience in social media marketing could propose topics that address frequent customer inquiries. \n\nThis variety leads to diverse content themes, from in-depth “how-to” guides to visually engaging infographics. \n\nThe beauty of team brainstorming is its ability to blend different viewpoints and areas of expertise, culminating in content that is not only varied and interesting but also deeply reflective of your team’s collective knowledge and creativity.\n\n27. Consult Customer-Facing Employees\n\nSales teams and customer support staff directly interact with your customers and understand their questions and concerns. They are a valuable resource for content ideas. \n\nRegularly checking in with customer-facing employees can provide you with practical content ideas that address real customer issues. \n\nFor instance, if your sales team frequently gets questions about product compatibility, you could create a detailed guide or FAQ section on your website addressing these queries. \n\nThis strategy ensures your content enhances customer experience by preemptively answering common questions.\n\n28. Ask Your Audience What They Want to Hear\n\nDirectly asking your target audience about their content preferences can lead to highly tailored and engaging material. \n\nUse your social media channels, email newsletters, or even a simple survey on your website to gather their opinions. \n\nFor example, here’s Ali Abdaal, one of the world’s leading productivity experts, asking his community on YouTube what they would like to hear:\n\nEngaging your audience this way provides you with targeted content ideas. It also makes your audience feel valued and like they’re part of your content creation process.\n\nTurn Content Ideas Into Valuable Assets\n\nThere are hundreds of ways to come up with new content ideas. But not all of them will be meaningful to your audience.\n\nSo, while brainstorming topics and building your content calendar, focus on delivering value to your audience.\n\nSemrush’s Topic Research offers highly relevant topics and sub-topics that align with your niche.
