  "content": "The importance of content in SEO comes from one key fact: you can’t be visible to search engines—or your audience—without it.\n\nContent signals to search engines like Google that you’re worth recommending, allows you to get in front of your target audience, and offers you tremendous opportunities to grow your business.\n\nWhat Is Content?\n\nContent informs, educates, delights or entertains an audience with a specific goal. It’s served at a contextually relevant time—like when someone asks Google a specific question.\n\nContent comes in many forms, including website pages, video, social media posts, blog posts, whitepapers, infographics, images, and emails. You can distribute content across many channels, from your own website to social media, and a few other locations in between. \n\nMarketing teams typically create content as part of a content marketing strategy. Their goal is to attract website visitors who eventually become customers.\n\nWhat Is Content Within the Scope of SEO?\n\nContent is created first and foremost for people. Secondarily, it's created for search engines.\n\nIt’s critical for ranking in organic search results. But even Google lists creating helpful, reliable, people-first content as a fundamental principle of SEO.\n\nWhy is SEO Content Important? \n\nContent that isn't optimized for search is less likely to be found—and there’s a lot to be lost. \n\nThe importance of quality content in SEO can’t be overstated. People perform an average of 40,000 searches on Google every second, many of whom could be your potential customers. \n\nIt’s worth optimizing your content to rank organically in search engine results pages (SERPs). The average click-through rate (CTR) on the first organic result is almost 40%. On an ad, it’s only about 2%.\n\nBut SEO content is important for many more reasons than just ranking in the SERPs.\n\nTarget Relevant Topics for Your Business\n\nYour business will be an obvious fit for some search topics. Maybe you’re an art supply brand that sells paint brushes and acrylic paint. Your content is a great fit for a search query like “best painting supplies.”\n\nThat’s just the tip of the iceberg, though. \n\nYou can also reach an audience searching for other relevant topics like “best gifts for artists,” or “relaxing activities,” depending on what you sell—and how you sell it.\n\nReach Your Target Market\n\nIn November 2023, Google saw roughly 9.2 billion unique visitors worldwide.\n\nAnd Google is responsible for roughly 92.6% of all search engine traffic referrals.\n\nImage Source: DataReportal\n\nThere’s a good chance your target market is a part of those groups. \n\nBy creating high-quality, optimized content, you improve your chances of landing on the first page of Google. That makes it even more likely that you'll reach your target audience, and they'll click through to your site. And hopefully become customers.\n\nImprove Your Online Visibility\n\nGoogle and YouTube are the most visited websites on the internet. Not only are they at the top of the list—they’re visited up to 752% more than the third most-visited website, Reddit.\n\nThe number of people they attract makes them two of the best vehicles to increase your site's visibility. They determine whether or not a page is visible using a web crawler, a bot that automatically reads and understands a webpage.\n\nContent allows web crawlers to understand what your page is about. If you create well-optimized content, the bots will tell sites like Google and YouTube to share it in their search results.\n\nNurture Your Target Audience\n\nPeople come back to search engines throughout their buyer's journey. Content allows you to nurture them as they get closer to making a purchase. \n\nLet’s use our art supply company as an example. Your content could show up for a potential customer as they move through the following journey:\n\nStage 1: Search “relaxing activities” to find new ways to unwind after work, and read a blog post linking to a scientific study about how painting promotes relaxation\nStage 2: Search “best beginner paint kits” to find easy ways to get started. They watch a YouTube video reviewing affordable kits that include brushes and different paints—but don’t buy anything yet.\nStage 3: Come back a couple of days later and search for “painting kits on sale” and make a purchase from one of the landing pages that shows up in the search results\n\nOne company could show up for this person at each stage using these three different pieces of content. This is where search intent comes in.\n\nWhen you create content with SEO in mind, your goal is to give people the information they intended to find when they performed their search. If you’re successful, and they click to read or watch your content, you reach your target audience.\n\nIf the company optimized each content piece for those search queries, they could nurture their target audience throughout the entire customer journey.\n\nGrow Your Backlink Profile\n\nBacklinks are an essential part of online visibility. They signal to search engines that others found your site important enough to reference.\n\nContent is an excellent tool for creating linkworthy web pages. That often means creating something original people want to share, like original research, interactive content, thought leadership, or in-depth guides.\n\nBoost Your Crawl Frequency\n\nYour crawl frequency is how often a search engine bot crawls your website to find new information and decide what to index.\n\nThe more content you publish, the more likely Google will frequently crawl it. A higher crawl frequency may help newly published content show up in SERPs faster. Short pages with more inbound links are more likely to get crawled frequently than those with a higher page depth and fewer inbound links.\n\nThis is one example of how the benefits of content in SEO compound. The more content you publish that ranks well, the more likely your newer content will be able to rank quickly.\n\nImprove the User Experience\n\nSearch engines prioritize websites that are easy to understand and navigate. They also prioritize web pages that deliver a good user experience, which means they load quickly, are mobile-friendly, and follow best practices for usability, accessibility, and more.\n\nOne way to measure your user experience is bounce rate. A bounce rate measures the percentage of visitors who enter your site, then leave without viewing other pages. A low bounce rate could indicate that your pages are loading quickly, positively impacting your user experience.\n\nYour efforts to build content for search engine optimization will be more likely to pay off if you also provide a good user experience. Your website will show up for relevant search queries, and your site will give users the information they need quickly and painlessly.\n\nPrepare for AI’s Impact on Future SEO\n\nThe full impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on SEO isn’t clear yet. One way to prepare for AI's effect on the future of SEO is to create content that answers questions.\n\nAnswer engine optimization (AEO) content will answer your target audience’s questions in both search engines and AI tools. A good place to start is by analyzing the People Also Ask and featured snippets section of SERPs.\n\nMany marketers are betting content will make a difference here. In 2024, 31% of business-to-business (B2B) marketers will be sharpening their focus on user intent or answering questions with content.\n\nEarn a Higher CTR\n\nMultiple studies have found that a higher CTR on a SERP will probably increase your ranking. Experts like Larry Kim and Rand Fishkin believe that if your website doesn’t rank at the top of a SERP, but sees a higher CTR than what’s expected for its position, Google will likely increase its rank.\n\nA high CTR also means more targeted consumers will visit your website, potentially affecting other key business metrics like website conversions, website traffic, and bounce rate.\n\nIncrease Your Revenue from Search\n\nThe greatest benefit of content for SEO is to increase your revenue from search. \n\nCreating and publishing valuable content increases your chances of turning a website visitor into a customer.\n\nHow to Create Optimized Content\n\nDon't underestimate the importance of optimizing your content—whether written or visual—for SEO—it can make or break any page on your site.\n\nThe most important rule to follow when creating optimized content is to focus on people first, not search algorithms. It may sound counterintuitive, but you’re more likely to rank for a topic if you focus on providing value to people.\n\nUnderstand Your Target Audience\n\nYou should know what your target audience wants before you start creating content. Collect ideas from places like:\n\nBlog comments on relevant websites\nYour sales team’s recorded calls\nForums and Q&A sites like Reddit or Quora\nAmazon or Google reviews\nEmail responses to your newsletter\nSubscriber or customer surveys\nSubscriber or customer interviews\nPeople Also Ask section on Google's SERPs\n\nYou can also use our data-powered on-page SEO tool, the On Page SEO Checker, to collect fresh ideas for your content.\n\nThe tool uses data from Semrush, Google, and your website to provide actionable steps to improve your search engine rankings compared to your competitors. \n\nStrategy ideas: Get fresh SEO strategies regularly in your inbox\nBacklink ideas: Pinpoint sites to target for inbound links\nTechnical SEO ideas: Improve the way your site is built and optimized\nSemantic ideas: Ensure your content is enriched with the right keywords\nContent ideas: Determine what relevant content to create and why\nUser experience ideas: Learn how your audience perceives your website\nSERP features ideas: Learn how to earn Google SERP features\nPerform Keyword Research & Determine Your Topic\n\nNext, conduct keyword research based on the information you gleaned from your target audience discovery. Use a combination of Google search and a research tool like Semrush.\n\nOur Keyword Magic Tool is a quick way to find new ranking opportunities using a database of over 25 billion keywords. \n\nIn the left-hand menu of your main Semrush dashboard, select “SEO” > “KEYWORD RESEARCH” > “Keyword Magic Tool.” Choose a topic (or a seed keyword) you suspect might interest your audience, and type it into the search bar.\n\nClick “Search.” \n\nSelect keywords based on relevance to the user. To do that, let’s select a category to differentiate from auto or house painting. In this case, we’ll select “art.” \n\nThe keyword list will update.\n\nNow you can select keywords to add to a list.\n\nClick the checkbox to the left of keywords you want to target.\n\nWhen you’re happy with your selection, click the “Add to keyword list” button. If you haven't already created a list, click \"Create new empty list.\"\n\nName your new list and click the “checkmark” icon. \n\nYour keywords will appear in Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder, where you can auto-generate keyword clusters to inform your content.\n\nDon’t be overwhelmed by the volume of possibilities—tackle one audience targeting task at a time. Ideally, help them solve their most pressing issues first.\n\nDevelop Effective Briefs\n\nA content brief is a document that guides the content creation process. It provides a standard outline and rules to ensure the content is well optimized. \n\nDetailed briefs help content creators craft high-quality content quickly and efficiently. \n\nAn effective brief should include the following:\n\nTarget keyword\nSecondary keywords\nDirections on how to use images, video, or visuals\nDirections on how to make your piece unique\nExamples of titles and meta descriptions\nA short bulleted list of main points\nA suggested outline\nLinks to rival content\nA suggested target length\n\nYou can automatically create a brief for your next piece of content using Semrush’s SEO content template.\n\nIn the left-hand menu of your main Semrush dashboard, select “SEO” > “ON PAGE & TECH SEO” > “SEO Content Template.” \n\nSearch for your target keyword(s). Click “Create content template.”\n\nSemrush will generate a custom brief that includes everything you need to start writing or producing.\n\nAvoid using too many keywords in one piece of content. If your content gets too complex, it’ll confuse both Google and users.\n\nFor example, it might make sense to target “best painting supplies” and “best paint brushes” in one article, but don’t bundle topics like “best painting supplies” and “painting best practices.”\n\nStick to Your Topic & Target Keywords\n\nIt can be tempting to widen your piece's scope as you write. \n\nSay you’re writing a piece to rank for “best painting tools.” You might think, “Well, a new artist might not know how to use all these painting tools. I’ll also explain how to use them as I go.”\n\nThat’s an example of a keyword scope getting wider than it needs to be. Not only is this a waste of time, but it’ll prevent you from creating useful and relevant content for your target audience. \n\nSemrush’s SEO Content Template also includes writing tools like the SEO Writing Assistant (SWA). When viewing your latest SEO content template, select \"Real-time Content Check\" at the top of the page to open the assistant. \n\nDraft or paste the article copy into the tool to get an instant analysis of how likely your piece will rank for your target keyword or keyword list.\n\nContentShake AI is another all-in-one tool that uses AI to create and optimize content for SEO purposes. Use it to get content ideas, write articles more quickly, optimize copy for a target keyword, and publish directly to your site (if you're on WordPress).\n\nLocate the tool on the left-hand menu of your main dashboard by navigating to \"Content Marketing\" > \"ContentShake AI.\"\n\nThe tool will ask what type of business you own or work in, and then ask follow-up questions about your role and content budget. Answer the questions as thoroughly and accurately as possible because the tool will customize itself to your responses.\n\nOnce you've responded to all the questions, you'll arrive at the home page, where you can draft a social media post. You can also use the automatically generated ideas to create content. Or you can start with your own idea.\n\nIf you have a WordPress website, you can install the ContentShake plugin. This will allow you to publish content you create with the tool directly to your site.\n\nClick \"Learn how to connect\" to go to an installation and connection tutorial, or simply install the plugin.\n\nCreate Optimized Content\n\nwith ContentShake AI\n\nTry for Free →\nBuild Relevance via Internal Linking\n\nInternal links point to pages within the same website. Link two to three other pages on your website in every content piece you create. Just make sure the pages you link to are relevant to the page you're linking from.\n\nInternal links help search engines understand your site’s structure. A well-organized website is easier for the bot to crawl.\n\nInternal links also pass authority to other pages on your site. For example, say your article on “best painting supplies” has high authority. If it links to your new piece on “best paint brushes,” that link will signal to Google that they should consider the new page high authority, too.\n\nFinally, internal links help users navigate your site, creating a good user experience.\n\nBuild Backlinks to Your Content\n\nOutbound links point to pages on a different domain. They help search engines understand your site compared to others to determine your niche or expertise.\n\nUse outbound links in your content to point to other authoritative sites. But ensure the content is contextually relevant and adds value for your reader. Statistics, research, and videos are often great additions.\n\nIt’s also beneficial to have other sites link to you. Pages with many inbound links tend to rank higher in search results, as long as those links come from high-quality, authoritative sites.\n\nFind out how many inbound links your site has with Backlink Analytics. Locate the tool on the left-hand menu of your main dashboard by navigating to “SEO” > “LINK BUILDING” > “Backlink Analytics.” \n\nEnter your domain. Click “Analyze.” \n\nYou’ll see an overview of the number of sites linking to your website and their effect on key metrics like monthly visits and traffic.\n\nStart Creating Great Content\n\nThe importance of content in SEO isn't going to diminish any time soon.\n\nStart creating high-quality SEO content to help your business grow.
