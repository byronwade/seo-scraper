  "content": "What Is a URL Slug?\n\nA URL slug is the last part of a URL address that serves as a unique identifier of the page.\n\nFor example, the article you‚Äôre reading now has a URL that looks like this:\n\nhttps://semrush.com/blog/what-is-a-url-slug/\n\nIts URL slug is ‚Äúwhat-is-a-url-slug.‚Äù\n\nWhy Is a URL Slug Important for SEO?\n\nA URL slug is often considered a great place to include the target (or primary) keyword for a page.\n\nGoogle‚Äôs John Mueller has confirmed that words in a URL are a ranking factor.¬†\n\nBut he also emphasized that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúvery very lightweight‚Äù one, and it primarily helps to assess the page before Google accesses it.\n\nIn one of his tweets, Mueller said:\n\nIn other words:\n\nEven if having keywords in the URL is a ranking factor, we shouldn‚Äôt overestimate its effect on rankings.\n\nHowever, it might still make sense to use the target keyword of a page in a URL slug. Especially considering the user experience (UX) point of view, which is closely connected to SEO.\n\nLet's take a look at these two examples:\n\nhttps://website.com/blog/rock-climbing\nhttps://website.com/blog/82354\n\nWhile the first example provides clear information about the content of the post, the second is just a chain of numbers that doesn't provide any added value.¬†\n\nIf someone only saw these two URL addresses, they'd be more likely to click the first one. Regardless of the actual content on either page.\n\nThat's why a URL slug should provide a concise description of a page.\n\nURL Slug Best Practices\n\nLet's take a look at some best practices and tips on how to create good URL slugs.\n\nBe Descriptive\n\nAs we've already mentioned, the primary role of URL slugs is to make URLs more user-friendly. Therefore, they should describe the content of a page.\n\nGood URL slug: /best-air-purifier\nBad URL slug: /2575\n\nUsing the target keyword is a great way to achieve this. Why? Because it‚Äôs usually an accurate, yet very short, description of what the page is about.¬†\n\nMake It Concise and Easy to Read\n\nA good URL slug shouldn't be too long. Long URLs are harder to read and remember. Try to use fewer than five words in your slug.¬†\n\nGood URL slug: /abs-exercises\nBad URL slug: /the-best-abs-exercises-for-all-levels-of-gym-goer\n\nAlso, a URL that‚Äôs too long will get truncated in Google‚Äôs search results. While this is not an SEO disaster, it doesn't make the page snippet look very good.\n\nInclude Your Target Keyword\n\nIncluding your target keyword in the URL slug will make it easier for both search engines and users to understand that your page is relevant to a particular search query.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of a good and bad URL slug for a page targeting the keyword ‚Äúkeyword research.‚Äù\n\nGood URL slug: /keyword-research\nBad URL slug: /10-tips-for-researching-keywords\nSeparate Words\n\nHow you separate the words (or not) influences the readability of a URL slug. Separating the words in the slug helps users understand the URL more easily.¬†\n\nGood URL slug: /best-travel-tips\nBad URL slug: /besttraveltips\nUse Hyphens, Not Underscores\n\nThe best practice is to use hyphens to separate words in URLs. Search engines may not correctly interpret other separators (like underscores).¬†\n\nGood URL slug: /good-old-fashioned-pancakes\nBad URL slug: /good_old_fashioned_pancakes\nUse Lowercase Characters\n\nSince URLs are case-sensitive, it‚Äôs best to stick to lowercase characters to avoid mistyped URLs.\n\nLowercase URLs are also easier to type manually.¬†\n\nGood URL slug: /new-york\nBad URL slug: /New-York\nAvoid Special Characters\n\nGoogle Search Central recommends avoiding non-ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) characters, such as special characters of some languages or emojis.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example for a hypothetical page in German:\n\nGood URL slug: /kaiserstrasse\nBad URL slug: /kaiserstra√üe\n\nAnd one using emojis:\n\nGood URL slug: /emoji-meanings\nBad URL slug: /üòäüöÄ\nMake It Future-Proof\n\nIt‚Äôs best to avoid numbers in URLs that are likely to be changed in the future, like a number of tips or ideas or the publishing year.\n\nGood URL slug: /how-to-write-url-slugs\nBad URL slug: /10-tips-to-write-url-slugs-in-2022\n\nNote\n\nIf you have to change an existing URL slug, remember to redirect the old URL to the new one.\n\nURL Slugs in WordPress\n\nLet's take a closer look at how to change a URL slug in WordPress.¬†\n\nFirst and foremost, you need to make sure your permalink structure will allow for user-friendly URL slugs.\n\nGo to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù and click ‚ÄúPermalinks.‚Äù\n\nHere, you'll be able to select one of the basic permalink structure types or create a custom one. We recommend using the ‚ÄúPost name‚Äù structure.\n\nThis way, WordPress will automatically create URL slugs based on the title of your page or post. But more importantly, it will allow you to edit the URL slug.\n\nTo change a URL slug in WordPress, go to the editor of a specific post or page.\n\nHere, in the right panel, you'll find the ‚ÄúLink‚Äù section. After clicking the automatically generated slug, you'll be able to edit it.\n\nIf you're using the Yoast SEO plugin, you can change the URL slug in the Yoast SEO panel at the bottom of the post editor.¬†\n\nThe plugin's ‚ÄúSEO analysis‚Äù section will also notify you if your URL slug does not contain your focus keyphrase (i.e., the target keyword).\n\nTake this as a recommendation you can follow if it makes sense for you‚Äînot something you need to do at all costs.\n\nAs we've established earlier, keywords in URL slugs have a very small SEO impact. You should primarily focus on the user experience rather than keyword stuffing.¬†\n\nNote\n\nMost other content management systems allow you to customize URL slugs. Here's how to do that in Wix, Shopify, BigCommerce, and Squarespace.\n\nCheck Your Website for URL Issues\n\nYou can use Semrush‚Äôs Site Audit tool to check your website for a number of URL issues that might be preventing you from getting higher rankings in search engine results.\n\nHere‚Äôs how:\n\nEnter your domain and click the ‚ÄúStart Audit‚Äù button.\n\nSite Audit lets you customize a number of settings for the audit. In most cases, you can simply stick to the default settings and click ‚ÄúStart Site Audit‚Äù to start the audit.\n\nThe tool will then analyze your website for a variety of technical SEO issues. And present you with a detailed report outlining all the issues.\n\nFrom here, navigate to the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab and type ‚ÄúURL‚Äù in the search bar.\n\nYou‚Äôll then see a list of all URL-related issues the tool uncovered on your website.\n\nA few common issues you might encounter include:\n\nIncorrect URL format: Using special characters or spaces which search engine crawlers can‚Äôt process\nURLs with too many parameters: Using too many URL parameters (e.g., /?color=black) makes URLs less enticing for users to click and can lead to duplicate content issues\nURLs that are too long: URLs with over 200 characters can appear truncated in Google‚Äôs search results, making users less inclined to visit them\n\nYou can then click on the linked part of each issue to see a list of pages affected by it. Or click on ‚ÄúWhy and how to fix it‚Äù to find out more about the issue and how to address it.\n\nOptimize Your URL Slugs\n\nURL slugs are a small but important part of optimizing a page for search engines. Follow the tips outlined above to make sure your URL slugs are SEO-friendly.\n\nAnd use Semrush‚Äôs Site Audit tool to check your website for URL-related issues.\n\nFAQs About URL Slugs\nDoes the URL Slug Affect SEO?\n\nYes. As confirmed by Google‚Äôs John Mueller, URL slugs are a lightweight ranking factor.\n\nGoogle‚Äôs crawler looks at a website slug to get a better understanding of what the page is about before crawling it.\n\nAre Website Slugs Important for SEO?\n\nYes, URL slugs are important for SEO. They are an important user experience element. And UX and SEO are closely connected.\n\nHowever, words used in URLs are a very lightweight ranking factor.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between a URL Slug and a URL?\n\nThe URL is the entire web address of a page, while the URL slug is just the last part of the URL that serves as an identifier of the page.\n\nURL: https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone-12\nURLslug: /iphone-12\nWhat Happens When You Change the URL Slug?\n\nOnce the URL slug is changed, the whole URL address of a page is changed. It means the page can't be accessed through the old URL address anymore.¬†\n\nEvery time you change the URL slug, it is best practice to set up a 301 redirect from the old URL to the new one.¬†\n\nThis way, you'll prevent users from landing on a 404 error page. As well as a potential loss of traffic and link equity from links pointing to the old URL.\n\nWhy Is It Called a Slug?\n\nThe name ‚Äúslug‚Äù has been used in journalism. It refers to the practice of using short descriptions of articles for internal purposes.\n\nWeb developers supposedly picked up on this terminology and started using it to refer to the descriptive part of the URL.",
