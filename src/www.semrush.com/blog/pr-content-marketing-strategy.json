  "content": "PR and content marketing both aim to strengthen a brand's visibility and reputation to support business growth. But in different ways.\n\nThey're two distinct marketing disciplines with unique tactics and metrics. \n\nIn this article, we’ll cover exactly what PR and content marketing are, the activities they include, and how to measure success.\n\nLet’s start.\n\nContent Marketing vs. PR: The Basics \nContent Marketing Overview\n\nContent marketing is a type of digital marketing that includes creating and sharing content to attract and engage a target audience. \n\nThis content isn’t as explicitly promotional as PR content. It provides high-quality information to meet the audience’s needs by answering their questions, helping them learn something new, and/or entertaining them. \n\nOver time, this positions you as a trusted source. And can lead to business growth.\n\nBecause speaking to a specific audience is central to content marketing, it’s a good idea to use Semrush's One2Target to gain information about the people you want to reach.\n\nOpen the tool, add up to five competitors’ domains, and click \"Analyze.\"\n\nYou'll see four reports:\n\nDemographics: Shows your audience’s age, gender, and location\nSocioeconomics: Shows your audience’s employment status, education level, household size, and income level\nBehavior: Shows your audience’s interests, device preferences, and social media use\nAudience Overlap: Shows how audiences overlap across competitors and which domains they visit\n\nThe insights you gain here can inform the content types you focus on and how you distribute it.\n\nFor example, if data shows your audience is primarily active on Instagram, focus on creating engaging Instagram posts and stories. \n\nStreamline Audience Research\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\nPR Overview\n\nPR focuses on managing your company's public image. To get people to know, develop an affinity for, and trust your brand. \n\nYou do this by crafting stories and messages that positively influence how people view your business. Which can be focused on your products, services, overall brand, or even people within your company.\n\nAnd PR typically involves engaging with journalists, organizing events, and handling crisis communications to ensure the company is seen favorably.\n\nLike with content marketing, these efforts can lead to business growth over time.\n\nContent Marketing vs. PR: Main Goals\nContent Marketing Goals\n\nHere are some of the main goals content marketing focuses on:\n\nBoost Brand Awareness\n\nYou can enhance your brand’s visibility by consistently sharing high-quality content on different channels.\n\nFor example, sharing an insightful infographic on social media can increase brand awareness as your followers share it with their own networks. \n\nAt Semrush, we do this often. Here’s an example from LinkedIn:\n\nPublishing SEO-friendly content on your website is also valuable for increasing visibility. Because it can appear in search results and attract more organic (unpaid) traffic.\n\nFor example, here's a Shopify blog post that drew 201,300 organic visits in January 2024.\n\nGenerate Leads\n\nSparking audience interest through engaging content can translate to lead generation and potential sales. \n\nHow?\n\nUsers are willing to share their information (often by filling out a form) in exchange for a well-crafted guide or informative webinar. And they’re more likely to do so if they’ve regularly seen great content from you in the past.\n\nHere’s an example of a downloadable guide that HubSpot uses to collect users’ email addresses and other details:\n\nDepending on where users are in the buying journey, how familiar they are with your brand, and the type of content they’re viewing, they could even make a purchase.\n\nEstablish Authority\n\nSharing expert-created content helps position your brand as an authority in your field. Which builds credibility with your audience and can even improve your SEO performance.\n\nFor instance, publishing in-depth research reports establishes your brand as a reliable and trusted source of information among your audience. And aligns with Google’s recommendations on producing quality content that’s useful, reliable, and focused on people.\n\nWe regularly publish original research like this:\n\nPR Goals\n\nNow, let’s take a look at what you can achieve with effective PR:\n\nBuild Brand Awareness\n\nMany PR activities are designed to attract attention from media outlets that can share news about your brand. Giving you more reach than you could achieve through your own channels.\n\nFor example, you could pitch a report on a survey you conducted to publications that might be interested. If one or more uses it as the basis for a story, it can be seen by audiences who might otherwise not have known about you.\n\nProtect Brand Reputation\n\nPR aims to create a favorable image for your company by highlighting successes and managing negative publicity. \n\nFor example, PR efforts can focus on promoting achievements like awards through various media channels. Like how RingCentral does it here:\n\nAnd when something negative occurs (like a product recall), PR can mitigate any reputation damage.\n\nThis involves transparent communication with the public and stakeholders. And taking active steps to resolve the issue and restore the brand's image.\n\nContent Marketing vs. PR: Typical Activities\nContent Marketing Activities\n\nContent marketing leverages different types of content and channels to achieve defined goals. Here are some of the most common:\n\nBlog Posts\n\nBlog posts help educate and engage your audience by answering their specific questions and addressing their pain points. \n\nThey also help with SEO—as long as it’s truly high-quality content.\n\nUse Semrush's AI-powered SEO Writing Assistant to ensure your content aligns with what readers and search engines want to see.\n\nType, import, or generate content in the editor. \n\nThen, enter at least two keywords, choose your target audience, and click \"Get recommendations.\"\n\nThe tool will analyze your text. And give you a score based on SEO, readability, originality, and tone of voice.\n\nClick on the “SEO” button to see more information about how your content is doing from an SEO perspective.\n\nThe tool provides recommendations about things like the number of links to include, how frequently to use your target keyword, and additional keywords you should include in the content.\n\nYou can use these insights to publish search engine-friendly blog posts.\n\nReview Your Drafts in Real Time\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign up Now →\nVideos\n\nVideos can communicate complex topics in an easily digestible, engaging format.\n\nIn fact, 92% of global internet users watched online video content in Q3 2023, according to Statista.\n\nThis is why many brands now have their own YouTube channels where they talk about their products/services, industry, and related topics. \n\nLike ConvertKit:\n\nEmail Campaigns\n\nEmails let you reach your audience directly in their inboxes. Making them a highly personalized way to communicate.\n\nYou can provide updates and exclusive content to keep your audience engaged.\n\nHere's an example of an email update from newsletter platform Beehiiv:\n\nFurther reading: How to Win People Over with Compelling Email Content\n\nGuest Blogging\n\nGuest blogging on relevant websites gets your brand name in front of a wider audience. And helps further build your industry authority. \n\nIt can also lead to backlinks (links from other sites that point to your site). Which are a key ranking factor.\n\nEven if you aren’t able to secure a backlink (not all sites include them for guest posts), guest posting is a good way to introduce your brand to a new audience.\n\nHere's an example of a guest post on Adweek from our own Marcus Tober:\n\nSocial Media\n\nSocial media platforms allow for more engagement with your audience. Which helps you develop relationships.\n\nWhether you choose detailed posts on LinkedIn, quick updates on X (previously known as Twitter), or something else will depend on which platform(s) your audience prefers.\n\nNo matter the platform, it’s best to include a variety of post types to keep your content fresh and engaging. \n\nFor example, Mailchimp posts a mix of promotional and educational content across platforms like Instagram.\n\nWebinars\n\nWebinars are live or pre-recorded virtual events that can be used for in-depth discussions with experts, product demonstrations, and Q&As.\n\nThey’re often used as a type of gated content. Which can support lead generation.\n\nFor example, Blinkist holds live webinars that interested users need to sign up to attend:\n\nPR Activities\n\nPR also uses various tactics to achieve its goals. Here are some of the most common activities an effective PR strategy uses:\n\nPress Releases\n\nPress releases are used to announce events, product launches, or company achievements with the media. To encourage press coverage that boosts brand awareness.\n\nHere’s a template showing what they often look like:\n\nTo give press releases as much visibility as possible, it’s usually best to publish them to your website and also distribute them via newswire services.\n\nMedia Outreach\n\nContacting members of the press directly to share press releases, provide early access to a report, or set up exclusive interviews increases the odds of securing coverage for your company.\n\nWhen you see articles with a company CEO like this one featuring Siemens CEO Roland Busch, it’s usually the result of media outreach. \n\nSponsorships\n\nSponsorships let you publicly align your brand with causes your target audience cares about. Which can enhance brand visibility and help people connect with your company on a deeper level. \n\nFor instance, enterprise software company SAP has several sponsorship programs. Including for athletes.\n\nThe key to sponsorships is to ensure that you’re supporting individuals and organizations that are relevant to you.\n\nPublic Speaking\n\nPublic speaking events (e.g., industry conferences or panel discussions) offer an opportunity to share your expertise, insights, and brand messages directly with an engaged audience.\n\nFor example, NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang gave a keynote address at a leadership conference in California’s Bay Area:\n\nIndustry Events\n\nTaking part in relevant exhibitions, trade shows, and other events is a straightforward way to build brand awareness.\n\nThese PR activities provide opportunities for face-to-face interaction. Where you can answer questions and build relationships with potential partners, investors, and customers.\n\nCommunity Initiatives\n\nPartaking in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities helps build a positive brand image. Which can enhance trust and loyalty with your audience.\n\nThis might involve participating in environmental projects or charity events. Which can resonate strongly with your audience by showing a shared dedication to positive change.\n\nBrands like Oracle have comprehensive CSR policies and run initiatives in countries all around the world:\n\nContent Marketing vs. PR: Metrics to Measure Success\nContent Marketing Metrics\n\nMeasuring content marketing efforts allows you to figure out if you should keep doing what you’re doing. Or if you need to switch things up. \n\nThis ensures your content marketing efforts support your business goals.\n\nHere are a few content marketing metrics you can track to measure success:\n\nOrganic traffic: The number of visits that come to your site from organic search results\nAverage engagement rate: The portion of people who interact with your social content relative to the number of followers you have\nConversion rate: The rate of visitors who take a desired action (like making a purchase) our of all your visitors\nLeads generated: The number of leads generated through content marketing efforts\nKeyword rankings: The positions (how high up in search results) your content has in search results\nBacklinks: The number of links from other sites that direct to your site as a result of content marketing efforts\n\nUse Semrush's Backlink Analytics to quickly evaluate your backlink profile. \n\nJust go to the “Referring Domains” tab to find out which media outlets are linking your domain.\n\nPay particular attention to any that are labeled “Lost.” Those indicate domains that used to link to you but no longer do.\n\nConsider creating link-worthy content and reaching out to those domains. To reclaim those lost backlinks and boost your SEO performance. \n\nYou can find some of these other metrics in Google Analytics.\n\nPR Metrics\n\nMeasuring PR performance helps you understand whether your PR campaigns are having their intended impact.

Which shows a breakdown of your positive and negative mentions.\n\nIf you notice a high proportion of negative comments, it's a cue to investigate the issues being discussed. And consider a communication effort intended to shift public perception.\n\nIf the vast majority of mentions are positive, that’s a sign to continue your current PR activities.\n\nFind Your Brand Mentions\n\nwith the Media Monitoring App\n\nTry for Free →\nFrequently Asked Questions About PR and Content Marketing\nWhich Is Better: PR or Content Marketing?\n\nBoth disciplines support larger business goals.
