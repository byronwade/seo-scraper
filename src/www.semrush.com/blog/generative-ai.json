  "content": "What Is Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence)?\n\nGenerative AI refers to technology that uses machine learning models to create content. Machine learning models are computer programs that seek to replicate aspects of human intelligence.\n\nThese models can produce various content formats, including code, text, visuals, audio, and video.\n\nVarious programs have the ability to learn almost any kind of information. For example, different generative AI models can understand coding, visual, scientific, and human languages.\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT is a popular example of a model that understands and produces textual content. In this article, we’ll explore how this and other gen AI tools work.\n\nHow Generative AI Works\n\nGen AI uses libraries of existing material to produce original content. Here’s how the process works.\n\nFirst, Users Provide Prompts\n\nThe technology generates content based on user prompts. Depending on the tool you use, you may be able to enter freeform, text-based prompts.\n\nSuppose you want to generate a description for a new ecommerce item. A simple ChatGPT prompt could look like this:\n\nWrite a 100-word product description for [insert product details]. Use a friendly, upbeat tone of voice.\n\nSome AI tools use parameters rather than freeform input. \n\nFor example, Semrush’s Ecommerce Booster app generates ad descriptions based on keywords, text length, readability, tone of voice, and format settings.\n\nThen, Generative AI Models Produce Content\n\nOnce the system receives the user’s prompt, it uses machine learning models to generate content. These models train using libraries that may contain billions of pieces of existing content.\n\nAs they train, the models learn the components and structures of this existing content. Then, they use what they’ve learned to generate similar, original material.\n\nThe mechanics of the content generation process vary, depending on the type of output. Some of the most common models include:\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs): Algorithms that use large data sets to predict the next output (word) in a piece of content—typically used to generate textual content\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Deep learning systems that use two competing neural networks to produce new output, mostly for visual or audio content generation\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs): Neural network systems that encode and decode input to create new output, often to generate visual or code content\nGen AI vs. Other Types of AI\n\nThe standard generative AI meaning doesn’t include all types of artificial intelligence. Unlike gen AI, so-called “normal” AI analyzes and synthesizes data rather than generate new output.\n\nHere are two other types of AI:\n\nConversational AI: Uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze human language, understand what users are saying or typing, and provide relevant responses. This type of AI is most common in chatbots and AI assistants.\nPredictive AI: Analyzes historical data to anticipate outcomes from specific events and suggest actionable steps. This kind of AI is common with data analysts who need to manage risk and make data-driven decisions.\nPopular Gen AI Tools\n\nNow that we’ve covered a comprehensive generative AI definition, let’s take a closer look at some of the most widely used gen AI tools.\n\nChatGPT\n\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. It produces text responses to prompts.\n\nLike this:\n\nChatGPT can do a range of tasks like creating lists, producing code, and answering questions. It also generates outlines and creative content.\n\nHow does ChatGPT work?\n\nIt uses generative pre-trained transformer technology (an LLM) to produce human-like responses to text prompts.\n\nOpenAI also offers custom GPTs—versions of ChatGPT that perform specific tasks using personalized prompts. \n\nFor instance, you could create a custom GPT to edit written content to reflect your brand voice.\n\nFurther reading: ChatGPT for Marketing: 8 Marketing Use Cases (+ Prompts)\n\nClaude\n\nLike ChatGPT, Claude is an AI chatbot that generates text responses to prompts.\n\nClaude can also analyze the content you upload (e.g., a spreadsheet or a PDF). It then provides summaries or answers questions based on your prompts.\n\nClaude can assist with tasks like AI copywriting and content generation, too. In your prompt, you can include guidelines for the format and style of content you want to create.\n\nGemini\n\nSimilar to ChatGPT and Claude, Gemini (formerly Google Bard) is another AI chatbot that provides text responses to prompts.\n\nLike this:\n\nAs a Google app, Gemini is integrated with many Google products. Which lets you verify its responses via Google Search with one click.\n\nYou can also prompt Gemini to summarize files in Google Drive. Like a virtual assistant.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot\n\nAnother AI chatbot, Microsoft Copilot generates multimedia responses to prompts.\n\nAlong with producing a text answer, it shows you relevant images and links from Bing’s search results.\n\nDALL-E\n\nDALL-E is a text-to-image generative AI tool developed by OpenAI. It generates images based on prompts like this one:\n\nIn addition to describing the contents of the image, prompts can also request a style. The more specific and detailed your prompt, the more likely the image will meet your needs.\n\nDALL-E uses a diffusion model to analyze images and look for patterns in the components. Then, the image generation app uses what it’s learned to piece together its own AI image.\n\nNote\n\nA diffusion model adds random noise (variations) to available training data. Then, it reverses the process to recover the data and create new combinations of information.\n\nMidjourney\n\nMidjourney is a text-to-image generator that uses diffusion models and LLMs to create realistic content.\n\nLike this:\n\nCompared to DALL-E, Midjourney’s prompts are much more complex. For example, prompts must include style and dimension guidelines.\n\nUnlike many other generative AI tools, Midjourney isn’t a standalone app but a Discord bot. To use it, you’ll need to join the Midjourney Discord server and prompt the bot.\n\nFurther reading: 11 AI Content Generators to Make Great Content in Minutes\n\nWhat Can You Use Generative AI for?\n\nHere are the most common applications of generative artificial intelligence today.\n\nMarketing\n\nGenerative AI tools let you quickly brainstorm marketing campaign ideas as well as draft blog posts and articles.\n\nAI marketing software also helps with rewriting content and applying a consistent tone of voice. \n\nUse ContentShake AI to generate written and visual content in seconds. The AI-powered tool guides you through the whole process—from ideation to publication.\n\nFrom the main dashboard, click “My own idea” and enter your topic. Hit “Start writing.”\n\nReview the suggested title, target keywords, word count, tone of voice, and readability level. Click “Create article.”\n\nRead through the AI-generated article.

Then, click “Accept,” “Reject,” or “Try again.”\n\nAlternatively, open the “Smart Writer” drop-down and select “Rephraser.” Input your text and choose one of the four optimization options. Then, click “Rephrase.”\n\nReview the AI-generated ideas and click “Rephrase” to generate more. Use the copy button to choose where to paste the text, or click “Replace and close” to insert it where the cursor is positioned.\n\nUse the AI-powered Smart Writer from Semrush to elaborate on existing content. \n\nWrite at least a few sentences. Then, click “Compose” to generate more copy.\n\nSelect the “Ask AI” feature to submit custom questions or prompts. Then, click “Ask.”\n\nAs you create your content, keep an eye on the score in the upper right corner. Aim for as close to 10 as possible. This score factors in readability, tone of voice, originality, and SEO.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s AI Social Content Generator app to produce content for social media marketing. This app offers video generation and can create unlimited social media posts.\n\nAdvertising\n\nYou can take advantage of AI advertising tools to generate both copy and creatives for your paid promotions.\n\nAI Writing Assistant allows you to compose ad headlines quickly.\n\nOpen the app from the Semrush App Center and select “All Tools” > “Social Media & Ads.” \n\nThen, choose either “Facebook Headlines” or “Google Ads Headlines” to generate ad headlines. Or “Facebook Primary Text” or “Google Ads Description” for ad description text.\n\nSelect a language, creativity level, and tone of voice. Next, input your audience and product name details and write a short product description. Click “Generate.”\n\nReview the results. Save any headlines you like—or copy and paste them directly into your ad platform.\n\nTo generate complete ad creatives, open Semrush’s AdCreative.ai.\n\nEnter your domain or landing page, and click “Import Brand” to add brand elements quickly. \n\nThe app automatically identifies your brand name, logo, and colors. Review them and click the “Create Brand” button.\n\nNote\n\nIf you’ve already set up a brand, click “Create a Brand” from the “Brand Setup” section to add a new one to your dashboard.\n\nFrom the list of asset types, select “Ad Creatives.”\n\nChoose the creative format that best fits the advertising platform and hit “Next Step.”\n\nClick the “Generate Texts” button to create text with AI. Click “Next Step.”\n\nInput some information about the content you want to generate. Then, click “Save & Generate.”\n\nUpload a background image, crop it if necessary, and enter a project name (optional). You can also use the app’s image search engine to source background images. Finally, click “Generate.”\n\nCheck the box below for all the AI-generated assets you want to use and hit the “Download” button.\n\nYou can now upload the digital assets to your ad platform and set up your ad campaign.\n\nMedia\n\nFilm, animation, and gaming studios use generative AI to produce creative content more efficiently. \n\nWith advanced AI tools, they can generate realistic 3D models, avatars, and video content. \n\nFor example, large gaming studios can use gen AI to create more photorealistic characters or speed up game design workflows.\n\nCoding\n\nSoftware developers are able to code programs and applications with generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot. \n\nThe benefits include writing more consistent code in various programming languages, debugging code faster, and improving developer efficiency.\n\nHealthcare\n\nGenerative AI models serve the medical industry across a wide range of applications. \n\nFor instance, medical researchers use gen AI for genome sequencing and drug research. Health practitioners use them for medical imaging and assigning accurate medical codes.\n\nAutomotive\n\nAuto manufacturers use AI models to improve vehicle design and implement in-vehicle AI-powered virtual assistants. \n\nGenerative design inspired BMW’s “Alive Geometry” in the Vision Next 100 concept car, which enables shape-shifting parts that interact with the driver.\n\nImage Source: BMW\n\nMany manufacturers also provide basic customer service using AI before involving human agents.\n\nA 2023 Deloitte report anticipates that generative AI will lead to a 20% equipment availability increase and a 10% annual maintenance cost decrease for the automotive industry.\n\nData Synthesis\n\nIt’s impossible for generative AI models to learn or improve their processes and computations without training data. However, training data doesn’t necessarily exist for every possible industry or use case.\n\nTo resolve this issue, generative models can themselves produce synthetic data for training purposes. They also effectively address challenges and ethical concerns that may otherwise prevent industries from using generative AI.\n\nFor example, gen AI tools may create larger datasets for underrepresented groups. Or generate datasets that offer a more fair version of the original data.\n\nBenefits and Limitations of Generative AI\n\nTo set appropriate expectations for any AI-generated content you produce, you should familiarize yourself with the pros and cons of using these models.\n\nBenefits of Generative AI\nProduces almost any type of digital media based on a brief prompt\nCreates different types of content in a consistent style or format defined by the user\nGives individuals and teams of any size the capacity to create large volumes of content\nAllows users to save time and money on the content creation process\nSimplifies lengthy content or expands on short content in seconds\n\nHere’s an example prompt using ChatGPT to tighten up a very wordy explanation of the law of inertia. \n\nAs compelling as these benefits are, they don’t necessarily mean anyone should create exclusively AI-generated content. \n\nHuman feedback, fact-checking, and manual editing can always ensure higher quality and improved accuracy.\n\nFurther reading: 15 Benefits of ChatGPT (+8 Disadvantages)\n\nLimitations of Generative AI Tools\nMay reflect biases or inaccuracies present in their training content: AI tools don’t always have the ability to identify or address these elements\nMay not cite original sources or attribute concepts accurately: When the sources aren’t clear, further research may be difficult or impossible\nOffer insufficient transparency into their technology and methods: The average user may not know how a certain tool trains or generates content\nCan’t think independently or generate new ideas: Since generative AI tools train on existing data, they don’t have the capacity to create completely new content\nLack first-hand experience and personal opinions: Generative AI tools can’t think for themselves, so human review and experience can improve accuracy and add expertise\n\nHere’s what happened when we asked Notion AI to generate an opinion about the TV show Family Guy: \n\nAlthough these limitations may seem daunting, they shouldn’t prevent you from using generative AI applications for efficiency. \n\nThen, use your human intelligence to detect AI-written content bias, ethical considerations, and attribution issues. And tweak the content as necessary.\n\nFurther reading: AI-Generated Content: A Complete Guide to the Pros & Cons\n\nConcerns Surrounding Generative AI\n\nAlthough gen AI can certainly be used for good, it has the potential to create serious concerns.\n\nAs an example, deepfakes are digitally altered photos or videos that make the subject appear to be another person. One can use them maliciously to propagate false information.\n\nAlthough deepfake detectors can increasingly identify images and videos that simulate another person, foolproof methods to alleviate these concerns don’t yet exist. \n\nInstead, it’s essential to analyze content closely for anomalies. And adhere to security protocols to protect sensitive information.\n\nBecause generative models create content that emulates existing visual, audio, and textual patterns, they have the power to mislead. \n\nParticularly, their ability to mimic human language can be used for social engineering. Which the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity defines as:\n\nAll techniques aimed at talking a target into revealing specific information or performing a specific action for illegitimate reasons.\n\nFor instance, gen AI models can encourage people to disclose sensitive information. Or compromise either personal privacy or their company’s security.\n\nAnd as generative AI becomes more advanced, the infrastructure these models require may reach an unsustainable scale.\n\nKeeping up with computer demands and coming up with the capital necessary to fund it is an ongoing concern for AI model developers.\n\nA History of the Development of Generative AI\n\nGenerative AI has consistently made headlines since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 and other foundation models shortly after. However, the technology existed long before this date.\n\nWe list some major generative AI advancements in the table below.\n\nA Brief History of Generative AI\n\n\n\n\n1947\n\n\t\n\nIntelligent machinery\n\nIn one of the first recorded references to artificial intelligence, Alan Turing used the term “intelligent machinery” in a research paper. The study explored whether machines could spot rational behavior.\n\n\n\n\n1950\n\n\t\n\nTuring Test\n\nTuring developed the Turing Test, which evaluated conversations between machines and human brains to identify machine responses.\n\n\n\n\n1956\n\n\t\n\nDartmouth AI conference\n\nThe Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, considered the birth of AI, brought together AI experts.\n\n\n\n\n1961\n\n\t\n\nELIZA chatbot\n\nJoseph Weizenbaum developed the ELIZA chatbot, a psychotherapy program that could converse with humans. And one of the first examples of generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n1980s\n\n\t\n\nRNN architecture\n\nSeveral researchers advanced recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Furthering the development of this bidirectional artificial neural network.\n\n\n\n\n1997\n\n\t\n\nLSTM networks\n\nJosef Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber invented long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, significantly improving the accuracy of AI models.\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\t\n\nGANs and VAEs\n\nThe development of GANs and VAEs dramatically advanced generative AI technology.\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\t\n\nTransformer models\n\nNewly developed transformer models allowed gen AI systems to create natural language text for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\t\n\nOpenAI GPT\n\nOpenAI released GPT, a neural network that could generate human-like text and converse with users.\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\t\n\nOpenAI DALL-E\n\nOpenAI introduced DALL-E to generate digital images from prompts through deep learning.\n\n\n\n\n2022 \n\n\t\n\nOpenAI ChatGPT, Midjourney beta\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT (also known as GPT-3.5), a transformer-based model that one million users adopted in only five days. \n\nText-to-image generator Midjourney launched in beta the same year.\n\nWhat Does Generative AI Mean for the Future?\n\nWhile generative AI’s timeline is relatively long, many significant developments have happened in a few short years. \n\nGiven this rapid evolution, it’s reasonable to expect that gen AI will continue to develop quickly.\n\nSo, what will AI look like in the future? And how could it affect your industry?\n\nHere are a few developments to monitor:\n\nIncreased adoption of generative AI tools: In many industries, companies are already pressuring leaders to implement AI tools. A Qualtrics survey of customer experience professionals revealed that 75% feel the pressure to use generative AI for business.\nMore advanced AI prompts: The more companies adopt generative AI strategies, the more advanced their prompting skills are likely to become. With extensive testing, users will probably develop more specific, nuanced prompts for producing higher-quality content.\nHigher volume of AI-generated content: As more individuals and business processes use gen AI tools, the amount of AI-generated content will increase. Harvard Professor Latanya Sweeney predicts 90% of online content creation will no longer be by humans.\nImproved AI detection: As AI evolves, AI detection tools may become more sophisticated. Increasingly advanced tools will better address issues with cybersecurity, deepfakes, and other growing concerns—potentially making AI content more credible.\n\nFurther reading: 15 Must-Watch AI Trends to Empower Your Business in 2024\n\nUse Advanced AI Tools to Improve Your Content\n\nWhether you’re just getting started with generative AI or looking for ways to level up your AI skills, you need the right tools at your disposal.
