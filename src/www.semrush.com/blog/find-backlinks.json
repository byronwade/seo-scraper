  "content": "Backlinks are links from other websites pointing to your site. And getting high-quality backlinks can help you rank higher in the search results.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll show you how to analyze your own site’s backlinks. And how to analyze your competitors’ links to find new backlinking opportunities.\n\nBut before we dive into specific tactics, let’s go over what a backlink analysis involves. \n\nWhat Is a Backlink Analysis?\n\nA backlink analysis is the process of measuring the quantity and quality of your backlinks and your competitor’s backlinks.\n\nIt involves using backlink-checking tools to understand:\n\nWho’s linking to the website\nThe quality of the linking domains\nThe anchor text (the clickable text that indicates a link) used for the backlinks\nThe types of backlinks a site has (which can influence whether they pass ranking strength)\n\nThese details provide clues about a site’s backlink profile. And whether it’s healthy. \n\nFor example, a high-quality backlink profile typically features links from a variety of relevant and trusted sites. With a range of anchor texts and types of backlinks.\n\nPro tip​​​​​​\n\nQuickly find out whether your website has a healthy backlink profile with Semrush’s Backlink Audit tool. If your score is “Medium” or “High,” there’s room for improvement.\n \n\nWhy Are Backlink Analyses Important for SEO?\n\nA backlink analysis is crucial for SEO because it helps you manage your backlink profile. And a strong backlink profile can help you rank high in Google’s organic (unpaid) search results.\n\nPlus, a backlink analysis can uncover new backlink opportunities. \n\nFor example, during your analysis, you might notice a large number of your backlinks are to case studies. This likely means case studies are a valuable, link-worthy type of content in your niche. \n\nYou can leverage this insight to create more case studies.\n\nHow to Find Backlinks with Backlink-Specific Tools\n\nBelow, we’ll explore two effective methods for discovering backlink opportunities for your site.\n\nPro tip​​​​​​\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account (no credit card required) to follow along with these steps. \n\nUse Backlink Analytics\n\nSemrush’s Backlink Analytics tool gives you insight into your own backlinks. And your competitors' backlinks, too.\n\nFirst, enter your domain (or one of your competitors’) and click “Analyze.”\n\nYou’ll then see a high-level overview of that domain’s link profile. For a detailed look at the individual backlinks, go to the “Backlinks” tab.\n\nYou’ll then see insights like specific backlinks, the linking page’s Authority Score (a measure of its overall quality on a scale from 0 to 100), and the anchor text for those links. \n\nUse this report to evaluate the relevance and quality of links pointing to a site.\n\nBecause not all links are equal. And you need to consider link quality, not just link quantity. \n\nFor example, imagine you’re in the health and fitness niche. \n\nHaving a few links from authoritative and relevant sites like WebMD, Healthline, and Men’s Health would usually be more valuable than having lots of links from random, unrelated sites.\n\nYou can also filter and sort the links by various criteria, such as Authority Score, the current status of the link (active, new, and lost), the time period when the links were acquired, and the link type.\n\nTo show only active links that pass authority, click the “Active” and “Follow” tabs at the top of the table.\n\nBacklink Analytics also lets you see which pages on a website have the most backlinks. And which sites point to each page.\n\nJust go to the “Indexed Pages” tab. And you’ll see the most linked-to content. Sorted by referring domains—the number of unique sites linking to a given page.\n\nClicking the number of backlinks or domains for a given page will take you to a report for that specific URL.\n\nAnalyzing these pages helps you understand which content attracts the most backlinks in your niche. And how you can create similar or better content to get more links in the future. \n\nFinally, clicking the “Anchors” tab gives you a list of the linked text used for each backlink.\n\nThis report helps you see what text other sites use to link to your or a competitor’s pages. Which can reveal insights. \n\nFor example, let’s say a competitor has a lot of backlinks with anchor text that matches their brand name (like “bellroy” in the image above). This suggests they have a high level of brand awareness. \n\nOr perhaps you’ll spot links using anchor text that your similar pages don’t currently use as keywords. Which can give you optimization ideas.\n\nNote\n\nDon’t put too much focus on getting backlinks that use a particular type of anchor text or a specific term. The most natural backlink profiles typically contain a mix of anchor texts and types. \n\nYou can also check the anchor text used for links to specific pages. To better understand what terms other sites use to link to a particular page.\n\nWhile still in the “Anchors” tab, add the URL of the page you want to check in the input box. And select “Exact URL” in the drop-down at the top.\n\nThis will show anchor text specific to the page you want to analyze. \n\nFind Links to Any Site\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUse Backlink Gap\n\nThe Backlink Analytics tool lets you explore and analyze the links of any website in detail. But if you want to know how to check backlinks that your competitors have but you don’t, use the Backlink Gap tool.\n\nTo get started, enter your domain name and up to four competitors. Then click “Find prospects.”\n\nThe tool analyzes all the entered sites and shows you referring domains linking only to your competitors (this is what the default “Best” tab shows).\n\nThese are links you’re missing out on. \n\nLook for prospects with high Authority Scores (the “AS” column) and a high number of monthly visits. These are likely authoritative and popular sites.\n\nAnd because they link to all of your competitors, they’re likely to be relevant to your niche as well.\n\nThe tool also lets you filter domains by different categories, such as:\n\nWeak: These are the sites that link to you less frequently than to your competitors. Use this tab to find sites you may want to get more links from.\nStrong: These are the sites that link only to you and not to your competitors. Use this tab to see your unique link advantages.\nShared: These are the sites that link to both you and your competitors. Use this tab to see how you compare with your competitors in terms of link quantity and quality from these sites.\nUnique: These are the sites that link to only one specific domain, either yours or one of your competitors. Use this tab to see your competitors’ exclusive link sources. And try to replicate them.\nAll: This tab shows you all the links across all the entered domains. Which can highlight sites that link to some but not all of your competitors.\n\nOnce you come across a prospect you want to contact for a link, select it using the checkbox. Then click “Start Outreach.”\n\nA menu will popup. Select your site in the “Project:” section and click “Send prospects.”\n\nThis adds these prospects to the Link Building Tool—which we’ll go over later. \n\nFind Backlink Opportunities\n\nwith the Backlink Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Find Backlinks with Google Search Console\n\nGoogle Search Console (GSC) can help you find which sites link to you. Along with other useful information like the anchor text they use and how many links point to each page on your site.\n\nNote\n\nGSC can only be used for sites in your account and has some data limitations, so use it along with tools like Backlink Analytics and Backlink Gap as part of a comprehensive link-building campaign.\n\nHere’s how to find backlinks with Google Search Console:\n\nSign in to your Google Search Console account\nClick “Links” in the left-hand navigation menu\nReview the “External links” reports (“Top linked pages,” “Top linking sites,” and “Top liking text”)\nClick “More” to drill into specific reports\n\nThe “Top linked pages” report tells you how many incoming links each page has. Including how many sites those links come from.\n\nIdeally, you want a range of relevant and authoritative referring domains. Because that reflects a natural profile. \n\nSo, review your pages to see if you have a range of different sites linking to each one.\n\nYou can also click a specific page to review which domains link to it. \n\nClicking a domain will then show you the specific page on that domain the link comes from.\n\nThe “Top linking sites” report shows you which domains link to your site the most. And how many pages they each link to.\n\nClicking a site shows you which pages that site links to. And how many total external links (backlinks) come from that site in total.\n\nThis report can be useful for spotting pages that you may want to build more backlinks to. \n\nLastly, the “Top linking text” report tells you the link text (anchor text) used for the backlinks pointing to you. Sorted by frequency.\n\nUse this report to keep track of your anchor text. And make sure it’s relevant and varied. \n\nHow to Audit the Backlink Profile of Any Website\n\nWhile checking backlinks, you can also perform a quick audit to evaluate the overall quality of a site’s link profile.\n\nHere are some things to look for when doing a backlink audit:\n\nTotal number of backlinks: More links generally help, but remember that quality typically matters more than quantity. So, links from relevant, trusted websites are the most valuable.\nNumber of referring domains: A higher number of referring domains indicates a more diverse and natural link profile\nAuthority Scores of referring domains: Links from reputable, high-authority sites in your industry are best. And a high score is a good indication of a site that meets this criteria.\nAnchor text diversity: Varied, natural-looking anchor text is ideal. Rather than over-optimized, keyword-loaded links.\nLink velocity (the rate at which a site gains links): Steady, natural growth over time is preferred. Compared to an unnatural spike in links.\nFollow vs. nofollow links: “Follow” links can pass authority. Nofollow links don’t, but they can still send some benefits your way if they’re from popular websites (via traffic and/or brand awareness). \nLink location: Links higher up in content are typically seen as more valuable. As they’re more likely to be clicked by a user than those further down or nested in navigation bars.\nToxicity Score (a metric indicating the risk level of low-quality links): Links from low-quality, spammy sites can harm your site’s SEO if you have too many\n\nEvaluating these factors will give you a sense of the overall quality and SEO value of your site's link profile.\n\nUse Semrush’s Backlink Audit tool to gain insights into your website’s backlink profile.\n\nSet up a project in Backlink Audit and start the audit. Once it’s ready, you’ll see a report with the following details:\n\nThe overall Toxicity Score (based on the proportion of potentially toxic backlinks the site has):\n\nThe total number of referring domains, backlinks, and Authority Score:\n\nThe most-used anchor text for linking: \n\nAnd what percentage of links are follow versus nofollow:\n\nRegularly audit your backlinks to understand where you can improve in your link building efforts. \n\nReview Your Backlink Profile\n\nwith the Backlink Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nBuild Backlinks to Your Site (At Scale)\n\nRelevant backlinks from authoritative websites can help your own site rank higher in the search results. \n\nSo you can drive more organic traffic. And ultimately, turn more of that traffic into leads and sales.\n\nA good way to scale your link building efforts is by using Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nThis tool allows you to find new link building opportunities, manage outreach, and monitor your progress. All in one place.\n\nTo begin, create a project in the Link Building Tool. Or select a project if you’ve already created one.\n\nThen, go to the “Prospects” section, where you'll find a list of websites that could potentially link to you.\n\nCarefully review each site and select the ones you want to contact by clicking “To In Progress” to move them to the next stage.\n\nGo to the “In Progress” tab and choose a site to contact by clicking the “Contact” button next to their name.\n\nThen, write and send an outreach email to them.\n\nBe sure to follow proven outreach best practices like using personalization and providing value to the website owner.\n\nReady to try this tool and the other ones mentioned in this article?\n\nSign up for a free trial to start getting backlinks to your site today.\n\nFind, Analyze, and Build Backlinks\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
