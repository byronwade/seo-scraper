  "content": "What Is a CDN?\n\nA content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed system of servers that delivers web content—webpages, images, videos, etc.—to users based on their geographic location.\n\nCDNs have three main components:\n\nOrigin servers: The original servers that host the actual website content, such as text, images, videos, etc. Web content originates from these servers.\nEdge servers: CDNs spread servers geographically and locate them closer to end users. The edge servers store web content to deliver it faster to users.\nPoints of presence (PoPs): Data centers containing edge servers. PoPs act like transportation hubs. Content will stop at these data centers before moving to other edge server locations closer to users.\n\nCDNs have origin and edge servers closer to end users that store web content in temporary storage areas for faster access. This storage area is known as the “cache.”\n\nHow Does a CDN Work?\n\nCDNs can read your IP address and determine your location on the network. So when a user goes to a website that uses a CDN, the CDN looks at the user’s location and finds the edge server closest to them. \n\nHere’s an example of how a CDN could work:\n\nLet’s say your website’s origin server is in New York, and you have customers in Brisbane, Australia, who need to access your website.\n\nWhen the Brisbane visitors try to open pages or access content on your site—instead of having the request travel 10,000 miles across the globe to your New York server—the CDN routes it to the nearest edge server. \n\nSo rather than slow roundtrips traversing the globe, users in Brisbane get their page loads served up swiftly from an edge server much closer to them. \n\nLoading the cached version of a webpage can decrease your page load speed and improve the user experience. Users get to see the page they want right away without waiting for it to come from the main origin servers far away.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of a CDN?\n\nCDNs provide several performance, cost, and security benefits.\n\nImproving Website Load Times\n\nCDNs improve website load times by serving content from edge servers closer to visitors. \n\nLess travel distance for data means faster page load times.\n\nHowever, slower page load times can also be caused by other issues, such as poor coding, unoptimized images, or excessive page size. \n\nYou should identify and fix any non-CDN-related problems before implementing a CDN.\n\nTools like Semrush’s Site Audit can detect site issues impacting page load speed and provide fixes. \n\nHere’s how:\n\nFirst, click “Site Audit” from the left-hand menu and click “+ Create project” in the top right-hand corner. \n\nEnter your website URL and a project name and click “Create project.”\n\nConfigure your settings and click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nThen, click “View details” under the “Site Performance” heading.\n\nThis will take you to an overview of issues that could slow down your site. For example, JavaScript or CSS files that are too large:\n\nYou can see how to fix each issue by hovering over “Why and how to fix it” next to the item.\n\nFixing these site speed issues and adding a CDN can take page speeds to the next level.\n\nImprove Page Speed\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nReducing Bandwidth Costs\n\nSince edge servers handle most requests, CDNs can help you save on bandwidth costs and reduce traffic to origin servers.\n\nWithout a CDN: All visitor requests go straight to your central servers. This can overload your servers and bandwidth as site traffic grows. For example, your servers can easily be overloaded by traffic spikes from events like new product releases, software updates, and viral posts.\nWith a CDN: The edge servers handle most visitor requests. This reduces traffic to your origin server, lowering bandwidth usage and reducing costs from your central hosting infrastructure.\n\nSince CDNs cache content locally, your central servers don’t have to send the same files repeatedly. The CDN handles delivering data that has been cached to nearby visitors—reducing server costs on your end.\n\nImproving Website Uptime\n\nCDNs improve uptime by replicating content across multiple edge servers. If one server goes down, others remain online. This removes single points of failure.\n\nFor example, if an edge server in North America goes down, the local edge servers in Asia and Europe will continue serving visitors.\n\nStrengthening Website Security\n\nCDNs can strengthen website security by protecting against common threats like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nA DDoS attack aims to make a website or online service unavailable by flooding it with fake traffic from multiple sources. Like this: \n\nImage Source: Indusface\n\nCDNs prevent individual servers from being overwhelmed by distributing this fake traffic across their global network.\n\nSome CDNs also provide web application firewalls, DDoS protection services, and other security measures to detect and mitigate threats before they reach websites. \n\nConsiderations When Selecting a CDN\nCost Structure\n\nCDNs offer pricing models like usage-based, tiered, flat-rate, or hybrid plans based on data transfer and traffic volumes. \n\nHere’s how CDN pricing typically works:\n\nFlat-rate pricing: One monthly price regardless of usage\nTiered pricing: Pay a fixed monthly fee based on traffic volume\nHybrid models: Combine flat fees with usage charges beyond the allowance\nUsage-based pricing: Pay for the amount of data transferred/bandwidth used\n\nConsider running trial tests with projected traffic volumes across your key locations. This can help determine the most cost-effective CDN plan based on your usage and performance needs.\n\nLocation of Edge Servers\n\nThe CDN’s edge servers should align with your target market locations. So, review your website analytics to identify countries/regions that generate the most traffic for your site.\n\nFor example, you can check demographic details by country in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) under Reports > User Attributes > Demographic details: \n\nSelecting edge servers in key user locations after reviewing traffic analytics can mean faster load times for your target market. \n\nAdvanced Caching Options\n\nCDNs allow you to customize caching rules that control how and when content is stored and served from the cache. \n\nFor example, with CDNs, you can:\n\nSet Time to Live (TTL) policies. TTL specifies how long content stays cached before automatically expiring. Short TTLs prevent outdated copies for frequently updated content.\nConfigure rules to cache only certain file types or content. For example, you may want to cache common images but not cache restricted user profiles.\nManually purge cached content when needed. Such as clearing out old product pages after a redesign.\nSeparate caching rules for public versus private content. Public pages can be broadly cached, while private data may not be cached.\nPrioritize caching of frequently accessed static content. Like popular images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.\n\nFine-tuning the caching controls allows you to minimize costs, reduce origin server load, keep data fresh, and increase page load speeds. By selectively caching content based on your needs.\n\nSecurity Measures and Access Controls\n\nWhen evaluating CDNs, ensure they provide security protections such as:\n\nDDoS mitigation: The CDN should absorb and mitigate DDoS attacks before they reach your origin servers\nWeb Application Firewall (WAF): A WAF at edge servers can block common web threats and malicious bots\nAccess controls: Access controls allow you to control who can access your content. One way to do this is by creating an “allowlist” of approved IP addresses.\nHTTPS support: Encrypted HTTPS connections keep data secure as it travels through the CDN's servers\n\nStrong security measures are essential to safeguard your site and protect sensitive user data as it passes through the CDN.\n\nNotable CDN Providers\nFree and Low-Cost CDNs\nCloudflare\n\nCloudflare is a CDN and web security service that speeds up and protects websites. Cloudflare offers a free plan with an SSL certificate, DDoS protection, and a Web Application Firewall (WAF).\n\nTheir network of servers also spans over 300 cities and 100 countries and has been recognized as a leader in the 2022 IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Commercial Content Delivery Network Services.\n\nAmazon CloudFront\n\nAmazon CloudFront is another low-cost CDN service that Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides. It has security features similar to CloudFlare but a bigger network of servers.\n\nCloudFront also integrates natively with other AWS services. Which enables rapid deployment.\n\nCDNs Optimized for Media Delivery\nAkamai\n\nAkamai is a CDN that offers solutions for delivering media content like video streaming and large-scale downloads. \n\nIt has an Image & Video Manager solution that automatically optimizes images and videos for each user’s device and network connection to deliver the best experience.
