  "content": "There’s a way to spend less time managing your pay-per-click (PPC) ad campaigns while still getting a high return on your investment.\n\nIt’s called PPC automation. And it can save you time and improve your results.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn how PPC ad automation works, how to create automated PPC campaigns, and which PPC automation tools to use.\n\nLet’s start with the basics.\n\nWhat Is PPC Automation?\n\nPPC automation involves using specialized software to manage and optimize your pay-per-click ads automatically.\n\nThe tools adjust settings like ad spend, keyword selection, and ad placement (where your ads are displayed) based on real-time data and predictive analytics. Often with just minutes of your time.\n\nThis allows for more precise ad placement and timing. Which means you reach potential customers more efficiently and likely with lower PPC costs.\n\nBenefits of PPC Automation\n\nPPC ad automation can help you achieve your campaign goals faster and more cost-effectively. Here are some of its benefits:\n\nEnhanced ROI\n\nAutomation tools continuously monitor your ad performance, adjusting bids (the amount you’re willing to pay for a click) and placements in real time. \n\nThey ensure maximum visibility and engagement by directing your budget toward the best-performing ads.\n\nThe result? A higher return on investment (ROI) for every advertising dollar you spend.\n\nImproved Efficiency\n\nInstead of manually setting bids, selecting placements, or sifting through data, automation handles this for you. \n\nIt can evaluate keyword performance, tweak ad schedules (when your ads are shown), and pause ads that aren’t performing well. \n\nYour campaigns remain optimized and you save time.\n\nMore Precise Targeting\n\nAutomation leverages data to fine-tune your audience targeting in real time. So you don’t have to go through the trouble of manually refining targeting criteria every hour or day based on recent ad performance.\n\nIt can analyze patterns like user behavior and search habits to ensure your ads are displayed to those most likely to take action.\n\nReduced Errors\n\nAutomation streamlines tasks like bid adjustments and ad placements. This minimizes human errors.\n\nWhether it’s mitigating the risk of overbidding (paying too much) or mistargeting, automation can keep your campaigns on an error-free path.\n\nBetter Scalability\n\nAs you introduce more products or venture into new markets, the complexity of managing ads increases.\n\nAutomation tools can more effectively handle expansion. \n\nThey can help you manage more ads and reach broader audiences without adding stress. Ensuring your advertising efforts remain effective.\n\nNote\n\nWhile PPC automation can streamline ad campaigns, regular monitoring is still recommended to ensure your campaigns remain aligned with your goals, target audience, and budget.\n\nNow that you know the advantages of PPC automation, let’s talk about how you can automate PPC campaigns.\n\nPPC Campaign Elements You Can Automate\n\nRunning a PPC campaign is a process with multiple components. From research to budget management to reporting.\n\nLet’s take an example of Google Ads. Here are five important components you can automate:\n\nBidding\n\nManually managing bids is time-consuming. It also leaves room for inconsistencies and oversights.\n\nConsider the challenge of manually tracking hundreds of keywords across a variety of search ad campaigns—each with unique performance metrics and competition. The task would be enormous.\n\nPPC automated bidding uses real-time data to adjust your bids automatically. If, for example, there’s a spike in searches for your product on weekends, the system can automatically increase your bid during that time. \n\nThis approach eliminates the need for you to monitor and adjust bids constantly.\n\nWith automated bidding, you can optimize your budget, reduce human error, and ensure your ads connect with the right audience when they’re most likely to engage.\n\nHow to Get Started with Automated Bidding\n\nHere’s a breakdown of Google Ads’ popular automated bidding strategies:\n\nMaximize clicks: Sets your bid to maximize the number of clicks your ad gets while staying within your budget\nEnhanced cost per click (ECPC): Automatically adjusts your bids to get clicks that are more likely to convert\nMaximize conversions: Automatically adjusts bids to encourage as many people as possible to take your desired action\nMaximize conversion value: Uses automation to optimize your bids so they drive high-value conversions\nTarget CPA: Controls total budget by letting you set how much you want to spend on each action\nTarget return on ad spend (ROAS): Allows you to maximize outcomes by setting a specific goal for how much return you want to get on your ad spend\n\nWhich bidding strategy is right for you depends on your goals for that specific campaign.\n\nFor example, maximizing clicks might be best if you’re aiming to boost brand visibility. But choosing a target return on ad spend is more appropriate if you’re focused on getting a specific return for every dollar spent.\n\nOnce you’ve decided which bidding strategy you want to use, here’s how to implement it. \n\nLog in to Google Ads. \n\nSelect “Campaigns” from the menu on the left. \n\nClick on the name of the campaign you’d like to edit. \n\nThen, in the “Bidding” menu, you’ll find the option to choose your automated bid strategy. \n\nCreative Testing\n\nTesting ad variations helps identify which combinations of headlines, descriptions, and/or images engage your target audience most effectively.\n\nHowever, doing this manually can be tedious and the process is prone to errors.\n\nAutomating creative testing simplifies this by pinpointing the top performers based on real-time analysis of different ad combinations.\n\nFor instance, in search ads, if one headline and description combination consistently outperforms others during weekday afternoons, Google will prioritize showing that combination during those times.\n\nThis ensures consistent ad optimization. Saving you hours of manual work and increasing your campaign’s effectiveness—especially if you’re running multiple ads.\n\nHow to Get Started with Automating Ad Creative Testing\n\nYou need to have multiple variations of your ad creative. Upload them on the ad platform. \n\nGo to Google Ads and create a new search ad campaign. You will find the option to input multiple versions of headlines and descriptions.\n\nThis feature enables the ad platform to test different combinations automatically and show the one most likely to be effective for your target audience.\n\nOnce your campaign is live, the platform will continuously monitor performance. And automatically adjust which creative elements are shown based on real-time data.\n\nTip\n\nAfter launching your campaign, review how different creative combinations performed. You can use this data to refine your asset pool for future campaigns, keeping what works and discarding what doesn’t.\n\nCampaign Management\n\nCampaign management involves planning, executing, and monitoring your PPC campaigns. It’s where you select keywords, set bids, choose creatives, and track performance.\n\nAutomated PPC management tools make managing your PPC campaigns more efficient. \n\nIt allows you to automatically monitor campaign performance in real time and make adjustments based on predefined criteria.\n\nFor instance, you can set a rule that if a campaign’s click-through rate drops below a certain threshold, it will automatically pause. And if a campaign is performing well, automation can increase your bid to capitalize on its success. \n\nHow to Get Started with Automated Campaign Management\n\nStart by reviewing what part of campaign management you want to automate. Look for areas that require frequent adjustments.\n\nNext, go to Google Ads and head over to the “Tools” tab.\n\nClick “Bulk actions” and choose “Rules” from the drop-down menu.\n\nNow create your automated rules. You will find numerous ways to automate your campaign in the menu.\n\nLet’s say you typically make more sales on the weekends. So you want to automate PPC budgeting to increase your campaign budget on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to reach more people.\n\nHere, you need to create two rules:\n\nOne will help increase your budget on Friday\nAnother one will bring your budget down to the original sum on Monday\n\nClick “Campaign rules” and configure your automation rules.\n\nUnder “Action,” choose “Change budgets” and set your increased budget for the weekend.\n\nIn the frequency, select “Weekly” > “Friday.” And choose the time “12:00 AM - 1:00 AM.”\n\nSave the rule. This will increase your budget every Friday.\n\nFollow the same steps to set your second rule, which will bring your budget back to normal every Monday.\n\nOnce set, your ad budget will automatically increase and decrease on the selected days.\n\nSimilarly, you can create other automated rules based on your needs. From scheduling higher bids during specific hours of the day to pausing ads based on specific metrics.\n\nAudience Targeting\n\nAutomated audience targeting leverages machine learning to dynamically adjust the audience segments your ads are targeting. \n\nThis ensures your ads are displayed to the individuals most likely to engage with them.\n\nFor example: \n\nIf the data shows that a younger demographic is interacting more with your ads, the system can reallocate more of your budget to target that specific age group.\n\nBy automating the audience-targeting process, you’re not just setting and forgetting; you’re continually optimizing, which leads to better ROI.\n\nHow to Get Started with Automated Audience Targeting\n\nYou can automate your PPC display ads using the Optimized targeting feature in Google Ads.\n\nIt uses real-time conversion data (users who have converted) to create similar profiles of other users. It then improves your campaign’s performance by displaying ads to audiences that match that profile.\n\nOptimized targeting can help you reach audience segments more likely to convert.\n\nIt is turned on by default for all campaigns. You can turn it off in ad group settings, under “Targeting” > “Audience segments.”\n\nReporting\n\nAutomated reporting streamlines the collection and presentation data from your PPC campaigns.\n\nReports are generated at regular intervals, saving you time by removing the need for manual report creation.\n\nAutomation also eliminates human errors during manual data collection and interpretation.\n\nFor example, if you want to track the performance of a particular campaign every Monday morning, automated reporting can have that data ready for you right at the start of the week.\n\nWith PPC report automation, you get accurate, timely insights without the manual hassle. This lets you make informed decisions quickly and keeps your campaigns effective.\n\nHow to Get Started with Automated Reporting\n\nYou can automate your reporting process using Google Ad Manager’s scheduling feature.\n\nThis feature allows you to set up reports to be generated at specified intervals, ensuring you receive timely insights tailored to your needs.\n\nGo to your Google Ad Manager account and click “Reports” from the top navigation.\n\nCreate a new report or edit an existing one. Navigate to the “Editors and scheduling” section and schedule your report.\n\nYou can choose the frequency and date range of the scheduled report—when and how often you want the report emailed.\n\nYou can also share the reports with your team members and external stakeholders.\n\n3 Other Types of PPC Automation Tools\n\nBeyond the built-in automation features provided by Google Ads, you can use three other types of PPC automation tools based on your use case.\n\nLet’s take a look at each type.\n\n1. Scripts\n\nScripts are custom code snippets (usually written in JavaScript) that you can add to your ad platform in order to automate more complex tasks. \n\nThis option requires a certain level of coding skill and a deep understanding of the ad platform’s functionalities. \n\nGoogle Ads offer a library of pre-made scripts. For example, it has a source code to bid based on current weather.\n\nThere are a number of pre-made scripts available online. Usually for free. \n\nYou can even experiment with writing your own using tools like ChatGPT. \n\nTip\n\nScripted automation can have drastic impacts on spending. Be sure to test scripts thoroughly before implementing them at scale.\n\n2. Third-Party Tools\n\nThird-party tools (which we’ll cover more in the next section) include PPC automation software solutions developed by companies other than the ad platforms themselves. You can typically subscribe to them with monthly recurring charges.\n\nThese tools offer advanced automation features, ranging from budget distribution to reporting. \n\nThey’re designed for those who need more sophistication than built-in features and scripts can offer. They are often used to manage campaigns across multiple ad platforms.\n\n3. Custom Builds\n\nCustom builds are PPC automation software programs tailor-made by developers. \n\nThis approach is most suitable for large companies with unique PPC needs that can’t be met by existing tools. \n\nIt requires significant development expertise and resources but offers the most customization.\n\n5 Third-Party PPC Automation Tools to Try\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the best PPC automation software tools from third-parties:\n\n1.
