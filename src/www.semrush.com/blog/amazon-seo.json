  "content": "If you sell products on Amazon, one of your key concerns should be how to rank your products higher in its search results. This is where Amazon SEO can help.\n\nIn this Amazon SEO guide, we’ll go over the top strategies you can use to drive more traffic to your Amazon product listings and generate more sales.\n\nWhat Is Amazon SEO? Why Does It Matter for Product Rankings?\n\nAmazon SEO is the process of optimizing Amazon product listings to increase their chances of ranking high in Amazon’s product search results.\n\nAmazon listing optimization can help:\n\nImprove product and brand visibility\nDrive more traffic to product listings\nGenerate more Amazon product sales\nHow Amazon’s A10 Ranking Algorithm Works\n\nThe algorithm Amazon uses to rank products in search results is called A10. Its purpose is to determine the most relevant products to display for shoppers’ searches.\n\nThe difference between A10 and search engine algorithms (e.g., those of Google, Bing, and the like) is that A10 is designed to solely address transactional intent. \n\nIn other words, Amazon users aren’t looking to learn new information or perform research—they’re specifically interested in making a purchase.\n\nBecause of this, Amazon’s algorithm favors products that are the most likely to drive sales.\n\nA10 examines multiple factors when determining how to rank products, including:\n\nKeywords: Including relevant search terms throughout your product listing helps signal to Amazon that your product is relevant for a particular search\nConversion rate: It’s in Amazon’s interest that the product listings it displays to shoppers convert well. This means that having a higher conversion rate is likely to help with getting your product listing to the top of Amazon search results\nReviews: Positive reviews help nudge shoppers toward making a purchase. Having a lot of positive reviews on your product listing means better conversion rates, which, in turn, lead to better rankings in search results\nSales history: A product listing that generates a large number of sales is popular for a reason. Having a long sales history signals to Amazon that your product listing is worth showcasing to shoppers.\nHow to Improve SEO on Amazon: Tips & Best Practices\n\nFollow these tips to improve your Amazon SEO and give your products the chance to rank higher in search results:\n\nKeyword Research and Analysis for Amazon SEO\n\nYour Amazon SEO strategy starts with keyword research.\n\nAmazon keyword research will give you an understanding of the best keywords to target with your product listings. Ideally, you should target one primary keyword and one secondary keyword with each of your product listings.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, your best bet is to target long-tail keywords. These are highly specific search queries (think “wireless headphones for kids 8-12” vs. just “wireless headphones”), which usually have less competition and are therefore easier to rank for.\n\nAmazon allows you to add two types of keywords to your listings: frontend and backend keywords.\n\nFrontend keywords are those you use throughout your product listing (e.g., in the product title and description) and are visible to shoppers.\n\nBackend keywords aren’t visible to shoppers. But Amazon still takes them into account when ranking your products in search. They’re a great way to help Amazon associate your product with relevant searches without having to cram more keywords into your product listing. \n\nBackend keywords are added in the “Keywords” tab of your product listing in Amazon Seller Central.\n\nSellerApp\n\nBut how do you figure out which keywords to use for your product listings?\n\nHere are three methods you can use:\n\nUsing Amazon’s Auto-Complete Feature\n\nThe Amazon search box is the best starting point for keyword research. Once you start typing in a search term, it will suggest relevant and related terms.\n\nSimply type in your seed keyword, and Amazon’s search feature will suggest related keywords.\n\nFor more suggested terms, you can hit space and start typing in letters from A to Z to see what kind of suggestions Amazon gives you.\n\nYou can also try adding prepositions like “for,” “in,” “to,” “on,” “with,” and “without” to try to get more suggestions.\n\nThen, repeat the process with each suggested search term to get even more keyword ideas.\n\nUsing Ecommerce Keyword Analytics\n\nUse Ecommerce Keyword Analytics app to streamline the Amazon keyword research process.\n\nHere's how:\n\nEnter your main product keyword and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll get a report with the following important metrics:\n\nNumber of search requests\nNumber of product clicks\nNumber of orders\nNumber of conversions\nNumber of clicks per search (CPS)\n\nWe recommend adding more keywords in the “Compare different keywords” section. To get more detailed graphs and data.\n\nExplore the \"Related Keywords\" section to find additional, relevant keywords and keyword data.\n\nUse these insights to select highly effective keywords. And optimize your Amazon product listings for better visibility and increased sales.\n\nOptimizing Product Titles and Descriptions for Maximum Impact\n\nThe product title is one of the main things Amazon’s A10 search algorithm uses to determine whether a product listing is relevant for a particular search.\n\nAmazon offers clear product title requirements sellers need to adhere to:\n\nTitles should be up to 80 characters long\nAvoid using all caps. Use title case instead.\nAvoid promotional phrases (e.g., “free shipping”)\nUse numerals (e.g., “3” instead of “three”)\nDon’t include size and color variations in the title\n\nIf you don’t follow these requirements, Amazon might suppress your product listing in search results.\n\nYour product title should include the primary keyword you’re looking to rank your product listing for.\n\nAs for product descriptions, Amazon suggests that sellers include the following information:\n\nBrand name\nSize (e.g., shirt size)\nType of material (e.g., cotton)\nOther relevant details (e.g., color, quantity, packaging)\n\nThere are also specific guidelines for individual product categories. Make sure to check the guidelines for your product’s category when writing the description.\n\nThe product description is also a good place to add more relevant keywords but make sure not to overdo it—including a couple of keywords should be enough.\n\nTip\n\nYou can use the Product Research Pulse app to analyze your competitors' products on Amazon. \n \n\nSimply enter a competitor’s product information into the app to access AI-generated recommendations for titles, descriptions, and bullet points. \n \n\nBullet Points and Product Features Optimization\n\nAmazon gives sellers the option to add short bullet points to their job listing. These should give shoppers a quick overview of the product’s features and benefits.\n\nAmazon recommends using the bullet points section to highlight your product’s top five features. \n\nIt also offers a few guidelines you need to follow:\n\nStart each bullet point with a capital letter\nWrite numbers as numerals\nSpell out measurements (e.g., “inches”)\nDon’t use hyphens, periods, symbols, or exclamation points\nDon’t include company, shipping, pricing, or promotional information\n\nAmazon allows sellers to add up to five bullet points for each product. If you’re a vendor, you can add up to 10 bullet points.\n\nAmazon recommends keeping your entire bullet point section under 1,000 characters. So, aim for around 200 characters per bullet point.\n\nYou should start each bullet point with a benefit of your product. Then, connect that benefit to a feature.\n\nWe recommend making the first bullet point about your product’s most important benefit and feature. Then, move on to the second most important. And so on.\n\nFor example, let’s say you’re selling a pet carrier. You might want to lead with the fact that your pet carrier is well-ventilated thanks to a number of ventilation holes. This will help ease shoppers’ minds about their pet being able to breathe comfortably while being transported in the carrier.\n\nThen, you could move on to less important features and benefits, such as the carrier being easy to clean.\n\nNote that the features and benefits you discuss in your product listing need to be specific to the product, not the brand or the manufacturer. Remember to use unique copy for your bullet points—don’t just copy the manufacturer’s product description.\n\nBullet points should also be scannable and easy to read. So, make them concise.\n\nAlso, include a few relevant keywords from your research within the bullet points.\n\nCreating High-Quality Product Images and A+ Content\n\nAdding high-quality product images to your Amazon product listing is essential. Images help increase click-through rates from search results and entice shoppers to make a purchase.\n\nAmazon allows you to add up to nine images to your product listing (but only seven will be visible on your listing). You should take advantage of this and use up all the slots to highlight your product’s features.\n\nMake sure to comply with Amazon’s image requirements while doing so:\n\nUse photos—not drawings or illustrations\nA white background is mandatory\nThe minimum size is 500 x 500 pixels—images should ideally be 1,600 pixels or larger on the longest side and not exceed 10,000 pixels\nResolution should be at least 72 dpi\nSupported file formats include JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and GIF (non-animated)\nNeed to match the product in color and size\nThe product needs to fill at least 85% of the image\nImages can’t be pixelated, blurry, contain nudity, or be sexually suggestive\n\nThere are additional requirements for your listing’s main image:\n\nThe image needs to have a pure white background\nYou’re only allowed to feature accessories or props that are included in the purchase\nThe image can’t include text, borders, logos, or watermarks\nThe entire product must be in the image\nYou need to show the product outside of its packaging\n\nApart from using high-quality images, you can also grab shoppers’ attention by using A+ content.\n\nA+ content is a feature provided by Amazon that allows sellers to enrich their product listings by replacing the default product description section with an enhanced version that can contain:\n\nUnique text and image layouts\nCustom headers\nHD videos\nInfographics\nCharts\nComparison tables\n\nAccording to Amazon, using A+ content in your product listings helps to generate more attention from shoppers and results in higher conversion rates.\n\nTo use A+ content, your brand needs to register with Amazon’s Brand Registry Program.\n\nTo enroll, you need to have an active registered trademark in the country where you’d like to enroll, as well as the ability to display your logo or brand name on all the products and packaging you sell through Amazon.\n\nHere’s how to add A+ content to your Amazon product listings:\n\nStart by logging into your Seller Central account.\n\nGo to “Advertising” > “A+ Content Manager” on the left-hand menu.\n\nZonGuru\n\nThen, click the “Start creating A+ content” button.\n\nJungle Scout\n\nSelect the type of A+ content you’d like to create. The two available options are Basic and Brand Story.\n\nJungle Scout\n\nOn the next screen, enter a name for your A+ content and choose a language.\n\nThen, click “Add module” to start adding A+ modules to your product listing.\n\nJungle Scout\n\nYou can choose from a variety of different modules, as shown below:\n\nJungle Scout\n\nOnce you’ve added and customized your modules, it’s time to select the products you’d like the modules to apply to. \n\nTo do this, enter the product ASINs (Amazon Standard Identification Numbers) in the box under the “Add ASINs” section.\n\nAlternatively, you can click the “Bulk upload” button to upload product ASINs in bulk.\n\nAMALYTIX\n\nOnce complete, click “Next: Review & submit.”\n\nAMALYTIX\n\nHere, you can review how your products look with the A+ content modules added. If everything looks good, click the “Submit for approval” button.\n\nAMALYTIX\n\nYou’ll then need to wait for Amazon to review and approve your product listings. This can take up to seven days.\n\nOnce your product listing is approved, it will go live and will be visible to shoppers.\n\nGenerating Positive Product Reviews and Ratings\n\n41% of consumers state they always read product reviews before making a purchase on Amazon. \n\nIt’s crucial that your products have positive reviews and high ratings. Think about it—why would Amazon show shoppers low-rated products with bad reviews on the first page of search results?\n\nApart from showing Amazon that your products are high quality, positive reviews and high ratings also help increase your click-through and conversion rates. They provide social proof and help shoppers decide to make a purchase.\n\nSo, how do you generate more positive reviews and get high ratings? Here are a few tactics you can use:\n\nUse the “Request a Review” button. Amazon offers sellers an easy way to gather reviews from customers. All you need to do is click the “Request a Review” button next to an order, and Amazon will automatically send the customer a review request email.\nDescribe your product accurately. A lot of bad reviews stem from misleading product descriptions. Describe your product accurately to ensure customers know exactly what they’re getting.\nUse packing inserts. Create and print packing inserts that ask customers to leave a review. Add these inserts to each package you send.\nProvide excellent customer service. One of the best ways to ensure positive product reviews and high ratings is to make sure your customer service is on point. Answer customers’ questions and respond to issues and negative reviews promptly.\n\nAvoid using shady tactics to generate positive product reviews. For example, having friends and family review your products. Or buying reviews from websites that offer this service.\n\nAmazon is getting better at spotting fake reviews and will catch on to shady tactics eventually.\n\nPricing and Promotional Strategies to Improve Rankings\n\nA lot of your potential customers will be price-conscious. Because of this, the price of your products will impact the overall conversion rate.\n\nFor example, if your product is priced much higher than competing products, it’s likely to convert at a lower rate. \n\nThink about it—why would shoppers buy the same or similar product from you if they can get it much cheaper from a competing seller?\n\nThen, if your product doesn’t convert very well, Amazon might display it less frequently in search results. Which further damages your sales.\n\nThis makes it crucial to find the optimal pricing and promotional strategy for your products. \n\nHere are a few tactics you can use:\n\nStart with a Lower Price if You Have No Reviews\n\nAlso known as penetrative pricing, this strategy aims to jumpstart sales for a new product by keeping the pricing fairly low compared to the competition.\n\nThe idea here is to build brand awareness and generate reviews and ratings quickly by maximizing the number of sales.\n\nKeep in mind that you should only use this strategy in the short term.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it doesn’t result in an optimal profit margin and can lead to pricing wars with your competitors. Once you gain a decent number of reviews and boost your product rating, you can improve your pricing to optimize profits.\n\nOffer a Discount\n\nAmazon gives you the option to offer discounts to customers via coupons.\n\nIt displays the coupon offer under the product’s price in the search results. It can help boost both click-throughs and conversion rates.\n\nSet Up Automated Pricing Rules\n\nYou can set up rules to have Amazon automatically update product pricing based on specific events (e.g., a competitor modifies the price for their product). \n\nThis will ensure your pricing stays optimal at all times and eliminates the need for manual pricing changes.\n\nDrive More Sales with Amazon SEO\n\nReady to boost your Amazon SEO performance? \n\nFollow these Amazon SEO best practices to improve your Amazon product SEO, boost products’ rankings in Amazon search results, and drive more traffic and sales.",
