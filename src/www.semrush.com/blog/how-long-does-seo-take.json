  "content": "It typically takes 4-12 months for SEO to work, according to a Google video. \n\nIn most cases, SEOs need four months to a year to help your business first implement improvements and then see potential benefit.\n\n— Maile Ohye, Google\n\nBut the exact timeline depends on various factors. Which we’ll explore later.\n\nWhy Does SEO Take So Long to Work?\n\nIt can take a long time for SEO to work because Google considers many factors when ranking search results. And there are often hundreds of pages competing for the same spots.\n\nSo you’ll need to equal or beat the competition on multiple fronts, covering:\n\nRelevance: Does your page satisfy searchers’ needs better than rival pages?\nQuality: Is your content more helpful and trustworthy than rival content?\nUsability: Does your page offer a better user experience than rival pages?\n\nPlus, Google’s ranking systems are extremely complex, somewhat secretive, and ever-changing. So it’s not always obvious what you must do to rank higher.\n\nFor the best SEO results, you need to do lots of learning, creating, testing, analyzing, and adapting.\n\n5 Factors That Affect Your SEO Timeline\n\nYour goals, resources, strategy, competition, and website’s history all affect your SEO timeline.\n\nLet’s explore each factor:\n\n1. Your Goals\n\nHow long it takes to get SEO results depends on what SEO results you’re pursuing.\n\nTheoretically, it’s possible to optimize a page and see ranking improvements the next day.\n\nBut achieving substantial and sustainable SEO results across your site typically takes months of consistent effort.\n\nMost marketers focus on the following metrics:\n\nRanking: Where your page or content appears in search results for specific keywords\nOrganic traffic: The number of unpaid visits from search engines\nOrganic conversions: The number of organic visits that lead to conversions (e.g., purchases)\n\nIf your goal is to rank for low-competition keywords, you should start seeing results within a few months.\n\nBut if your benchmark for SEO success is conversions, then it may take at least six months for you to start getting results.\n\nCheck out our guide on SEO forecasting for advice on predicting what results you can get.\n\n2. Your Resources\n\nThe more time and money you invest in SEO, the quicker you can achieve results. \n\nBecause:\n\nSEO changes won’t take as long to make\nYou can invest in the best SEO tools\nYou can hire the most qualified people\n\nHowever, you must spend resources effectively.\n\nIt’s important to create quality content and build quality backlinks. Rather than focusing on quantity. And invest in the technical SEO tasks that really matter. \n\nIn other words, you need an effective strategy.\n\n3. Your Strategy\n\nWithout an effective SEO strategy, you might never see results. Let alone achieve them quickly.\n\nSo, it’s crucial to identify the right tactics. And prioritize them according to your business’s needs.\n\nSemrush’s On Page SEO Checker can help.\n\nDuring the setup process, enter your target keywords and URLs. \n\nThe tool will then compare your pages against top-ranking pages. And provide a prioritized list of URLs to optimize.\n\nClick “# ideas” to view any page’s recommendations in full. \n\nYou’ll find sections on strategy, content, backlinks, technical issues, and more.\n\nFurther reading: SEO Strategy: How to Create One for 2024 (+ Template)\n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Your Competition\n\nThe more competitive your niche, the longer it takes to get SEO results.\n\nFor example, many laptop-related keywords are hard to rank for. Because key players like Amazon and Best Buy can invest significantly in SEO.\n\nPlus, their brand power helps them rank highly—and take clicks from rivals.\n\nYou can analyze your competitive positioning in Semrush’s Organic Research tool.\n\nEnter your domain, choose your country, and click “Search.” \n\nThen, go to the “Competitors” report.\n\nThe graph shows how your organic search traffic compares to competitors’ traffic.\n\nFor further insights, use the following tools:\n\nKeyword Gap: Find out which keywords competitors outrank you for\nBacklink Gap: See which sites link to competitors but not to you\n\nThe bigger the gap between you and your rivals, the longer it can take for SEO results to show.\n\n5. Your Website’s History\n\nIt typically takes longer to achieve SEO results on a new domain than an established domain (over one year old).\n\nGoogle’s John Mueller said rankings fluctuate more significantly in a website’s first year. Because “that’s kind of a time where our algorithms are still trying to figure out how and where we should show your website in the search results overall.”\n\nEstablished websites are also more likely to have built authority, rankings, and backlinks (links from other sites) that help their SEO.\n\nOn the other hand, an older website might be plagued by SEO mistakes. Perhaps it’s affected by a manual action (Google penalty). Or has a large volume of potentially harmful backlinks.\n\nThis can mean it takes longer to achieve SEO results.\n\n4 Ways to Get SEO Results More Quickly\n\nLet’s explore four ways to improve your SEO and get results more quickly.\n\nSome of these SEO changes can take a long time to implement. But they can make the biggest difference to your site’s SEO health. And expedite the route to SEO success.\n\n1. Focus on Low-Difficulty Keywords \n\nLow-difficulty keywords are search queries that are relatively easy to rank for. If you target these rather than higher-difficulty keywords, SEO results should show more quickly.\n\nYou can find low-difficulty keywords with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a keyword to base your search around (e.g., “laptop”). Then, choose your country and click “Search.”\n\nThe tool provides a list of keywords that contain your starting keyword or a close variation.\n\nUse the “KD %” filter to focus on keywords with lower keyword difficulty scores (e.g., 0-29).\n\nThen, perform keyword analysis to find relevant queries with the most potential.\n\nFor example, a laptop retailer could create a blog post targeting “black spot on laptop screen”—a keyword that gets 1,900 searches per month and could attract potential customers. Yet is relatively easy to rank for.\n\n2. Tweak Pages in Positions 4-10\n\nIf you’re ranking in position 4-10 for a keyword, Google already thinks your page is relevant. A minor tweak could be all you need to rank higher. And fast.\n\nIn these positions, small ranking improvements can lead to lots of extra clicks.\n\nHere’s the average click-through rate (CTR) by position, according to Backlinko research:\n\nYou can track your Google rankings for free in Google Search Console.\n\nBut Semrush’s Position Tracking tool makes the process easier. And provides additional insights.\n\nOnce you’ve configured the tool, click the bell icon at the top to create ranking alerts.\n\nFor example, get notified when a keyword leaves the top three positions. So you can take corrective action as soon as possible.\n\nIn the “Overview” report, use the “Top positions & changes” filter to find keywords in positions 4-10.\n\nLike this:\n\nAnd scroll down to see your results.\n\nKeywords with the lowest keyword difficulty scores and highest search volumes are the best candidates for improvement. Especially if they correspond with pages of high commercial importance.\n\nHere are some quick wins that can help you boost rankings:\n\nAdd the target keyword to your page’s title tag, H1 tag, and opening paragraph\nMake sure your content is accurate and up to date\nOptimize images to improve page speed\n\nFor more advice, follow our on-page SEO checklist.\n\nTrack Your Rankings with Ease\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Fix Technical SEO Errors\n\nSome technical SEO errors make it extremely difficult or even impossible to rank. For example, if Google cannot crawl and index a page properly, the page can’t appear in search results.\n\nSo, it’s crucial to conduct a technical SEO audit and fix major issues as soon as possible.\n\nWith Semrush’s Site Audit tool, you can check up to 100 URLs for free.\n\nAfter setting it up, head to the “Issues” report. The most pressing issues are listed in the “Errors” section.\n\nClick “Why and how to fix it” for advice on resolving an error.\n\nYou can create tasks in the Semrush CRM, Trello, or Zapier using the “Send to…” button.\n\nMake sure to rerun the campaign after making improvements. So you can track your progress.\n\n4. Delete or Improve Unhelpful Content\n\nGoogle says that “removing unhelpful content could help the rankings of your other content.” \n\nUnhelpful content is content that fails to meet users’ expectations—perhaps because it’s poorly written, lacking in detail, or inaccurate.\n\nTo identify unhelpful content, perform a content audit.\n\nThen, decide what action to take:\n\nRemove: If the content performs poorly on key content metrics and has little potential, deleting could be your best option \nRedirect: If you have multiple pages that cover the same topic, consider combining them into one helpful resource. And redirecting accordingly.\nImprove: If the page has potential to generate significant traffic and conversions, improve it. Check out our advice on creating quality content. \n\nMake sure to prioritize tasks based on the required resources and potential benefits.\n\nGet SEO Results More Quickly with Semrush\n\nSemrush tools allow you to streamline your workflow and gather valuable insights.
