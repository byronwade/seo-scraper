  "content": "What Is a Pillar Page?\n\nPillar pages—also called pillar posts or content pillars—are pieces of content that serve as the cornerstone of a topic cluster—a group of pages created to establish a website’s authority on a specific subject.\n\nThey provide a comprehensive overview of a broad topic and link to related content pieces.\n\nFor example, let’s say you want to create a topic cluster on SEO.\n\nYour pillar page could be a complete article covering SEO basics. Among other topics, you’d mention technical SEO, link building, and local SEO.\n\nFrom your pillar page, you would add links to cluster pages. These would dive deeper into the subtopics mentioned on your pillar page.\n\nYour pillar page acts as a content hub. And guides users to more specific content pieces. \n\nHow Pillar Pages Can Help Your SEO \n\nPillar pages benefit your SEO rankings by helping you:\n\nBuild Topical Authority\n\nPillar pages aid in building topical authority by forcing you to comprehensively cover a topic. First, as an overview on the pillar page itself, and then in more detail on cluster pages.\n\nAs part of SEO, pillar pages and accompanying cluster content allow you to showcase your expertise and provide a clear signal to search engines that you’re an authority on the topic.\n\nSimplify Navigation\n\nPillar pages help structure your content and make it easier for both visitors and search engines to navigate.\n\nThis helps visitors find the information they’re looking for more quickly. And improves the overall user experience (UX), which is something Google aims to reward.\n\nAvoid Keyword Cannibalization\n\nStructuring your content with pillar pages and topic clusters in mind can help you avoid keyword cannibalization—multiple website pages competing to rank for the same keyword.\n\nHere’s how: \n\nIf you’re not using topic clusters, you’re likely creating content based on a list of keywords derived from keyword research. And some of the keywords from your list might have similar (or the same) search intent.\n\nWith pillar pages and topic clusters, you take a different approach and plan out your pages based on the information they need to include and the topics they need to cover. Instead of starting with keywords.\n\nThis helps you prevent keyword cannibalization because you can avoid getting into a situation where you’re creating two pages on the same topic.\n\nImprove Your Internal Linking Structure\n\nPlanning out topic clusters and pillar pages requires you to be intentional about how your website pages will be connected.\n\nIf you do it right, the pillar page will link to all the pages within a topic cluster. And all the cluster pages will link to the pillar page. And some—if not all—of the cluster pages will link to each other. \n\nThis results in a more logical internal linking structure which is easier for search engines to understand.\n\nGenerate Backlinks\n\nSince pillar pages are in-depth takes on a topic, they often attract more backlinks compared to less comprehensive pieces of content.\n\nPillar pages get shared more often. And they get cited more often, too. All of this results in more backlinks for the website.\n\nHow to Create a Pillar Page\n\nTo create a pillar page, follow these steps:\n\n1. Brainstorm Topic Ideas\n\nStart by thinking about which core topics are most relevant to your website and audience. For example, the following might be core topics for a fitness blog:\n\nStrength training\nWeight loss\nFitness supplements\n\nAll three could be potential pillar pages.\n\nLet’s take the first topic as an example. To create a pillar page on strength training, you’ll want to cover every aspect of it. Here are some potential subtopics you could cover on this pillar page:\n\nBenefits of strength training\nStrength training exercises\nStrength training equipment\nAdvanced strength training techniques\n\nAll of the above, apart from being sections in your new pillar page, could also be standalone cluster pages.\n\nUse the Topic Research tool to get ideas for what information to include on your pillar page. Here’s how:\n\nStart by entering the topic of your pillar page. Then click “Get content ideas.”\n\nThe tool will then generate a report. Here, you’ll be able to see a list of subtopics related to your core topic.\n\nYou can click on “Show more” at the bottom of each card to learn more about a particular subtopic.\n\nHere, you’ll be able to see:\n\nThe total search volume for that subtopic\nHow difficult it is to rank for related keywords\nHeadlines used by pages covering that subtopic\nCommonly asked questions about the subtopic\nRelated searches\n\nYou can review this information for every individual subtopic. Or export all data for all subtopics by clicking the “Export topic to XLSX” button.\n\nGet Content Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n2. Organize Your Pillar Pages and Subtopics\n\nYour website will have multiple pillar pages. And every pillar page will have multiple subtopics.Use Semrush's Keyword Strategy Builder to organize everything. Here’s how:\n\nStart by entering one or more seed keywords representing your website’s core topics and click “Create list.”\n\nThe tool will then generate a list of pillar page topics and their potential subpages.\n\nYou can see a visual overview of all the pillar pages and topic clusters in the “Topical Overview” section at the top.\n\nIf you scroll down to the “Pages Details” section, you’ll see a list of pillar pages. Under each pillar page will be a list of subpages associated with it.\n\nFor each pillar page and subpage, you’ll be able to see:\n\nThe search intent associated with it\nThe keyword difficulty score\nThe search volume\nThe total number of associated keywords\n\nFrom here, you can select specific pillar pages and subpages you’d like to include in your content plan by clicking on the checkbox next to each page.\n\nAnd then click “Send keywords,” select \"Other keyword list,\" and click “Apply.”\n\nNext, from the drop-down box, select the keyword list to which you want to add the keywords. Or click on “Create new empty list” to create a new list.\n\nChoose whether you want to copy or move the keywords to the second list. Finally, click “Send keywords.”\n\nThen click “Go to all lists” at the top of the page to see all your keyword lists. \n\nClick on the one you’ve just created to review a list of all the keywords associated with your pillar pages and subpages.\n\nFrom here, you can export all the keywords by clicking the “Export” button.\n\nUse the list to start creating your pillar pages.\n\nSave and Organize Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Strategy Builder\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Create Your Content\n\nPillar posts are intended to holistically cover a topic and include internal links to cluster pages. Other than that, there isn’t a fixed set of rules to follow.\n\nHowever, most great pillar pages share the following traits:\n\nThey’re search engine optimized. Optimize your pillar page just like any other page. Check out this SEO writing guide to learn how.\nThey’re evergreen. Evergreen content stays “fresh” longer. You don’t need to update it every month, or possibly even every year, depending on the topic and how the content performs. \nThey’re easy to read. Pillar pages are content-heavy because they cover many aspects of a topic. Simplify navigation and amplify UX using elements like tables of contents, images, and bulleted lists.\nThey incorporate different types of content. Most pillar posts are text-based. But you can also include other formats, such as videos or infographics.\nThey include useful links. Pillar pages act as content hubs and often include many internal links. Only include relevant links with optimized anchor text. \nThey use relevant CTAs. Use compelling calls to action (CTAs) to encourage users to perform an action, such as creating an account or downloading an ebook. \n\nDive deeper in the content creation process to learn how to create the best topic clusters. \n\n3. Upload It to Your Site and Add Internal Links\n\nYou don’t have to create a custom design or make your pillar page look different from other pages on your site. Upload it like any other piece of content on your site. \n\nIf you haven’t done so already, add internal links.\n\nMake sure the pillar page contains links to all the cluster pages. And that all the cluster pages link to the pillar page.\n\nIdeally, you’ll want to use the primary keyword as the anchor text when linking to both the pillar page and the cluster pages. This will make it clear to search engines what each page is about.\n\nIf your cluster pages aren’t published and ready for internal links, you can publish your pillar post without them. \n\nAs you publish new cluster pages, edit your pillar post and add links to the recently created URLs.\n\nThis process is essential to building a logical website architecture. \n\nTypes of Pillar Pages (+ Examples)\n\nNot all pillar posts are created for the same purpose. Below, we explore different types of pillar posts. And pillar page examples to inspire you. \n\nRemember that the divisions between these categories are not absolute. Some pillar pages might have elements of each type.\n\n1. The Guide Pillar Page\n\nA guide pillar page is a comprehensive overview of a topic. It can be a 101 guide for beginners or an ultimate guide for advanced users, for example.\n\nThe following are good examples of guide pillar content:\n\nHunter’s Cold Email Guide\n\nHunter is an email outreach platform designed to help you find and connect with potential clients, business partners, and other people important to your business.\n\nHunter’s cold email guide is a great example of a pillar page that covers all the important aspects of a topic (in this case, cold email outreach).\n\nIt contains information on:\n\nCreating an outreach strategy\nBuilding a list of recipients\nOptimizing the technical aspects of email outreach\nWriting effective cold emails\nScheduling and sending campaigns\nAnalyzing the results of outreach campaigns\n\nThe above is everything you might need to get started with cold email outreach.

The What-Is Pillar Page\n\nUsers typically search for “What is + [topic]” when looking for information. A what-is pillar page responds to those search queries.\n\nNote\n\nIn many ways, a what-is pillar page is similar to a guide. Feel free to merge or tweak both types to craft your ideal content piece.\n\nBelow are two examples of solid what-is pillar pages:\n\nWhat Is Dropshipping and How Does It Work by Shopify\n\nFor an e-commerce platform like Shopify, talking about fulfillment models, such as dropshipping, makes a lot of sense. That’s why the company created a detailed pillar page on the topic.\n\nIt includes:\n\nWhat dropshipping is\nHow it works\nWho it’s for\nIts benefits and drawbacks\nFrequently asked questions\n\nAt the moment, this pillar page ranks for 1,600 keywords and drives an average of nearly 58,000 visits every month.\n\nWhat Is Artificial General Intelligence by Zapier\n\nZapier is a popular automation solution that integrates with thousands of apps.\n\nThe company is fully supportive of AI and has implemented several AI features into its platform. Along with this, they write about various AI topics on their blog. And one of their pillar pages provides an in-depth overview of artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nIt covers all the important aspects of the topic, including:\n\nWhat AGI is and how it works\nThe difference between AGI and artificial narrow intelligence (ANI)\nTypes of ANI, such as chatbots, large language models, and voice assistants\nAn estimate of when true AGI will be developed\n\nAs of this writing, this particular pillar page ranks for more than 140 keywords.\n\n3. The How-To Pillar Page\n\nHow-to pillar pages help your readers solve problems, often with step-by-step tutorials. \n\nSome examples of how-to pillar pages include the following:\n\nHow to Start an Online Store by Shopify\n\nAnother excellent pillar page from Shopify. This one details everything you need to know about opening an online store.\n\nIt includes information on:\n\nDeciding on a target audience\nFinding a business idea and choosing products\nChoosing an ecommerce platform\nDesigning a brand\nDetermining the business structure\nSetting up an ecommerce website\nLaunching and marketing an online store\n\nThe page ranks for 1,600 keywords and drives more than 18,000 organic visits every month.\n\nHow to Use LinkedIn for Business by Buffer\n\nBuffer offers social media management software that helps businesses manage their social media presence across a variety of platforms, including LinkedIn.\n\nOne of their pillar pages is an extensive guide to using LinkedIn for business, which covers topics such as:\n\nHow to create a company page on LinkedIn\nHow to optimize your LinkedIn presence\nHow to get more LinkedIn followers\nThe best types of content to post on LinkedIn\n\nThe page currently ranks for more than 250 keywords.\n\nCreate Stronger Pillar Pages\n\nPillar pages can become a foundation of your content strategy if you follow these tips to build them well. \n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder to create a keyword strategy for your website based around relevant pillar pages and topic clusters in minutes.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
