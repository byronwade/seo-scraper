Market Explorer\n\nSemrush’s Market Explorer tool lets you analyze your market. And helps you uncover crucial insights for your business.\n\nThink of the tool as a drone. It provides a bird's-eye view of the market landscape. \n\nWant to identify who's leading the pack in your market? No problem.\n\nWant to see the total size of your market? Easy. \n\nOr maybe you're looking for the best marketing channels? Yep, it can help with that, too!\n\nTo get started:\n\nOpen the tool\nSelect “Analyze Category”\nSelect your desired location \nChoose your market from the drop-down\nClick “Research a market”\n\nYou’ll see lots of valuable information. \n\nLook at:\n\nMarket Consolidation: This shows you how competitive your market is. A high consolidation means the market is dominated by a few big players. A low consolidation means that the market is more fragmented and diverse.\nMarket Domains: This shows the number of websites in your market\nMarket Traffic: Total traffic received by the websites in your market \nMarket Traffic Cost: The cost of generating paid traffic if you’re targeting the organic keywords your market’s players rank for\nMarket Size: This helps you evaluate the scalability of your market\nTotal Addressable Market (TAM) shows the total sales you can generate based on the demand for your product or service in a given market\nServiceable Available Market (SAM) shows the total sales you can generate based on the segment of the TAM that can afford and is ready to buy your product or service\n\nIn short, the “Market Summary” section helps you analyze your market and get a comprehensive overview of its competitiveness, traffic, cost, size, and sales potential.\n\nMoving on to the “Growth Quadrant” section, you’ll find your competitors classified into four types:\n\nGame Changers: Domains with low traffic but high growth—above the market average. Watch out for them.\nLeaders: Domains with high traffic and high growth—above the market average\nNiche Players: Sites with low market share and slow growth. They could be new or losing momentum.\nEstablished Players: Domains with high traffic but low growth. They are well-known and experienced in the industry.\n\nMarket Explorer helps you understand each competitor, learn from them, and strategize to outperform them.\n\nWhat’s more, it breaks down how much traffic each channel contributes to your market.\n\nTo help you prioritize channels for marketing.\n\nUnderstand where the majority of traffic flows from. Is it organic search, social media, paid ads, or direct visits? Then, adjust your marketing budget to leverage these channels.\n\nYou can also see the top five countries that produce the most traffic.\n\nThis gives you an idea about the global reach of your market and the opportunities for your business in different countries.\n\nThat’s not all.\n\nYou can also see the evolution of market traffic over time. This helps you assess whether your market is growing, declining, or staying the same.\n\nPricing: Market Explorer tool is part of Semrush’s suite of online marketing tools. The free version of the tool lends limited functionality.\n\nTo use Market Explorer to its full potential, subscribe to Semrush’s paid plan and the .Trends add-on.\n\nSemrush offers three paid plans: Pro, Guru, and Business.
