  "content": "What Is the Google Local Pack?\n\nThe Google local pack is a featured result in Google search that appears when a user makes a location-based search. \n\nTypically, Google’s local pack shows a map of business locations and three prominent business listings. Along with essential details for each business like the name, address, phone number, and customer ratings.\n\nHow Does the Google Local Pack Work?\n\nThe local pack shows a map and nearby business listings that are most likely to meet a user’s needs. So, it adjusts based on the user’s search query and location.\n\nLet’s say a user based in Raleigh, North Carolina is craving tacos but doesn’t know of any restaurants where they can get some.\n\nThey probably pull out their phone and Google “tacos near me” or “tacos in raleigh.” \n\nAt the top of the search engine results page (SERP), they’ll likely see a Google local pack that looks like this:\n\nIn addition to the map and business results, there’s also a “More places” link that expands the list of businesses. And filters for sorting by rating, price, and hours. \n\nIf they change their search terms, the results can also change. See this example of the search “tacos in north hills raleigh”:\n\nWhile some details about the featured businesses are already visible (like rating, number of reviews, and hours), a user can see even more information when they click on one of the results.\n\nThis includes the following: \n\nPictures\nMenu or services offered\nWebsite\nContact information\nAddress\nPopular times\nReviews\n\nNow, think of how likely that user is to go to one of the first businesses shown in the Google local pack. Probably pretty likely. \n\nThis is why the Google local pack is such a valuable resource for businesses and consumers alike. \n\nWhy Is the Google Local Pack Important for Local Businesses?\n\nThere are many reasons why the local pack is so effective for businesses. \n\nHere are a few of the big ones:\n\nIncreases Online Visibility\n\nThe Google local pack takes up a lot of space in the SERP. It’s hard to ignore. \n\nFrom a user’s perspective, why scroll down to the next result when everything you need is right there?\n\nThis means businesses can get more eyes on them just by appearing in the local pack. \n\nProvides a Good User Experience\n\nUsers can quickly see what they want to know about a business (hours, price range, rating, etc.) with just a glance at the local pack. Without needing to click to another page. \n\nThis cements the feature’s position as a go-to resource for users with local search intent. \n\nEncourages Users to Take Action \n\nThe local pack includes calls to action (CTAs) with options for ordering online, scheduling an appointment, calling the business, and more. \n\nThis encourages the user to take the next step in their buying journey with minimal effort. And that can easily drive real results for businesses.\n\nAttracts Foot Traffic\n\nAppearing in the local pack helps businesses attract more customers to their physical locations.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause local searches are usually performed by people who are based locally or traveling to that area. Meaning they’re eager to find businesses they plan to stop by.\n\nA ReviewTrackers’ Local SEO report found that 42% of millennials who perform a local search will visit the business most of the time.\n\nBuilds Credibility\n\nConsumers look for specific trust signals when making a buying decision. These include a business’s photos, Google SERP position, and user reviews. \n\nThe Google local pack heavily features user ratings and reviews. \n\nIf users clearly see that you have high ratings and positive remarks in the SERP, they’re more likely to give you their business.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Review Management to easily track reviews, respond to users, and analyze trends all in one place. \n\nMonitor Your Online Reviews\n\nwith the Review Management Tool\n\nGet Free Report →\nHow to Appear on Google’s Local Pack\n\nNow you know how important the Google local pack is for your business. But how do you secure one of those spots? \n\nFirst, know that the Google local pack algorithm is different from Google’s other search algorithms. \n\nIt emphasizes:\n\nRelevance: How closely your Google Business Profile matches a searcher’s query. Meaning whether you provide the product or service that Google believes the user is searching for. \nDistance: How far away your business is from where Google believes the user is located or from where the user’s target location is\nProminence: How important Google perceives your business to be in relation to the user\n\nLet’s go over some of the primary ways to address these factors. \n\nCreate Your Google Business Profile\n\nGoogle Business Profile (formerly known as Google My Business) is Google’s business listing manager. And you need to be verified here to show up in the Google local pack and Google Maps.\n\nFirst, claim your Google Business Profile or create a new one.\n\nTip\n\nIf you already have a Google Business Profile, skip ahead to the next section. \n\nYou can create a profile by going to Google Maps and clicking on the menu icon to the left of the search field.\n\nClick on “Add your business.”\n\nYou’ll be taken to a new browser window where you can start filling out your business details. \n\nFirst, enter your business name. And choose what type of business you run. \n\nNote\n\nThe process varies based on what type of business you select. The following examples are for a local store.\n\nThen, enter your business category. \n\nSpecifying your business category tells Google what type of business you run. So it can match you with relevant search queries. \n\nFor example, if someone searches “sushi restaurant” near you, your business is more likely to appear in the results if that’s your listed business category. \n\nOnce you follow the prompts to enter your address, Google may present a list of businesses that potentially match your address. If one of them is yours, exit the process and follow the steps to claim your business instead.\n\nIf your business isn’t listed, select the circle next to “This doesn’t match” and continue. \n\nNow, enter your contact details and opt into notifications if you wish.\n\nFinally, select a way to verify your business. \n\nCongratulations, now you have a Google Business Profile! \n\nBut that’s just the first step toward ranking in the Google local pack. \n\nYou can use numerous other local SEO tactics to rank higher with Google’s local search algorithm.\n\nWe’ll cover those next.\n\nTarget Local Keywords\n\nLocal keywords are keywords specific to the area you operate in or serve. So, they can be highly effective for gaining local website and foot traffic.\n\nThey’re usually a combination of a regular keyword (something related to your industry) and a location. And sometimes have a modifier like “best” or “top.”\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to uncover relevant keywords for your industry and area.\n\nJust enter a keyword that encompasses both your niche and your location (state, city, neighborhood, etc.). And click “Search.” \n\nThis will generate a list of similar keywords, sorted by their average monthly search volumes—which is the average number of times the term is searched each month. \n\nReview this list to find options that are particularly relevant to your business. \n\nThen, create blog posts, landing pages, and other types of content that incorporate these terms.\n\nGet Local Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nGet NAP Citations on Directories and Social Media \n\nYou can add name, address, and phone number (NAP) citations to many social media profiles and business directories. \n\nHere’s an example of a NAP citation on Yelp:\n\nThese citations are important for local SEO. Because Google often uses them to verify your basic business information. \n\nTo find out where you’re cited online, use the Listing Management tool. \n\nFirst, search your business and choose the one that matches your name and address. \n\nThis will generate a report of your business’s local visibility. Including where you’re listed. And where you’re not. \n\nScroll down, and you’ll see ways your visibility can be improved. Like by updating your business details or contact information. \n\nYou can manually update or add your business information to each directory. Or use the Listing Management tool to automatically update your information across major online platforms.\n\nIncrease Your Local Visibility\n\nwith the Listing Management Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nBuild Backlinks from Other Local Businesses\n\nLink building is the process of getting links to your website from other sites. \n\nThese links help you build authority with Google. Especially when the links are from websites relevant to your industry and community. \n\nThere are tons of ways to earn backlinks. For example, you can create linkable resources (like how-to guides, instructional videos, and infographics). Or ask other sites in your niche to link to that content.\n\nNot only can these links affect how Google views your site, but they can also help you get discovered by local audiences. \n\nFurther reading: How to Get Backlinks: 10 Strategies That Work\n\nEncourage and Respond to Reviews\n\nReviews play a huge role in how both search engines and people view your business. And the best way to get more is to ask for reviews. \n\nHere are some tips for asking customers to leave your reviews:\n\nRequest feedback immediately after the customer has made a purchase or once you’ve completed a service\nIf the customer doesn’t seem happy, try to amend the problem directly to prevent negative reviews and save their experience with your business \nBe appreciative. For example, thank them for choosing your business when you make a review request. Then, send them a follow-up message after they’ve left a review.\nCustomize the request using the customer’s name and details of their purchase\nMake it easy by providing a Google Reviews link\n\nBut the work doesn’t stop once you’ve encouraged a customer to share their feedback. You also need to monitor and respond to reviews to improve the customer experience. \n\nTo easily manage reviews, go to Semrush’s Review Management tool and search for your business. \n\nOnce the report is ready, you can see real-time data on your business’s average star rating and number of reviews. \n\nNext, select “Manage reviews now” to sign up for a plan that gives you access to Semrush Local. \n\nFrom there, go to the “Review Management” tab and scroll down to see individual reviews.\n\nYou can respond to a Google review directly in the tool. \n\nTo craft your own response, click “Reply” next to the review. Or, click “Generate draft” for an AI-generated response. \n\nYou’ll get progress reports from Review Management on how your online reputation stacks up against competitors. And suggestions for improving your reputation. \n\nMonitor Your Local SEO Performance\n\nTracking your performance for local keyword rankings and local pack appearances is the best way to see what’s working and what can be improved. \n\nStart by opening the Position Tracking tool. \n\nEnter your domain and click “Set up tracking.” \n\nName your project if you wish and click “Create project.”\n\nNow, configure your settings. And when you’re done, click “Continue To Keywords.”\n\nYou can manually enter the keywords you want to track or import them from a TXT file, a CSV file, Google Analytics, or another campaign. Or, import a list of Semrush-suggested keywords. \n\nWhen you’re done, click “Start Tracking.”\n\nOnce your report is generated, scroll down to “SERP Features.” \n\nFind the map pin icon labeled “Local pack” and click it. \n\nThis will show an overview of your average rankings for the local keywords you’re targeting. And whether you appear in Google’s local pack for them.\n\nUse these reports to keep your finger on the pulse of your local SEO efforts. \n\nThen, make adjustments over time to achieve better results. \n\nImprove Your Local Visibility \n\nAs you’re devising your Google local pack strategy, remember to focus on the user experience. \n\nWhen in doubt, think about what you want to see when looking for a local business. Chances are, your customers want the same things. \n\nUsing Review Management makes it easy to put customers first.
