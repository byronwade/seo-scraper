  "title": "20 Types of Marketing to Grow Your Business in 2024",
  "content": "Businesses use marketing to promote their products, services, or brand. You can have diverse marketing objectives, from growing an audience to driving sales. But not all marketing channels work well for every business.\n\nBelow, we’ll go through 20 of the most useful types of marketing for both B2B and B2C businesses. We’ll also cover examples and best practices for each one.\n\n1. Search Engine Marketing\n\nSearch engine marketing (SEM) is a digital marketing strategy to increase your site's visibility on search engine results pages (SERPs). It involves both search engine optimization (SEO) and paid advertising.\n\nYou can optimize your webpages to rank organically (for free) for keywords your target audience is searching for. And you can also buy ads that show up for those keywords in the SERPs. \n\nThere are many pay-per-click (PPC) platforms, including search engines and social media sites. But the one most relevant to SEM is Google Ads. These ads can appear throughout SERPs, and often at the top of the first page. \n\nThe screenshot below shows two types of PPC ads on a Google SERP. The first is a carousel of shopping ads. The second is a standard paid search ad.\n\nWhile SEO can involve investment, you don’t need to pay to rank in the same way as with paid ads. But you do need to optimize your pages for users and search engines. And create high-quality content.\n\nThe first stage of any successful SEO or paid advertising campaign is typically finding keywords that match what your potential customers are searching for. So that your content can appear in front of them. \n\nHow to Find Keywords for SEO Campaigns\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to find keywords to target with your SEO campaigns. \n\nTo start, enter a broad keyword related to your business and choose a target location. Then click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will generate a list of related terms. But the best keywords have high search volume and low keyword difficulty.\n\nTo find them, click the “KD %” filter and select a custom range of 0-49. Then click “Apply.” This will show only keywords that are “Possible” or easier to rank for.\n\nYour keyword list is automatically sorted by volume from highest to lowest. So the resulting list contains keywords that match our high volume/low difficulty criteria.\n\nFor example, if you sold customized bullet journals, there are a few keywords in the list above that you could target.\n\nYou could create a listicle of great “bullet journal ideas.” Or perhaps a shareable resource of “bullet journal templates.”\n\nOr you could optimize your “habit tracker bullet journal” product pages for better visibility in search results.\n\nFind Keywords for Your SEO Campaigns\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Find Keywords for Paid Advertising Campaigns\n\nIf you’re also using paid ads as part of your search engine marketing campaign, use Semrush’s Advertising Research tool to find keywords based on your competitors’ ad strategies. To see what’s working for them and how you can learn from it.\n\nTo get started, enter your competitor’s URL and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see an overview of their traffic, estimated ad costs, and the number of paid keywords their ads appear for.\n\nThis can give you an idea of the kind of money your competitors are spending on Google Ads. But to see the keywords they’re targeting, scroll down to the “Paid Search Positions” widget.\n\nYou’ll see each keyword their ads appear for. Along with metrics for each one, like search volume, the estimated traffic each one drives to their site, and how much it costs per click. You can even see the total cost of each keyword, and what percentage of their total traffic costs that corresponds to.\n\nWhen choosing paid keywords you might want to target with your own SEM campaigns, consider the search volume, CPC, and competitive density (the “Com.” column above) in particular. \n\nYou ideally want to target keywords with high search volume, low cost per click, and low competitive density. To maximize your paid ads budget.\n\nSearch Engine Marketing Best Practices\nCombine organic and paid search engine marketing to optimize for both short and long-term results \nUse tools like Keyword Magic and Advertising Research to ensure you’re targeting the right keywords with SEM campaigns\nUse SEM alongside other marketing types to target customers on various platforms\n2. Social Media Marketing\n\nSocial media marketing is a digital marketing tactic that involves using social media platforms to connect and engage with a target audience.\n\nLike search engine marketing, social media marketing consists of paid and organic strategies. And many social media sites have built-in PPC platforms. \n\nThis example from Wendy’s shows social media marketing inventiveness. The brand’s feed is full of witty jokes and sassy commentary that delights followers.\n\nThis helps Wendy’s get engagement on posts (likes, comments etc.) which can boost brand awareness. Without having to pay to post.\n\nBut you can also run ads on social media platforms. This can help increase your reach and put targeted ads in front of potential customers. \n\nHere’s an example from Dose Daily, a drinkable supplement company. The brand uses engaging product videos and images to capture Instagram users’ attention:\n\nSemrush Social lets you manage and analyze your social media performance, schedule posts, and manage your community. All in one place.\n\nOnce you connect your accounts, you’ll have access to a few key tools.\n\nIn the Social Poster, you can schedule posts days, weeks, or even months in advance. You can schedule posts to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, and Pinterest. \n\nYou can then monitor your social profiles’ performance in the Social Tracker. Which shows your top content by channel, an overview of engagement levels, and even comparisons with your competitors.\n\nGet a deeper understanding of your engagement metrics with Social Content Insights. These can quickly show you which content is performing well. And which content is not. So you can continuously adapt your social media marketing strategy accordingly.\n\nYou can even respond to messages across multiple platforms without leaving the tool through Social Inbox. Making it easy to keep up with incoming messages and manage your reputation.\n\nAccess all of these tools and more with Semrush Social. To make it easy to manage, analyze, and improve your social media marketing strategy.\n\nSocial Media Marketing Best Practices\nChoose your platforms carefully based on your audience’s preferences and behavior\nConsider combining paid and organic social media marketing strategies\nPrioritize content that solves an audience problem or entertains them rather than promotional content\n\nStreamline Your Social Media Management\n\nwith a Semrush Social Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\n3. Content Marketing\n\nContent marketing is the creation and distribution of content to grow, engage, and maintain your audience. A successful content marketing strategy helps you achieve your business’s goals through high-quality content that converts readers into customers.\n\nYou can use diverse types of content in content marketing campaigns, including:\n\nBlog posts\nNewsletters\nSocial media posts\nEbooks\nWhitepapers\n\nSpotify’s annual “Wrapped” campaign is an excellent example of content marketing. It gives customers an analytical view of their music tastes from the past year. \n\nThis engages current users with personalized content. And encourages them to share their “Wrapped” result with their friends and family. Boosting the campaign’s reach and attracting new customers.\n\nUse Semrush’s Topic Research tool to generate content ideas for your own brand.\n\nJust enter your topics of choice and click “Get content ideas.”\n\nYou’ll then see a selection of topic cards. Clicking “Show more” under one of them will show you more ideas.\n\nYou’ll then see lists of related headlines, questions, and searches. Along with metrics about the overall subtopic volume and difficulty.\n\nGoing back to our example of someone selling bullet journals, there are a few opportunities here, such as:\n\nAn interactive quiz on what people use their bullet journals for \nBlog posts to help people start and finish their bullet journals\nPDF templates on what to include in a bullet journal\n\nYou could then create this content on your chosen platforms (like a blog or on social media). To drive engagement with your audience and inform them about how your products can help solve their problems.\n\nContent Marketing Best Practices\nTry out different types of content to see what works best with your audience\nUse content marketing as part of a multi-channel campaign, especially for driving brand awareness\nLeverage tools like Topic Research to quickly come up with lots of content ideas\n4. Email Marketing\n\nEmail marketing is a direct marketing channel that allows you to connect with customers one-on-one.\n\nYou can use email marketing for various purposes within your wider strategy, including:\n\nWelcoming new customers to your business\nTelling existing customers about new products or promotions to drive conversions\nGetting feedback from customers to improve your products or services\nSales emails to directly pitch products or services to potential customers or clients\n\nElectronics giant Bose's Black Friday email highlights a single product. It includes a prominent customer review. And details about the “huge savings” to encourage recipients to buy.\n\nEmail Marketing Best Practices\nAim to capture your audience’s email addresses through CTAs on your website\nSegment your audience to facilitate better email personalization and increase engagement\nTry different types of email campaigns, like newsletters and promotional offers, to see what drives the most engagement and conversions\n5. Influencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing is the collaboration between businesses and individuals (influencers) who have a large social media following. \n\nCommon examples of influencers include celebrities, athletes, and digital content creators. Businesses will then compensate these influencers to promote their products or services. \n\nFor example, the social media post below shows influencer Ellen Brock promoting Purina cat food, along with a discount code that likely earns her some form of commission when people make purchases with it:\n\nInfluencer marketing can be a useful way to reach a wider audience. One that already trusts the influencer you want to work with.\n\nBut it doesn’t suit every business model. And it can be expensive. So you need to choose the influencers you want to work with based on your industry, goals, and values.\n\nInfluencer Marketing Best Practices\nResearch influencers in your industry to find individuals who fit with your brand\nChoose a clear objective, like brand awareness or revenue growth\nBuild strong relationships with influencers by listening to their feedback and giving them creative license to suit their audience\n6. Public Relations\n\nBusinesses use public relations to maintain a favorable public image. They pitch the press for news coverage, podcast or video appearances, and speaking opportunities. \n\nHere’s an example of a press release put out by Taboola, a recommendation engine for publishers, announcing a new partnership:\n\nPress releases are a great tool to send to reporters, who then may cover the story if they feel it’s relevant for their audience.\n\nPublic Relations Best Practices\nMaintain strong relationships with journalists and content creators from related industry publications, podcasts, and news channels \nAlways be authentic and honest. Only pitch when you have something valuable to offer.\nKeep your brand narrative and storytelling consistent\n\nFurther reading: A Guide to Digital PR & Why It Matters\n\n7. Affiliate Marketing\n\nAffiliate marketing is a type of digital marketing where companies offer compensation to merchants selling products on their behalf. These merchants are known as affiliates. \n\nAffiliate marketing shares some similarities with influencer marketing. But while influencer marketing campaigns are often tailored to that specific influencer and their audience, businesses with affiliate programs may have hundreds or thousands of affiliates promoting their products. Without having much of a formal relationship with them.\n\nFor example, the online education platform MasterClass has an affiliate program. The New York Post reviewed its education platform, and would earn commission if readers signed up through its links.\n\nA call to action (CTA) prompts readers to sign up for MasterClass. Clicking the link leads you to a MasterClass landing page with a unique tracking code that tells MasterClass when the New York Post makes a sale. So that the New York Post can be compensated.\n\nAffiliate Marketing Best Practices\nLook for affiliates who can access your target audience, like blog owners or YouTubers with relevant channels\nCreate a clear commission structure, such as paying affiliates a flat fee or a percentage based on the number of sales they’ve generated for you over time\nWork with a platform like ShareASale or Awin to keep track of payments\n8. Video Marketing\n\nWith video marketing, you create videos that promote or provide information about your products or services. These can be long-form (like YouTube tutorials on using the product) or short-form (like TikTok clips highlighting key features).\n\nWhen asked about content format types, 45% of people said video content performed best. And 82% of respondents have been convinced to buy a product or service by watching a video.\n\nPut your own video marketing strategy into action by starting with basic keyword research. To find out what people are searching for on the platforms where you’ll create your videos. \n\nUse Keyword Analytics for YouTube if you plan on creating content for the platform. Whether that be long-form or short-form.\n\nGo to the tool and click “Get started” under “Keywords Research.”\n\nThe next screen will show you the past month’s top YouTube keywords in your location. \n\nEnter a term related to your niche in the search bar to find relevant keywords. \n\nUse these ideas as a starting point for your video marketing campaigns. Ideally targeting keywords with high search volume and low competitive rate. \n\nClick any of the terms to see more related keywords you may want to target.\n\nYou’ll find Keyword Analytics for YouTube in the Semrush App Center.\n\nVideo Marketing Best Practices\nTry out both short- and long-form video content across various platforms\nUse video content as part of your social media marketing strategy to boost engagement and reach a wider audience\nTreat YouTube as a search engine and apply SEO techniques to increase your organic visibility on the platform\n9. Print Advertising\n\nPrint advertising is a traditional marketing tactic that involves buying advertisements in printed/physical materials. It includes brochures, magazine ads, flyers, billboard ads, and more.\n\nIt’s one of the oldest forms of marketing, but brands still use it today. For example, Times Square in New York is full of both print and digital billboards.\n\nAs with many types of offline marketing, print marketing’s impact is difficult to measure. So, it’s often used in brand awareness campaigns or when targeting local audiences. Like this MotoX magazine ad:\n\nUnlike many digital marketing tactics, where you can tie website visits and conversions directly to your marketing efforts, print marketing doesn’t inherently provide a way of tracking these metrics. So it can get very expensive very quickly.\n\nPrint Advertising Best Practices\nUse print marketing as part of your wider strategy, as it often doesn’t have high conversion rates on its own due to its broad targeting\nUse billboards and other out-of-home advertising placements to spread brand awareness at scale \nSet a budget and stick to it, as print advertising costs can quickly rise as you dial in your targeting\n10. Direct Mail\n\nDirect mail involves sending brochures, postcards, and other physical mail to your potential customers to generate business. It’s a specific subtype of print marketing.\n\nAn example of direct mail marketing comes from Oriflame. It sent personalized samples of its skincare products via mail.\n\nFree samples can be a great way to delight potential customers while letting them try before they buy. This can build trust in your brand. \n\nHowever, deploying a direct mail marketing campaign requires extensive input. You must collect contact information, segment your audience, and create tailored messaging for each segment. So, like print marketing in general, it can get quite expensive.\n\nDirect Mail Best Practices\nUse bold colors or textured papers for flyers and postcards so they stand out\nAim to delight your customers with personalized messaging\nUse QR codes to encourage potential customers to interact with your brand digitally, which can help you track your efforts\n11. Broadcast Marketing\n\nBroadcast marketing is a traditional marketing tactic where companies run television or radio ads. Typically, companies purchase a block of time to play their pre-recorded audio or video commercials. \n\nTV and radio ad placements are often expensive. At the extreme end of the scale, a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl can cost as much as $7 million. And that’s not counting the production costs.\n\nThey’re also difficult to target at a narrow audience. And it’s hard to track their performance.\n\nThis makes TV advertising in particular more accessible for bigger companies than small brands. But broadcast marketing can still be an effective way to get eyes or ears on your products as part of a brand awareness campaign.\n\nBroadcast Marketing Best Practices\nResearch your target audience to ensure your ads air on the right platforms at the right times\nFactor in all expenses when budgeting your broadcast marketing ads, from production costs to the price of the ad slot\nUse broadcast marketing as part of a wider marketing strategy, as they’re best for brand awareness rather than highly targeted campaigns \n12. Telemarketing\n\nTelemarketing is a type of traditional marketing where a salesperson calls a potential customer over the phone to encourage a sale. \n\nThis type of marketing comes in various forms. And for various stages of the buying cycle. For example:\n\nCold calling: Reaching out to prospects in an attempt to generate business. This generally has low conversion rates and is often seen as intrusive.\nInbound calls: These are usually calls to individuals who have submitted their contact information and shown interest in your business. These may convert better than cold calls, but it may still be seen as an intrusive form of marketing.\nSales calls: These are typically calls to potential or existing customers that have shown interest in what you offer. These require skilled salespeople to convert leads into customers over the phone.\n\nTelemarketing is often done at scale with call centers. But small businesses can use telemarketing as well. As it can allow you to build a relationship with potential customers compared to email when done right. But when executed poorly, it can frustrate them instead.\n\nTelemarketing Best Practices\nDon’t try to sell right away, and focus on the customer’s needs \nOffer to call back if it’s not a good time\nFocus your telemarketing efforts on leads that have shown strong interest in your products or services \n13. Event Marketing\n\nEvent marketing is a traditional marketing tactic where businesses use events to attract attention to a brand, product, or service. These events are typically held in person, but online events are common and can work well too.\n\nThe key aim of event marketing is to create a memorable brand experience. Businesses can host events, attend trade shows as exhibitors or speakers, or sponsor events for exposure.\n\nThe Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) uses this type of marketing. Its website has a dedicated events page for upcoming webinars and conferences:\n\nEvent marketing can work well for brands looking to increase awareness or reach a specific audience directly. Putting on a popular and exciting event can build hype around your brand. And generate leads too.\n\nEvent Marketing Best Practices\nThink about whether hosting, attending, or speaking at events suits your objectives\nTrial both online and in-person events to see which one works best \nAim to create memorable, valuable experiences\n14. Acquisition marketing\n\nAcquisition marketing is the process of moving customers through the marketing funnel. It covers the process of creating awareness, attracting leads, nurturing them, and converting them to customers. \n\nAcquisition marketing is therefore a catch-all term for many different types of marketing employed as a wider strategy. \n\nLet’s walk through an example campaign from Merry Maids, a national cleaning service with local branches throughout the US.\n\nIf you search for “spring cleaning tips” on Google, you’ll find a blog article on the Merry Maids website. This helps generate awareness of the brand and its services.\n\nAt the end of the blog article is information about the brand’s cleaning services. And a call to action to get a free quote.\n\nFrom there, the article prompts you to fill out a form on a landing page. You then become a lead that Merry Maids can reach out to and attempt to convert into a customer.\n\nAcquisition Marketing Best Practices\nTrack important marketing key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure performance across your marketing efforts\nFrequently test different content formats and campaign tactics\nAdjust your strategy continuously based on the data you gather in these tests\n15. Inbound marketing\n\nInbound marketing is a type of digital marketing that attracts customers through tailored content or experiences. It’s also known as “pull” marketing because it attracts your audience.\n\nInbound marketing relies on audience targeting. It identifies people who meet your ideal customer profile and reaches them with tailored messaging across various channels. \n\nThe EarlyBird blog is an example of inbound marketing. It contains articles covering topics for families who want to invest for their children early.\n\nThis inbound strategy “pulls” searchers to the website. As the articles may appear in search results. After receiving value from the article, readers may feel compelled to choose that brand for their needs. And convert into customers.\n\nInbound Marketing Best Practices\nGet to know your ideal customer through market research\nUse audience targeting to your advantage to maximize content relevance and ROI\nCreate multi-channel campaigns to attract, engage, and delight your audience\n\nElevate Your Inbound Marketing Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\n16. Outbound marketing\n\nOutbound marketing involves proactively reaching out to potential customers. \n\nThis marketing style is interruptive. You’re targeting an audience not necessarily looking for a product or solution. Unlike the “pull” nature of inbound marketing, you’re “pushing” your brand toward potential customers.\n\nYour goal is to generate interest among potential buyers. So you’re casting a wide net to gain new customers.\n\nSuper Bowl ads are an example of outbound marketing. Every ad reaches a vast, demographically diverse audience. This offers great brand visibility but comes at the cost of relevance. And, as we mentioned earlier, this type of traditional marketing can be very expensive.\n\nHere’s an example of Squarespace’s Super Bowl ad from 2023:\n\nThe ad is fairly straightforward, showing off Squarespace as a “website that makes websites.” It also features a famous face (Adam Driver), and a unique overall approach. An important trait of any TV commercial where capturing the audience’s attention is key. \n\nOutbound Marketing Best Practices\nFocus on reaching the highest number of relevant customers while staying within your budget \nUse simple messaging to ensure your audience understands your offering\nProvide a clear next step for your audience to follow to make it easy for them to convert\n17. Word of Mouth Marketing\n\nWord-of-mouth marketing is a traditional type of marketing that encourages happy customers to recommend your products or services. \n\nA 2022 Nielsen study backed up the potential value of word-of-mouth marketing strategies. Finding that 89% of people trust personal recommendations more than any other channel.\n\nCompanies can encourage word-of-mouth marketing in many ways. Loyalty programs and product referral campaigns are marketing activities designed to foster conversation about the brand.\n\nFor example, Meal-kit service Hello Fresh encourages word-of-mouth marketing by offering referral discounts. Existing customers can send “freebies” to friends to try the service at no charge. Or they can share a referral code that rewards both parties with a discount. \n\nWord-of-Mouth Marketing Best Practices\nChoose appropriate KPIs for measuring the success of word-of-mouth marketing, like referral code entries at checkout \nEncourage your customers to share your brand with their friends and family through friendly messaging\nConsider creating a loyalty program that encourages customers to refer others in exchange for a discount or free item\n\nFurther reading: Word of Mouth Marketing Statistics\n\n18. Relationship Marketing \n\nRelationship marketing is a type of marketing that’s designed to foster long-term relationships with customers. As opposed to just driving short-term results.\n\nFor example, Capital One knows its customers hate waiting in line at the airport. So, it reimburses card holders up to $100 when they pay the TSA PreCheck fee with their Capital One travel card.\n\nRelationship Marketing Best Practices\nFocus on what keeps your customers happy to encourage loyalty\nOffer solutions to problems your customers have to show them you care about your relationship with them\nMeasure customer satisfaction and retention to determine your effectiveness\n19. Brand Marketing \n\nBrand marketing combines traditional and digital marketing tactics to build brand awareness and affinity with your target audience. It improves brand reputation, which can result in more loyal customers. It’s often rolled out as part of a multi-channel strategy. \n\nBrand marketing places the brand in front of a bigger audience and establishes itself as an authority. \n\nThe Michelin Guide is a good example of brand marketing. Although the project has almost nothing to do with Michelin’s key products (tires), it increased brand awareness and relevance.\n\nThe guide is a well-known standard for distinguishing top-tier restaurants. It also has the bonus effect of associating Michelin’s name with quality and luxury.\n\nBrand Marketing Best Practices\nThink outside of the box to promote your brand in creative ways that get attention\nUse a mix of other marketing types within your overall brand marketing strategy\nKeep your brand positioning and messaging consistent across all marketing channels\n20. Product Marketing\n\nProduct marketing leverages a product as its own narrative. It can be as simple as focusing marketing campaigns on the product's benefits or features. You can also offer free trials or tiered pricing models and let the product market itself.\n\nIt’s a popular approach with SaaS businesses. These companies operate in competitive markets where slight differences in product positioning and pricing can create a sizeable competitive edge. \n\nTrello, for example, offers a free platform with various price tiers and a free trial of its paid plans to let users try the product before committing.\n\nProduct Marketing Best Practices\nIt often works well to keep your product marketing efforts simple, letting the product sell itself\nUse free trials or a freemium pricing model to let your customers try before they buy\nUse product-related creatives across all your marketing channels\nChoose a Mix of Marketing Types to Create Your Perfect Campaign\n\nFocusing on one type of marketing can generate results. But often a combination of marketing types provides the best return on your investment. As you can target a more specific audience at different stages of the buying funnel.\n\nLike a solid content marketing strategy to drive traffic to your blog along with an email marketing campaign to turn those visitors into customers. Or combining your own video marketing campaigns with influencer or social media marketing for greater reach.\n\nSemrush offers several tools to help you get the most out of whichever types of marketing you use for your business. These tools help you research, run, and measure your SEO, content, social, influencer, and digital advertising campaigns.
