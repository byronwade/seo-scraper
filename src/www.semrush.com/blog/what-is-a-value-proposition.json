  "content": "What Is a Value Proposition? \n\nA value proposition is a statement that details why customers should buy your product or service.\n\nIn a sentence or two, it conveys:\n\nYour brand’s key features and benefits \nHow you differ from competitors \nHow you’ll solve customers’ problems\n\nIt’s like saying “Here’s what our company does and why we’re perfect for you.”\n\nHere’s a value proposition for Semrush:\n\nGet measurable results from online marketing. Do SEO, content marketing, competitor research, PPC and social media marketing from just one platform.\n\nWe explain what our target customers gain from using our platform. And how we stand out from similar options (all-in-one platform). \n\nThat’s communicating value. \n\nYou’ll see value propositions on websites and in ads. But companies also use them to create consistent messaging internally. And for investor pitches. \n\nValue propositions differ from mission statements (longer statements thatdefine a company's goals) and slogans (catchy phrases that capture the spirit of the brand). \n\nUse the Value Proposition writing tool in our AI Writing Assistant to capture your brand’s value in seconds. \n\nWhy Is It Important to Have a Value Proposition? \n\nIf people don’t know what your product or service can do for them, they won’t buy it. \n\nYour brand could be the best in the market. But if you don’t communicate its value, it may as well not exist.\n\nA unique value proposition directly connects your offering to your target customers’ needs.So your message genuinely resonates. \n\nIt helps you: \n\nAttract the right kind of customers who are ready to purchase\nConnect with your audience to build long-term loyalty\nGuide your marketing, sales, and product development \n\nIn short, your value proposition is the foundation of your entire marketing plan.\n\nElements of a Value Proposition \n\nValue propositions typically contain three components:\n\nHeadline: Your core message that conveys the value you offer. It should be attention-grabbing but accurate.\nSubheadline: Additional context that clarifies your offering, provides secondary details, or an additional message\nVisual: An image, graphic, or video that reinforces the value proposition and makes it more engaging\n\nValue propositions come in different forms depending on how they’re being used. What you see on a landing page may differ from a pitch deck.\n\nBut the above elements remain the foundation of crafting a good one. \n\nHow to Create a Strong Value Proposition \n\nTo write a compelling value proposition, you must thoroughly know both your brand and audience. \n\nWith that information, you can craft a strong value proposition in seconds with our AI Writing Assistant.\n\nIf you’re still learning about your audience and identifying your unique selling points, continue reading. \n\n1. Identify Your Target Audience\n\nYour target audience is your ideal client. \n\nFor example, an ecommerce store is trying to sell computer backpacks. \n\nIts ideal client could be young professionals who prioritize tech-friendly features like padded laptop compartments and device charging ports. \n\nOr older clients, who place more value on ergonomic touches like padded shoulder straps. \n\nOr even higher-income individuals who may want brand prestige and cutting-edge materials. Lower-income individuals are likely looking for durability and versatility.\n\nBy analyzing your potential clients’ needs, pain points, and preferences, you can create a message that truly speaks to them. And persuades them to purchase. \n\nConduct crucial audience research by analyzing your competitors’ audiences. Semrush’s One2Target tool makes this step easy and efficient.\n\nTo start, select your location and enter up to five of your competitors’ domains. Click “Analyze.” \n\nUnder Demographics, you’ll see a competitor audience breakdown by age, sex, and location. Plus, the number of visitors to their site.\n\nSocioeconomics details household size, income level, and employment status.\n\nFor deeper insights, go to Behavior to see audience interests and preferred social media channels. Or Audience Overlap to see other websites they visit.\n\nUse these insights to understand who your customers are and what they want in a product or service like yours.\n\n2. Analyze What You Offer\n\nStart by listing all the key benefits of your offering. Then, include the things your company does well for its customers.\n\nFor example:\n\nWhat features do you offer that are unique in the market?\nWhat innovative technology have you leveraged? \nHow easy is it for customers to buy?\nWhat makes customers feel most satisfied with their purchase?\nWhat positive experiences have you created for your customers?\nHow does your pricing compare to competitors?\nWhat ethical or sustainability practices do you follow? \nHow have you built a community around your brand?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn what customers truly appreciate about you. \n\nHead to Semrush's Brand Monitoring tool to review customer feedback and see how you’re perceived in the market.\n\nThis tool allows you to track brand mentions across the web and social media platforms.\n\nClick “Get Started.” Then, select what you’d like to monitor. For example, to see how popular your brand is and what people think about it, select “Brand.”\n\nEnter your brand name and whether you want to receive email notifications for new mentions. Additional drop-downs offer advanced search filters. When you’re done, click “Create query.” \n\nShortly, you’ll see a report overview. Under “Analytics,” review total mentions and where they’re from. Below that, sentiment toward your brand.\n\nFor deeper insights, toggle to “Mentions.”You’ll see a list of times you’ve come up that can be sorted by language, location, sentiment, or keywords. \n\nLeverage these insights by looking for mentions with positive sentiment. And use them to answer the above questions. \n\nStreamline Audience Research\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\n3. Connect Benefits to Customers’ Needs with a Value Proposition Template\n\nYou identified your customers’ main problems. And found what makes your brand special.\n\nNow, put them together. \n\nUsing our commuter backpack example. Perhaps you discovered that your audience is primarily young urban professionals who appreciate tech-friendly features.\n\nAnd you saw that existing customers spoke highly of the backpack’s layout. Such as how they can access the laptop from either the top or the side of the bag.\n\nThis is a key part of your value.\n\nBut how do you make the connection in a way that speaks to people?\n\nTry using one of the below templates to get started. \n\nGeoffrey Moore’s Value Positioning Statement\n\nFirst introduced in his book, Crossing the Chasm, Geoffrey Moore’s Value Positioning Statement has been used by numerous Fortune 500 Companies. \n\nFor [target customer] who [problem they need solved], [your product or service] is a [product category] that [explain the main benefit]\n\nUsing our example brand:\n\nFor city dwellers who need a stylish way to carry their tech essentials, ABCPack is a cutting-edge daily carry system with a multi-access laptop compartment and integrated RFID-blocking pockets.\n\nSteve Blank’s XYZ Statement\n\nFor something shorter, try entrepreneur Steve Blank’s formula. Tech startups often use a format similar to this. \n\nIt’s simply:\n\nWe help X do Y by doing Z.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe help urban commuters stay organized and connected by providing tech-friendly backpacks with advanced storage and security features. \n\nValue Proposition Canvas\n\nThe Value Proposition Canvas is a detailed framework that’s often taught in business programs.\n\nUsing the chart below, map your customer needs and pain points by connecting them to your product or services.\n\nThe canvas is divided into two main sections: the customer profile and the value map. \n\nStart by completing the Customer profile: \n\nJobs: Tasks customers want to complete, feelings they want to experience, or emotional responses from others they want to elicit\nPains: Obstacles, anxieties, and frustrations they experience completing the job\nGains: Positive outcomes from completing the job, such as results or aspirations \n\nThen fill in the Value Map: \n\nProducts and services: Products or services that you offer\nPain relievers: How they reduce or fix the pains customers have\nGain creators: Ways they produce the outcomes that customers want\n\nMatch the solutions on the Value Map to the problems on the Customer Profile. Now you have the basis for your value proposition statement.\n\nLike this:\n\n4. Write Your Value Proposition \n\nTone, word choice, and syntax are all equally important for value proposition writing.\n\nHere are some tips for nailing it:\n\nMake sure your value proposition can be read and understood in five seconds\nUse simple language \nUse active voice \nUse words like “you” and your” for personalization \nUse a consistent tone\nAvoid hype and superlatives (“best ever!”)\nAvoid jargon\nAvoid clichés\n\nGet a head start using Semrush's AI Writing Assistant, which uses the latest AI technology to generate a value proposition in seconds based on your inputs.\n\nGo to All Tools and type in “value proposition.” (There are 70-plus tools to choose from.)\n\nOpen the tool and use the product and audience information you’ve gathered to input your preferences. \n\nFor the product description, detail matters. So the AI can deliver a customized output. \n\nThen, click “Generate.” \n\nCopy the results and edit them to your specifications. Or use it right out of the box.\n\nThe tool can also create social media posts, emails, ad copy, and a lot more.\n\nCraft Your Value Proposition in Seconds\n\nwith the AI Writing Assistant\n\nSign Up Now →\n5. Test Your Value Proposition \n\nTo see if your value resonates with your target audience, A/B test it.\n\nCreate two different versions and present each version to a segment of your audience.\n\nUsing channels like your:\n\nHomepage\nProduct pages\nEmail campaigns \nPaid ad copy\nSocial media posts \n\nLook at metrics like engagement, conversion rates, and feedback. To see which performs better.\n\nThen, refine your value proposition based on these insights. Repeat the process until you find the most effective version.\n\n6 Value Proposition Examples to Learn From\n\nA company’s exact value proposition is often part of its internal documents and not shared with the public. But a version of it commonly appears on website homepages.\n\nHere are some examples and what you can learn from them.\n\n1. Netflix\n\nNetflix successfully distills the main benefit of streaming: to watch as many movies and TV shows as you want, any time. \n\nThis value proposition also preemptively addresses customers’ concerns about getting locked into contracts by promising them flexibility. If you understand the roadblocks your customers encounter on their purchase journey, you can overcome them right from the start. \n\n2. Dropbox \n\nDropbox leverages social proof in its value proposition to build trust with users. To reassure customers that it's a reliable and secure option for storing their private files. \n\nIf you have powerful stats to back up your value proposition, include them.\n\n3. ClickUp\n\nClickUp presents itself as a unified solution to appeal to users frustrated with having different project management apps for different tasks. It also appeals to its tech-savvy audience with a pop-culture reference headline. \n\n4. Starling Bank\n\nFintech company Starling Bank focuses on personalization and accolades in its value proposition. The promise of a bespoke experience sets it apart from established institutions. Awards give it credibility in an industry reliant on consumer trust.\n\n5. Blueland\n\nBlueland showcases how it simplifies the challenge of being more eco-friendly at home. You should avoid using hyperbole in your value proposition—but here the use of “revolutionary” fits contextually to highlight how the brand’s products are more innovative than competitors. \n\n 5. Bokksu\n\nSnackbox subscription service Bokksu emphasizes authenticity in its value proposition, a key desired outcome by consumers looking to experience another culture through food without the added cost of travel. It also includes tangible metrics: monthly deliveries and free shipping. \n\nGain Access to New Strategic Insights\n\nAn effective business understands its audience’s problems and delivers a specific solution for them.
