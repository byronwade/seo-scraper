  "content": "Learn how to write a blog post that attracts and engages your target audience.\n\nWe’ve broken down the entire process. To help you achieve your content marketing goals and become a better writer.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\n1. Choose a Blog Topic Idea\n\nFirst, decide what you’re going to write about. \n\nThe topic should be relevant to your brand. And interesting to your target audience. \n\nIf you haven’t already, create buyer personas like the one below. To gain a better understanding of your target readers. And what type of content they’re interested in.\n\nThere are many ways you can come up with topics:\n\nCheck out our list of blog post ideas\nConduct a brainstorming session with your team\nLook at competing blogs for inspiration\nAsk your audience what they want to read about (on social media or via email surveys)\nPerform keyword research (step two explains how)\n\nFor a data-led approach to blog post ideation, try Semrush’s Topic Research tool.\n\nClick “+ Enter domain to find content on.”\n\nEnter a broad topic idea. And your country and domain. \n\nThen, click “Get content ideas.”\n\nThe tool will provide a variety of content ideas.\n\nThose marked green are already covered on your site. While those with a flame icon are trending.\n\nClick “Show more” on any subtopic to see:\n\nSubtopic volume: The search volume (average number of monthly searches) for the subtopic keyword\nDifficulty: The subtopic’s keyword difficulty score, which measures how hard it is to rank highly for that keyword\nTopic Efficiency: A measure of subtopic’s search volume relative to its difficulty (higher = better)\nHeadlines: Headlines related to the subtopic (with links to the articles)\nQuestions: FAQs related to the subtopic\nRelated searches: Queries from the “Related searches” section in Google\n\nTo proceed with an idea, click “...” and choose one of the options.\n\nTip: For a more strategic approach to content production, create a content plan. This details all the content you’ll create over the coming weeks or months. Including blog posts.\n\nGet Blog Post Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Perform Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research tells you what people search for in search engines like Google. \n\nThis is important because adding keywords to your blog post can help your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. Meaning you rank higher in relevant search engine results pages (SERPs). \n\nPlus, keyword research lets you identify topics with the biggest SEO potential. Which is important if you’re using blog posts to increase organic traffic (unpaid search engine traffic).\n\nGet started with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a word or phrase to base your research around. Then, choose your country and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see keywords that include your starting term(s). Or a close variation.\n\nTo find relevant keywords for your blog post, focus on search intent—i.e., what the user is looking for when they perform this search.\n\nThe type of search intent is listed in the “Intent” column. Here’s a breakdown of each: \n\nI (informational): Users wants to learn more about something\nN (navigational): Users want to find a specific page or brand\nC (commercial): Users want to do research before making a purchase decision\nT (transactional): Users want to complete a specific action\n\nBlog posts typically rank for keywords with informational search intent.\n\nSo, let’s apply a filter for that type of intent:\n\nTo get a better understanding of a keyword’s search intent, perform a quick SERP analysis:\n\nClick the “View SERP” icon in the “Results” column.\n\nThen, see what kinds of pages rank.\n\nFor example, the SERP for “why a 29er mountain bike” is dominated by 29er bike guides. So, publishers trying to rank should create a similar kind of blog post.\n\nKeep in mind that it may be appropriate to target multiple keywords on the same page (i.e., do keyword clustering).\n\nFor example, “why a 29er mountain bike,” “what is a 29 mountain bike,” and “what is a 29er bike.”\n\nIn these cases, pick a primary keyword—the main keyword you want to rank for—to focus the blog post on. \n\nTaking the “Volume” and keyword difficulty score (labeled as “KD %”) into account.\n\nYour other keywords will become secondary keywords.\n\nTip: Perform keyword research with the Keyword Gap tool, too. This tells you keywords competitors rank for but you don’t.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Create an Outline\n\nCreating a blog post outline helps you plan your content effectively. So you can streamline the writing process and create a better post.\n\nWe recommend that your outline includes these elements:\n\n \t \n\n\nHeading structure\n\n\t\n\nUse subheadings to build a framework for your blog post \n\n\n\n\nMain points you want to include\n\n\t\n\nList the main points you want to include under each subheading. This will help you organize your ideas.\n\n\n\n\nTarget keywords\n\n\t\n\nList your target keywords. This will help you optimize your blog post effectively.\n\n\n\n\nSuggested word count\n\n\t\n\nMention approximately how long your blog post should be\n\n\n\n\nTarget audience\n\n\t\n\nInclude key notes about your target reader. So you can keep them at the forefront of your mind while writing.\n\n\n\n\nHelpful resources\n\n\t\n\nGather helpful resources, such as links to rival blog posts or information sources\n\n\n\n\nInternal link ideas\n\n\t\n\nUse internal links (i.e., links to other relevant pages on your site) to encourage users to stick around. And benefit your SEO. \n\n\n\n\nAssets to include\n\n\t\n\nGather any assets you could use in your blog post. Such as images, quotes, or statistics.\n\nIf you haven’t already, analyze similar content that’s performing well. To work out what searchers want—and how you can stand out.\n\nFor example, the top Google results for “why a 29er mountain bike” are all guides. With sections for the definition, benefits, and history of 29er bikes.\n\nChoosing a similar blog post format could help you compete. \n\nBut to outrank these rivals, you need to add value. To make your guide the best version out there.\n\nFor help planning different types of blog posts (such as how-to guides and listicles), check out our blog post templates. You can also get inspiration from our blog post examples.\n\nIf blog SEO is your priority, get recommendations from Semrush’s SEO Content Template tool.\n\nThe tool analyzes your top 10 rivals in Google results based on your target keywords, location, and device. \n\nTo provide a variety of suggestions:\n\nPlus, it shows how competitors use your target keywords. So you can optimize your content more effectively.\n\nCreate Blog Post Briefs\n\nwith the SEO Content Template Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Write the Body Content\n\nNow it’s time to write the main content.\n\nWe recommend saving the introduction, conclusion, and headline until last. So you can make sure they accurately reflect the body of your article.\n\nBut it’s a good idea to approach the other sections in order. So you can ensure flow between them.\n\nFirst, optimize the section’s subheading:\n\nMake it clear what the section will cover\nIncorporate target keywords where appropriate\nUse the appropriate header HTML tag (H2, H3, etc.)\n\nNext, write the bottom line up front (BLUF) in the first paragraph. In other words, provide an immediate answer or explanation.\n\nLet’s say you have a section entitled “What Is a 29er Bike?”\n\nYou should answer the question straight away. Like Canyon has here:\n\nDon’t make your reader wait. By writing “fluffy” content like this:\n\n“In the diverse world of mountain biking, where wheel sizes and frame geometries can vary greatly, the term ‘29er bike’ has carved out its own unique niche.”\n\nAfter your BLUF, go into more detail. Keeping your target reader in mind.\n\nAnd follow these tips for writing quality content:\n\nUse correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation\nMake sure every sentence adds value (i.e., avoid fluff)\nIncorporate target keywords where natural\nWrite clear and concise sentences\nAdd internal links to relevant pages\nKeep paragraphs short to improve readability\nUse bullet points, images, etc., to display information more effectively\nMake content actionable using examples and workflows\n\nFor help optimizing your blog post, use Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nSimply import a brief from the SEO Content Template tool. Or generate a new template based on your keywords and target audience.\n\nThen, start writing. \n\nThe tool scores your SEO, readability, originality, and tone of voice based on target parameters. \n\nClick highlighted text for recommendations.\n\nAnd use the Smart Writer tools to rephrase or compose content using AI.\n\nGet Real-Time Recommendations\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Add an Introduction and Conclusion\n\nThe introduction to your article should let readers know exactly what’s coming.\n\nMake sure to apply BLUF and keep your writing succinct.\n\nFor example, the first line to a 29er mountain bike guide should read something like this:\n\n“This guide will explain what a 29er mountain bike is and whether it’s right for you.”\n\nNot like this:\n\n“Imagine a world where the trails seem smoother, obstacles appear less daunting, and every turn in the path beckons with an allure of adventure.”\n\nThe conclusion to your article should tell readers what to do next.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to convert readers into leads or customers.\n\nBut the right approach depends on the topic. And where readers are in the marketing funnel. \n\nFor example, it makes sense to promote your mountain bike range at the end of a buying guide. But this could be overly salesy in other contexts.\n\nIn the next section, you’ll learn how to write a good blog post headline.\n\n6. Write Your Headline\n\nThe headline is one of the most important parts of your blog post. It impacts how many people read your content. And whether they’re satisfied with what they find.\n\nHeadlines can affect search rankings, too. So spend some time perfecting them.\n\nThe most important thing is that your headline is descriptive. \n\nIt should establish the tone upfront and set the right expectations for your readers. Otherwise, they’ll end up disappointed.\n\nYou also need to grab people’s attention. \n\nHere are a few ways to make headlines more engaging (with examples):\n\nUse numbers: 5 Essential Mountain Biking Skills Every Rider Should Master\nAsk questions: Is It Time to Upgrade Your Mountain Bike?\nStart with an action verb: Discover the Secrets of Advanced Mountain Biking\nGive a personal angle: How Mountain Biking Became My Therapy\nBe controversial: Why Carbon Frames Aren’t Worth the Hype\nTry wordplay: Bikes, Backpacks, and Breathtaking Trails\nCreate urgency: Last Chance Trails: Must-Visit Spots Before Winter\nHighlight benefits: How to Boost Your Biking Skills in 30 Days\n\nCheck out these headline examples for more inspiration.\n\nOr enter your blog post topic into the Free Title Generator. And click “Get my titles.”\n\nThe tool will provide a variety of headline ideas. Organized by type.\n\nWhatever you write, make sure to apply these headline SEO tips:\n\nWrap your headline in an H1 tag so search engines know it’s the main heading\nInclude your primary keyword in the headline—ideally near the start\n\nNow you know how to write a great blog post draft. But let’s go through some other essential steps.\n\n7. Review Your First Draft \n\nIf possible, wait a day or so after finishing your first draft. Then, come back and review it with fresh eyes.\n\nThis will help you spot spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. And other opportunities for improvement.\n\nIf you’re part of a team, consider asking someone else to read your draft. And provide constructive feedback and edits.\n\nTip: Tools like Grammarly and Hemingway App can help you proofread your blog posts. And become a better writer.\n\nHow does AI transform content marketing? 🔥\n\nExplore our 2024 report on AI content marketing!

Or schedule it to publish later.\n\nIf you haven’t already, create a content calendar. Like the one below.\n\nThis will help you maintain a regular publishing schedule. And align with other marketing activities or real-world events.\n\nBefore going live, make sure your blog post is formatted correctly. (Things can go wrong during the upload process.) \n\nAnd add relevant metadata, including:\n\nURL slug: The unique part of the URL. This is usually auto-generated based on your headline, but you might want to customize it. It should be short, descriptive, and future-proof. \nTitle tag: The title that appears in search engine results and the user’s browser tab. This should be the same as or similar to your headline.\nMeta description: The short description that can appear in search engine results. This should let searchers know what to expect from your blog post. And encourage them to click through.\nAlt text: The image descriptions used by search engines and screen readers. These improve your page’s accessibility. \nOpen Graph tags: The title, description, and image displayed on social platforms like Facebook when your article is shared\n\nYou might need to install a plugin to help you edit some of these elements.\n\n9. Distribute Your Blog Post\n\nOnce your blog post is live, share and promote it through other marketing channels.\n\nThis is called content distribution. And it’s key to maximizing your post’s reach.\n\nHere are six popular tactics to try:\n\nSocial media marketing: Share your blog post via social media platforms\nEmail marketing: Add a link to your blog post in your next email newsletter\nInfluencer marketing: Pay relevant influencers to promote your post\nPPC marketing: Advertise your blog post via ads, including ones on relevant SERPs\nEmail outreach: Contact relevant influencers and convince them to share or link to your post\nContent syndication: Republish your blog post on other sites (e.g., Medium)\n\nIt’s also a good idea to repurpose your blog post into other formats.\n\nFor example, use the AI Video Marketing Automator to turn your blog posts into videos. \n\nThis allows for greater success on other platforms. And helps you reach audiences with different needs and preferences.\n\n10. Track Performance Metrics\n\nChoose and track performance metrics based on your blog posts’ goals.
