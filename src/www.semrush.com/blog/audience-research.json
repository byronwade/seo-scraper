  "content": "Audience research is a vital part of marketing and advertising. By understanding the needs and pain points of the people who interact with your brand, you can improve your messaging, SEO, and most importantly—client acquisition.\n\nWhat Is Audience Research?\n\nAudience research aims to understand your target market in order to better know their needs, goals and challenges. Conducting audience research requires looking at the size, composition, and defining criteria of your audience.\n\nAs a result of your research, you will be able to separate your audiences into groups called segments. These individuals share certain characteristics—for example, their age, interests or how often they use a product. \n\nFrom there, you can make your marketing campaigns, content, and ads more relatable to your audience. \n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Audience Research?\n\nCarrying out target audience research provides insights that can help your business achieve its goals faster and more efficiently. That can translate to improved customer acquisition, customer retention, and revenue.\n\nAudience research also helps marketers stay in touch with the people that matter most. Knowing a group of people’s average age, pain points, and preferences will allow marketing teams to see their audience as real people, instead of just an abstract concept. Most importantly, it allows marketers to connect with audiences more deeply because they understand how they think, behave, and live. \n\nAt the same time, audience research can highlight opportunities and obstacles for your brand. \n\nFor example, if your competitors are trying to communicate with your desired audience but aren’t succeeding, audience research can reveal why and how you could create content that resonates more successfully. Your brand can then develop more relevant campaigns for audiences and stay ahead of the competition. \n\nWhen conducting audience research, most companies opt to create a buyer persona, which describes the ideal customer in terms of their preferred channels, messaging, and what their motivations are. Buyer personas humanize audience research and ensure that you speak to the right customers in the right way.\n\nResearch Your Audience In-Depth\n\nwith Audience Intelligence\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Research Your Target Audience\n\nAudience research is an ongoing process that can collect both quantitative and qualitative metrics.\n\nQuantitative Research\n\nQuantitative research includes facts, figures and statistics to give an overview of your audience segments. \n\nThis data includes users’ demographics (age, location, education, and profession) and users’ behavior (online activity, buying habits). It can be collected via analytics tools that track where users are based, as well as how they engage with your marketing material and product. Data capture forms are also effective for quantitative information.\n\nQualitative Research\n\nQualitative research, on the other hand, gets personal insights from your user base. For example, it might include reviews, feedback, exit interviews, survey results, onboarding FAQs, and other information.\n\nOther data includes users’ psychographics (interests, opinions, lifestyle), and can be collected through focus groups, surveys, questionnaires, and feedback forms. Survey generators, quiz-making tools, and in-person meetings can help gather audience data. \n\nAudience research tools can also produce qualitative insights, and keep audience research up to date, correct, and processed according to your business needs. Such solutions save time and are more accurate than manual audience research.\n\nExamples of Audience Research Approaches\nAudience Analysis Tools \n\nFor brands with large audiences, audience analysis tools automatically analyze and visualize data for audience segments.
