  "content": "Content marketing tactics are ways to reach and engage target audiences through online content (e.g., blog posts, social posts, and videos).\n\nThey help you reach goals outlined in your content marketing strategy.\n\nBelow, we’ve rounded up 10 of the most effective content marketing tactics to use in 2024 and beyond.\n\nTip\n\nClaim your free trial to follow along with the Semrush tutorials in this guide.\n\n1. Analyze and Satisfy Search Intent\n\nCreate content that targets relevant keywords (i.e., search engine queries). And satisfies their search intent (i.e., what the user wants).\n\nThat way, you can increase your brand’s organic (unpaid) visibility in search engines like Google. And attract more potential customers to your website.\n\nFind the best keywords for your brand by performing keyword research.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nGo to Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. And enter a term to base your search around (one that’s related to your brand).\n\nThen, add your domain and target country before clicking “Search.”\n\nThe tool will search Semrush’s database of over 26 billion keywords. To display “Broad Match” keywords containing your starting term or a close variation.\n\nThey’re sorted by “Volume.” Which represents the average number of monthly Google searches.\n\nAnother important metric is “PKD%” (Personal Keyword Difficulty). \n\nThis estimates how hard it’ll be for your site to earn a top-10 organic ranking for the keyword.\n\nIf you’re new to search engine optimization (SEO), it’s best to target keywords in the “Very Easy” to “Easy” range (0% to 29%). And work your way up over time.\n\nLower-difficulty keywords usually have lower search volumes. But it’s generally better to rank highly for a low-volume query than lowly for a high-volume query. Because most users don’t scroll very far.\n\nNext, pay attention to the “Intent” column.\n\nThis shows the type of search intent (user goal) behind each keyword:\n\nInformational (I) means the typical user is seeking information\nCommercial (C) means the typical user is researching a product, service, or brand\nNavigational (N) means the typical user is seeking a particular webpage or website\nTransactional (T) means the typical user is looking to make a purchase \n\nGenerally, informational and commercial keywords are best for content marketing. \n\nYou can see what type of content performs well for a given keyword by reviewing its search engine results page (SERP).\n\nJust click the icon in the “SF” column:\n\nIf this type of content seems like a good fit for your brand—and you think the keyword is worth targeting—go ahead with creating search-optimized content.\n\nCreate Optimized Content and Satisfy Search Intent\n\nThere are two main things you must do to optimize content for a particular keyword (or group of related keywords):\n\nSatisfy search intent effectively\nMake your content search engine-friendly\n\nSemrush’s SEO Writing Assistant can help.\n\nStart a new text, fill out the details, then click “Get recommendations.”\n\nNext, start writing your content in the editor. And follow these best practices:\n\nMinimize time to value (i.e., avoid unnecessary fluff and satisfy users’ needs quickly)\nFocus on information gain (i.e., add unique insights and ideas to your content)\nMake sure your content is accurate and easy to read\nStructure your content with heading tags (H1, H2, etc.)\nGive your content a descriptive and engaging title\nUse a tone of voice that suits your brand and target audience\nBreak up your text with visuals, where appropriate \n\nAs you write, the tool will provide feedback on SEO, readability, and tone of voice. \n\nThese suggestions are based on best practices and analyses of competing content.\n\nThe “Smart Writer” can help you draft or improve your content.\n\nWhen you’re happy with your draft, conduct an originality check. To ensure your content is totally unique before publishing.\n\nCreate Optimized Content\n\nwith Semrush’s SEO Tools\n\nStart Free Trial →\n2. Leverage Primary Data \n\nPrimary data is information unique to your business. It can help you create engaging, unique content. \n\nTake Spotify Wrapped, for example.\n\nIn this yearly campaign, Spotify provides users with a personalized summary of their listening habits over the past 12 months. And shares global and national trends.\n\nIt drives a ton of social media and press activity.\n\nTo get started with this content marketing tactic, identify primary data your business has access to. (Or consider conducting research so you can gather it.)\n\nFor instance:\n\nSurvey responses\nSales data\nWebsite analytics\nProduct usage data\n\nThen, think about what kinds of questions your data could answer. Questions your audience will be interested in.\n\nYou can then perform data analysis to get the answer.\n\nIf your findings are interesting and new, you have a story to tell.\n\nFor example, Spotify answers questions like “Who’s the most streamed artist on Spotify?”\n\nThen shares its findings through the app, press releases, blog posts, social media posts, and various other formats. To maximize audience reach.\n\nVisualizations are commonly used to make data more engaging and shareable.\n\nImage Source: Spotify\n\nNote\n\nIt’s possible to analyze data from external sources and discover unique stories. But primary data tends to make your content more unique, interesting, and authoritative.\n\n3. Use Topic Clusters\n\nA topic cluster is a set of interlinked webpages (usually blog posts) that work together to cover a topic comprehensively.\n\nIt contains a pillar page, which provides a topical overview. And multiple cluster pages, which address associated subtopics. \n\nHyperlinks connect the pillar page to all the cluster pages—and vice versa. \n\nLike this:\n\nTopic clustering is a good content marketing technique because it helps build topical authority.\n\nIn other words, users and search engines are more likely to think of you as a subject matter expert. Which can lead to more traffic, search visibility, and engagement.\n\nYou can gather ideas for your clusters with the Topic Research tool.\n\nJust enter a topic and target country to get a list of subtopic ideas. Along with useful data about each one.\n\n4. Repurpose Existing Content\n\nRepurposing content (i.e., adapting content into different formats) can improve your reach and engagement. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause doing so caters to people with varying needs, preferences, and habits. And allows you to distribute content across different platforms.\n\nRepurposing also tends to be quicker and easier than creating content from scratch. \n\nSo, it can be a highly cost-effective content marketing tactic.\n\nWhen repurposing, start with your best-performing content. To see if you can replicate its success across other platforms.\n\nYou can then brainstorm suitable content marketing formats. Based on subject matter, your target audience, and your wider marketing strategy.\n\nFor instance, a B2B marketer might be able to repurpose a blog post into a:\n\nWebinar\nPodcast\nVideo\nEbook \nInfographic\nLinkedIn post\nNewsletter\n\nSometimes, it’s smart to use multiple formats together. \n\nEmbedding a video in a blog post, for example, can improve engagement of visual learners. \n\n5. Build a Content Marketing Funnel\n\nA content marketing funnel is a collection of content that works to engage prospects across the entire buying journey. \n\nIt covers three main stages:\n\nTop of the funnel (ToFu): Prospects become aware of the problem you can solve\nMiddle of the funnel (MoFu): Prospects want a solution and consider their options\nBottom of the funnel (BoFu): Prospects decide on a solution and become customers\n\nThe funnel diagram represents the audience size narrowing as the journey progresses toward purchase:\n\nA robust content marketing funnel allows you to reach more prospects, build stronger relationships with them, and guide them toward conversion.\n\nIf you have a weakness at any stage of the funnel, prospects are likely to go to a competitor instead.\n\nTo illustrate, let’s look at the mattress brand Casper.\n\nThe company has blog posts about various sleep problems. These attract people at the top of the funnel who might be interested in a new mattress—but don’t know it yet.\n\nCasper also offers mattress buying guides and comparison guides.\n\nThese are designed to help people in the middle of the funnel. Who are researching their options. \n\nAt the bottom of the funnel, detailed product pages and customer service FAQs help turn shoppers into buyers. \n\nCreate Optimized Content\n\nwith Semrush’s SEO Tools\n\nStart Free Trial →\n6. Launch Gated Content\n\nGated content is high-quality content that users must submit their information to access. \n\nLike this:\n\nThe main goal is to generate leads. If users give permission, you can contact them with personalized emails.\n\nCollecting data can also give you valuable insight into audience demographics etc.\n\nTo get started, you need to develop a piece of high-quality content tailored to your target audience. Common types of gated content include:\n\nResearch reports\nWhite papers\nEbooks\nWebinars\nNewsletters\nTools\nTemplates\nProduct demos\n\nThen, build the landing page that encourages users to opt in.\n\nWhen designing the form, carefully consider what fields to include. More fields means more data but increases the risk of the user backing out.\n\nTip\n\nCreate conversion-focused landing pages with Landing Page Builder. The app has a click-and-drag interface and multiple templates to choose from. To make building a landing page as easy as possible.\n \n\n7. Engage in Thought Leadership\n\nThought leadership is the process of sharing original ideas, insights, and opinions. With the aim of influencing or inspiring others. And building your reputation.\n\nFor example, Alex Novarro argues that businesses “should stop planting trees and start protecting forests” on behalf of Trellis (a sustainability networking company).\n\nThought leadership is a particularly good B2B content marketing tactic. Because business buyers tend to value expertise and innovation highly.\n\nYou can publish thought leadership content on your own blog, social media profiles, etc. Or try to get featured in industry publications.\n\nTo do so, you’ll need to come up with an engaging idea. And send convincing outreach emails to relevant websites.\n\nTip\n\nCheck out our dedicated guide to learn more about B2B content marketing.\n\n8. Create Skyscraper Content\n\nSkyscraper content is content designed to be a better version of a widely linked resource. \n\nThe goal is to inherit the links the resource already has. And ones it could acquire in the future. \n\nBecause links from other websites (backlinks) can drive valuable referral traffic. And boost your SEO.\n\nTo see which of your competitor’s pages get the most backlinks, enter their domain (or a relevant subfolder) into the Backlink Analytics tool. And click “Analyze.”\n\nGo to the “Indexed Pages” tab to see which pages have links from the most domains.\n\nReview the content by clicking the icon that looks like this:\n\nAnd determine if you can create a better version of the page.\n\nPerhaps you can:\n\nMake the content more comprehensive\nInclude original ideas, insights, or data\nAdd better visuals or interactive elements\n\nAfter creating skyscraper content, contact the reputable sites that link to your competitor’s page. And encourage them to link to your version, instead.\n\nYou can manage the entire outreach process (and identify other link building prospects) with Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nBuild Links to Your Content\n\nwith Semrush’s SEO Tools\n\nStart Free Trial →\n9. Encourage User-Generated Content\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is content created by your audience.\n\nEncouraging UGC can be a cost-effective way to increase content production.\n\nIt can also improve your relationship with your audience:\n\nPeople who create UGC may feel more involved with and valued by your brand\nPeople who consume UGC may view your brand as more authentic and trustworthy\n\nFor example, action camera brand GoPro runs a “photo of the day” challenge. \n\nThe company gives winners a cash prize. And shares winning entries on its social media profiles with millions of followers.\n\nThis content marketing tactic allows GoPro to generate high-quality content at a relatively low cost. And foster an engaged community around its brand.\n\nConsider what types of content your users could create. And incentivize them to create it.\n\n10. Try Storytelling\n\nStorytelling can be an effective content marketing technique. Because it allows you to communicate your brand values in a more humanistic, engaging way.\n\nIt generally involves telling real stories about people in your community.\n\nFor example, outdoors brand Patagonia created a film about a surfer trying to protect a vulnerable coastline.\n\nThe story doesn’t directly reference Patagonia or its products. But it signals that the brand is passionate about the same things its target audience is.\n\nPlus, that kind of high-quality content elicits an emotional response. People who are passionate about the film’s message are likely to share it with their peers, increasing Patagonia’s reach.\n\nTo tell a good story, you typically need:\n\nA structured narrative with a beginning, middle, and end\nCompelling characters that humanize the story\nEmotional appeal\nAuthenticity (i.e., a message that truly aligns with your brand’s values)\nMeasuring the Success of Content Marketing Tactics\n\nTo discover the most effective approach for your brand, you must measure the success of your content marketing tactics.\n\nThat means tracking two vital things:\n\nWhat resources you invest\nWhat benefits you gain (and over what time frame)\n\nNot all benefits are easy to measure. But there are many content marketing metrics you can use to gauge your performance.\n\nFor example, the Position Tracking tool lets you monitor your keyword visibility in Google.\n\nYou can make the most of this tool and many others with your free Semrush trial.\n\nCreate & Track Content\n\nwith Semrush’s SEO Tools\n\nStart Free Trial →",
