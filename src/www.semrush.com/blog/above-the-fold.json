  "content": "What Does ‘Above the Fold’ Mean?\n\nAbove the fold (ATF) refers to the visible part of a webpage before the user scrolls down.\n\nThe fold is the line where the unscrolled page cuts off at the bottom. Anything you have to scroll down to is below the fold.\n\nAs the illustration above shows, the user’s device affects the precise point of the page fold. Other factors, such as browser settings, also affect the size and shape of the viewing window, known as the viewport.\n\nNote\n\nThe above the fold meaning comes from newspaper publishing. Newspapers are typically displayed on newsstands folded in half, so editors place the most attention-grabbing elements above the fold—literally.\n\nWhy Is Above the Fold Important?\n\nAbove-the-fold website content is important because it’s where users form their first impressions. And where they expect to see certain website features (e.g., a signup link).\n\nIf visitors don’t immediately find what they’re looking for, they might exit your page.\n\nThis behavior can harm business performance and your SEO. Because search engines like Google want to serve results that users positively engage with.\n\nPlus, Google considers content that appears near the top of a page to be more important. This means ATF content can have a bigger impact on your search rankings than BTF content.\n\nThat’s why above-the-fold SEO should be a priority.\n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\nAbove the Fold Best Practices\n\nAbove-fold content is crucial in capturing visitors’ attention. We’ve rounded up best practices that can help you deliver a great user experience (UX). And ultimately increase revenue.\n\nPlus, we’ve included above-the-fold SEO strategies that can help your pages rank higher in Google.\n\nHere are best practices for your ATF design:\n\nUse a Responsive Website Design\n\nA responsive website design automatically adapts to the size and shape of the user’s viewport. It helps ensure images, text, and other elements always fit properly.\n\nThis allows you to make the most of the space above the fold (and below the fold), whether the user’s browsing on:\n\nA large, horizontal desktop monitor\nA small, vertical smartphone screen\nOr something else altogether\n\nHere’s an example of responsiveness in action on the Semrush blog:\n\nFor advice on implementing a responsive layout, check out Google’s help guide.\n\nThen, make sure to run regular technical audits. So you can check for any performance issues.\n\nSemrush’s Site Audit tool performs over 140 checks. To ensure your site performs well on desktop and mobile devices.\n\nYou can schedule a daily or weekly audit. Or re-run the crawl manually.\n\nImprove Website Performance\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nOptimize Your Website Header\n\nThe website header is the topmost part of a webpage, typically duplicated across every page of a site. It keeps key elements in the same easy-to-reach place. Which is great for UX.\n\nA website header typically includes the brand logo, which links to the homepage. So users can navigate to this key page quickly. \n\nThe header typically includes the main navigation menu, too—i.e., links to the main sections of your site. \n\nMany web designers save space by placing the main navigation in a hamburger menu. Especially on mobile. But this means it takes users an extra click to access key pages.\n\nBelow are some other elements to consider including in your website header:\n\nBanner: Use a website banner to advertise unique selling points like free shipping \nSign-in/signup links: Encourage visitors to create an account or sign in, which makes it easier for you to track customer behavior and increase engagement\nRegion/language flag: If you have a multi-regional or multilingual site, allow users to switch between options\nSearch function: Include a search bar or icon so users can quickly find what they want\nShopping cart icon: If you have an ecommerce site, make it as easy as possible for shoppers to start the checkout process\n\nAdding extra elements to your website header can increase its functionality. But a cluttered design takes up valuable space above the fold and can be difficult for users to navigate. Designers must strike a balance here.\n\nInclude a Unique Heading\n\nEvery page should have a unique, descriptive heading displayed above the fold. This allows users to quickly understand the page’s purpose. \n\nOn the Mashable site, prominent headlines tell visitors exactly what to expect.\n\nIncluding a unique heading can also assist with above-the-fold SEO.\n\nWhen asked about ATF’s impact on rankings, Google’s John Mueller said: “The important part for us is really that there is some amount of unique content in the above-the-fold area. \n\n“If you have a banner on top and you have a generic hero image on top, that’s totally fine. But some of the above-the-fold content should be unique for that page. And that could be something like a heading.”\n\nTo further improve your on-page SEO, wrap the headline in H1 tags (the topmost HTML heading).\n\nLike this:\n\nAnd ensure the heading includes your primary keyword (the main search query you want to rank for).\n\nTo review your current headings, use Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker.\n\nImport your pages and their target keywords. And the tool will provide a list of top pages to optimize.\n\nOpen the ideas for any page to see whether the H1 contains a target keyword.\n\nAnd if so, whether the keyword is overused. This is an issue called keyword stuffing, which can harm your SEO.\n\nYou’ll also see ideas relating to:\n\nTitle tags (page titles that can appear in search results)\nMeta descriptions (descriptions that can appear in search results)\nSemantic keywords (conceptually related terms)\n\nAnd much more.\n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\nGet to the Point\n\nUsers should be able to find what they’re looking for quickly and easily. So get to the point as soon as possible. Ideally above the fold.\n\nThis is known as improving time to value. And it’s good for SEO, as well as the user experience.\n\nWhen building a page, ask yourself the following questions:\n\nWhen someone lands on this page, what do they want to achieve? \nHow can I help them achieve this goal quickly?\n\nTake the men’s jeans category page on Levi’s site. Shoppers are immediately greeted by various product options and photos.\n\nOn the Prana website, most of the product images and information sit below the page fold. Users have to scroll to get to the good part. Meaning the page is less likely to grab their attention.\n\nAlso consider the Semrush blog template.\n\nThe estimated reading time and table of contents set readers’ expectations upfront. And visitors can start reading the article without scrolling past unnecessary visual elements.\n\nNotice how the writer gets straight to the point, too. This is an SEO copywriting technique known as BLUF (bottom line up front).\n\nDon’t waste space on fluffy introductions. Focus on giving your visitors what they came for.\n\nTip\n\nNeed help writing copy that makes an impact from the start? Check out Semrush’s content writing services.\n\nBalance Ads with Original Content\n\nIf you monetize your website with Google AdSense or another advertising program, you might want to display ads above the fold. Where more users can see and click on them.\n\nThat’s OK. But it’s important to balance advertising with your own content. If visitors are greeted by large blocks of ads—not what they came for—they might leave your site for a competitor.\n\nPlus, unbalanced ads can harm your above-the-fold SEO. Especially on mobile, where they can take up a larger portion of the screen.\n\nIn 2012, Google released a page layout algorithm update that demoted sites using ATF ads “to an excessive degree.”\n\nThe announcement said: “If you click on a website and the part of the website you see first either doesn't have a lot of visible content above-the-fold or dedicates a large fraction of the site's initial screen real estate to ads, that's not a very good user experience. Such sites may not rank as highly going forward.”\n\nGoogle recommends following the Better Ads Standards, which advise against the following mobile web experiences (among others):\n\nPop-up ads\nLarge sticky ads\nAd density above 30%\n\nFor example, ESPN places mobile advertising above the fold to maximize clicks. But the ad is balanced by a large amount of original content.\n\nIncrease Loading Speeds\n\nYour above-the-fold content should load quickly. If users are left waiting too long, they’re more likely to exit your page. Plus, loading speeds impact SEO rankings.\n\nThe most important page speed metrics are known as Core Web Vitals:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n\n\t\n\nThe time is takes for the largest image or text block to load\n\n\n\n\nFirst Input Delay (FID)\n\n\t\n\nThe time it takes for the page to respond to a user’s interaction\n\n\n\n\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n\n\t\n\nA measurement of unexpected movements that occur during loading\n\nYou can check your Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console.\n\nOr use Semrush’s Site Audit tool. The Core Web Vitals report shows key metrics at a glance. And provides detailed recommendations on how to improve.\n\nBelow are some best practices for improving ATF load time:\n\nStructure your HTML: Structure your HTML so ATF content loads first\nMinify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Streamline your code so it’s processed more quickly\nInline critical CSS: Critical CSS is a technique that extracts the CSS for ATF content and places it in the <head> section of the HTML. This can help ATF content load more quickly. \nOptimize images: Resize, reformat, and compress image files to ensure they’re as small as possible—without sacrificing quality\nPreload resources: Use the rel=”preload” link attribute to load top fold elements early in the rendering process\n\nTip\n\nRead our guide to learn more about page speed and how to improve it.\n\nCheck Page Speed Metrics\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for FREE →\nMake It Look Good\n\nYour ATF content should function properly. But it needs to look good, too. If visitors don’t like what they see, they’re more likely to leave.\n\nWeb designs have just 0.05 seconds to make a good first impression, according to a Behaviour & Information Technology study.\n\nHere are some top tips for above-the-fold design:\n\nMake sure text is easy to read and has a clear visual hierarchy\nAdd unique visuals to break up text and aid understanding\nInsert relevant videos and animations to grab users’ attention\nSave space by using recognizable icons—explore options in Google’s Material Symbols\nUse empty space (also known as negative or white space) to prevent your layout from looking cluttered\nEnsure the design complements your brand identity\nMake sure your site meets accessibility guidelines\n\nTip\n\nNeed help from an expert? Check out Semrush’s trusted web design agencies.\n\nAnalyze Performance Metrics\n\nPerformance metrics tell you what’s working in your above-the-fold design. And what isn’t. \n\nThe most important metrics depend on your specific goals. But the ones below are worth considering. And they’re all accessible through Google Analytics.\n\nMetric\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nWhy It Matters\n\n\n\n\nBounce rate\n\n\t\n\nThe percentage of visitors who leave the page without taking any action\n\n\t\n\nStronger ATF content can decrease bounce rates\n\n\n\n\nExit rate\n\n\t\n\nThe percentage of visitors who leave your site from the current page\n\n\t\n\nStronger ATF content can decrease exit rates\n\n\n\n\nScroll depth\n\n\t\n\nThe portion of the webpage your average visitor views\n\n\t\n\nShows whether your ATF content encourages users to scroll down the page\n\n\n\n\nGoal conversion rate\n\n\t\n\nThe percentage of visitors who take the desired action (e.g., make a purchase)\n\n\t\n\nStronger ATF content can increase conversion rates\n\n\n\n\nOrganic traffic\n\n\t\n\nThe number of unpaid visits referred by search engines such as Google\n\n\t\n\nGood above-the-fold SEO can increase organic traffic\n\nTip\n\nRead our Google Analytics guide for help getting started.\n\nTo view key data in one place, connect your Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts to Semrush’s Organic Traffic Insights tool. \n\nCompare the following metrics across your landing pages (pages designed to prompt specific actions):\n\nNumber of keyword rankings\nBounce rate\nGoal completion rate\nShould CTAs Be Above or Below the Fold?\n\nGenerally, every landing page should have at least one call to action (CTA) that prompts visitors to take a desired action (e.g., “Add to Cart” or “Sign up Now”).\n\nSome marketers argue that a CTA should always appear above the fold (like below). So users can see and interact with it quickly. \n\nBut visitors aren’t always ready to take action as soon as they land on your page. \n\nSo, you might get better results by placing the CTA further down—somewhere below the fold. After users have had a chance to absorb more information and make a decision.\n\nTo find out what works best on your pages, conduct A/B tests (or split tests).\n\nHere’s a quick guide to how it works:\n\nDecide which CTA location you want to test and create the new webpage design\nServe the new design (the variant) to 50% of visitors and the existing design (the control) to the other half\nFully implement whichever version generates the most conversions \nAbove the Fold Website Examples\n\nThese above-the-fold examples show best practices in action. Across various types of websites and pages.\n\nGet inspiration for your ATF designs:\n\nLush\n\nAbove the fold on this Lush homepage, a striking product photo grabs users’ attention. \n\nFun, bold, and colorful, the image is on brand. And it works in tandem with the linked Mother’s Day heading to engage shoppers.\n\nLush overlays other useful links on the image, rather than using a navigation bar. This helps keep focus on the Mother’s Day campaign. And makes the website header clean and easy to use. Instead, the search bar (complete with suggestions) ensures shoppers can find what they need.\n\nOn the right side of the page, circular indicators show there’s more to be discovered below the fold.\n\nKombu\n\nPeople landing on this Kombu product page have probably tried the drink before. And are ready to place an order. The ATF design is centered on that simple act.\n\nThe “add to cart” button appears prominently against a high-contrast background. And the minimalistic layout ensures no distractions.\n\nThat said, there is a “Scroll” prompt in the lower-left corner. Letting visitors know they can get more information if they want it.\n\nTip\n\nSee our dedicated guide for more product page examples and best practices.\n\nESPN\n\nOn ESPN’s desktop site, advertising takes up a relatively high proportion of the page. But it complies with the Better Ads Standards for desktop experiences by avoiding pop-up ads, auto-play video ads with sound, countdown ads, and large sticky ads.\n\nOne standout element of this ATF design is the “upcoming events” bar. It appears at the top of most pages and automatically updates to the current sport in view.\n\nThe events bar delivers valuable information upfront, helping ensure a positive user experience. It also brings together useful links that encourage visitors to remain on-site. \n\nAlso note the auto-playing video that starts above the fold. This helps attract users’ attention and encourage them to scroll down. (The sound is muted by default, to ensure compliance with Better Ads Standards.)\n\nSmile Direct Club\n\nIt’s clear that pricing is important to Smile Direct Club’s customers. The ATF banner, headline, and description tackle pricing objections upfront.\n\nThe accompanying image showcases the product (clear aligners) and its benefits (straight teeth). While the award logo and Trustpilot reviews build trust.\n\nNotice how the CTA button “AM I A CANDIDATE?” appears twice above the fold. It’s clear to the user what they should do next. And they can start right away.\n\nVisitors who want more information can find key links in the navigation bar. Or open the live chat in the lower-right corner.\n\nNordstrom\n\nNordstrom’s product category pages have multiple navigational features above the fold.\n\nSubcategory tabs, such as “Over the Knee” and “Hiking,” give an immediate impression of a vast and diverse product range. Reassuring shoppers they’ll find what they’re looking for.\n\nAt the same time, product filtering and sorting options prevent shoppers from feeling overwhelmed. They know the product range won’t be too difficult or time-consuming to navigate.\n\nSo, they’re more likely to stick around. And find the perfect product.\n\nAirbnb\n\nThe Airbnb homepage fits essential navigation elements above the fold, encouraging travelers to start their search. Icons make it easy for users to find and visualize accommodation types.\n\nOtherwise, the layout leaves as much space as possible for eye-catching listings from the “Amazing views” category. \n\nEach accommodation preview contains details that matter most to travelers. And entice click-through.\n\nPhotos\nAverage star rating\nLocation\nDates\nHost type\nPrice\n\nWhen you search a location, Airbnb ranks results based on quality, popularity, and price. Helping ensure that the most engaging listings appear above the fold.\n\nAnd a map appears. Whether you’re on desktop, mobile, or the app. Because Airbnb knows locations are crucial to travel-planning users. \n\nMake Improvements with Split Testing\n\nIf you update your ATF content, it’s important to compare key metrics before and after. So you can ensure your changes have a positive effect.\n\nBetter yet, use split testing (or A/B testing). This allows you to compare two above-the-fold designs and see which performs best, according to real user data.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nCreate a new version of your ATF content (known as the variant)\nDisplay the old version (known as the control) to half of users and the variant to the other half\nAnalyze key metrics over a set time period\nImplement the version that performed best\n\nThe SplitSignal app makes it easy to run A/B tests and measure the impact on organic traffic. You don’t need web development or data science expertise.\n\nPerform SEO Split Tests the Easy Way\n\nwith the SplitSignal App\n\nLearn More →",
