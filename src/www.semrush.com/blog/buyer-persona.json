  "content": "The most successful marketers go beyond audience data and hard numbers, and think deeply about who their customers actually are as people. What are their interests? How do they talk? What do they believe in and value?\n\nWhen you know your customers deeply, you can communicate authentically and inspire action. You can speak to their specific needs and desires, and do so in a language familiar to them. These factors can have a profound impact on your conversion rate. \n\nThere’s only one problem: You can’t create a unique marketing massage for each individual customer. At a certain point, you need to find a balance between specificity and generalization, and this is where buyer personas come into play. \n\nA Buyer Persona Definition \n\nA buyer persona—also called a user persona, marketing persona, or audience persona—is a fictional profile of your ideal customer based on market and audience research. In other words, it’s an imaginary person that embodies the most important characteristics found within your broad audience. \n\nJust like a real living and breathing customer, a buyer persona should have a demographic and psychographic profile, behavior trends, values, desires, pain points, and affiliations. Though the persona is fictional, the profile should be as well rounded as possible.\n\nGenerating buyer personas isn’t about describing a potential customer or a vision for business expansion. To the contrary, the buyer persona should reflect individuals who already exist within your target market to help marketing, sales, and product departments make better decisions.\n\nWhy Are Buyer Personas Important for Business? \n\nAfter an initial market assessment, creating buyer personas is the next logical step for businesses. This step allows businesses to understand their target market thoroughly before making significant investments in product development, marketing strategies, and sales infrastructure.\n\nWorking with buyer personas can help: \n\nGuide product development \nInform content generation efforts\nProvide insights for lead follow-up\nImprove customer acquisition and retention strategies \n\nWhen businesses begin with the customer in mind, the end results tend to be positive. Among other things, personas lead businesses toward higher-value customers, better leads, and higher conversions and customer retention rates. \n\nNetProspex published a case study reporting that its target persona creation efforts led to a doubling of the number of page views per visit, a 900% increase in site visit duration, and a 171% spike in marketing ROI.\n\nWho Should Be Involved in Creating Your Buyer Personas? \n\nMost businesses include stakeholders from multiple departments across the company as they create their buyer personas. This may slow down the process, but it ensures that insights from across the company are taken into account.\n\nTypically, these 5 business departments are included: \n\nMarketing—The marketing team is responsible for creating messaging and campaigns that appeal to specific audience segments \nSales—The sales team has direct contact with customers and can provide insights into their needs, pain points, and motivations\nCustomer service—The customer service team has direct contact with customers and can provide insights into their behavior, preferences, and feedback\nProduct development—The product development team can provide insights into the features and benefits that customers are looking for in a product or service\nManagement—Senior management can provide strategic direction and ensure that the buyer personas align with the company’s overall goals and objectives\n\nBringing a variety of stakeholders to the table ensures customer experiences from across the board are included and that everyone in the company is in agreement with the buyer personas you build. \n\nHow Businesses Put Buyer Personas into Practice \n\nIn practice, buyer personas can help drive many essential processes within a company. Here are a few examples: \n\nProduct development—Buyer personas offer valuable insights into the needs, preferences, and pain points of the target audience. This understanding helps businesses develop products that meet customer needs and provide solutions to their problems.\nMarketing strategy—Buyer personas help businesses understand audience motivations and behaviors, which can help craft messaging that drives engagement. \nSales infrastructure—Buyer personas can help you identify the most effective sales channels and tactics for your target audience so businesses can tailor their sales approach. \nCustomer support—Buyer personas can help you provide better customer support by understanding your audience’s communication preferences and support needs. \nCreate Your Own Buyer Persona Template \n\nHaving a buyer persona template is essential before conducting research. It enables you to organize insights and gather information required to paint a comprehensive picture of your hypothetical customer. \n\nBuyer persona template’s criteria vary based on business needs and goals, and businesses commonly include various criteria when creating their buyer personas.\n\nDemographics \n\nDemographics are the characteristics of a specific population. They are often closely related to the individual’s identity and can have a large impact on their experience of the world. \n\nSome examples of demographics are: \n\nAge \nSex \nLocation\nFamily status \nLevel of education\n\nBecause demographic factors are such an important component of the customers experience, they should definitely be included on the user persona template. \n\nProfessional Status \n\nProfessional status refers to the occupational or employment status of individuals in the market audience. \n\nThese can include:\n\nJob title\nIndustry\nWork arrangement (in office or remote) \nLevel of seniority\nIncome\n\nThis criteria is particularly important in business-to-business (B2B) marketing, where targeting decision-makers and influencers within a company can greatly impact the success of a marketing campaign.\n\nPsychographics \n\nPsychographics refer to personality, values, interests, and attitudes of a target audience. It goes beyond demographics to identify the psychological characteristics of individuals that influence their behavior as consumers.\n\nSome examples include: \n\nValues \nBeliefs \nPolitical views \nLifestyles\n\nUnderstanding psychographics can help create a more emotional connection with customers and increase conversions. \n\nInfluences and Information Sources \n\nInfluences and information sources reveal where customers spend their time, where they get their information, and who they trust.\n\nSome examples are: \n\nPreferred websites and blogs\nFavorite social networks\nFavorite media (digital/audio/print)\nInfluencers and thought leaders they trust and look up to \nFavorite events or conferences (online or offline)\n\nThis information is a valuable source to guide influencer marketing, communication, PR, advertising, and content placement efforts.\n\nPain Points \n\nPain points are the specific problems or challenges customers face while trying to accomplish their goals or meet their needs. \n\nThey can include things like: \n\nFrustrations\nInconveniences \nObstacles \nInconsistencies \nDissatisfactions \n\nBy understanding the specific problems or challenges customers face while trying to achieve their goals or meet their needs, businesses can create solutions that directly address these issues.\n\nPurchasing Process \n\nPurchasing process data provides information about how customers make purchases. \n\nThis includes:\n\nRole in the purchase decision-making process\nPotential lifetime cycle (the frequency or use or purchase) \nBarriers in the purchasing process\n\nBy understanding the customer’s perspective and experience, businesses can improve their chances of converting potential customers into actual customers and building long-term relationships with them.\n\nA Free Buyer Persona Template from Semrush \n\nSemrush offers a free buyer persona tool for building your buyer personas. The tool includes several templates and provides guiding questions to help inspire your process. Once you’ve completed your personas, the tool makes it easy to save them and share across teams. Check it out for a quick entry point into your buyer persona building process. \n\nHow Do You Do Buyer Persona Research? \n\nWhile buyer personas are technically fictional people, they should be built upon a strong foundation of data-driven insights. So the question becomes: Where do you get the audience data to gain the insights you need to create your buyer personas? \n\nHere are some of the most common sources of data for your buyer personas: \n\nCustomer research—Collecting data through surveys, focus groups, interviews, and observation. This is a popular option for well established businesses who already have a large customer base. \nDirect customer feedback—Soliciting feedback from customers about their experiences through online reviews, customer service interactions, and social media interactions. This is also a good option for well established companies. \nGovernment data sources—Accessing publicly available data from government agencies, such as the Census Bureau or Bureau of Labor Statistics. This data can provide information about demographics, economic indicators, and market trends.\nIndustry research—Collecting data through market research reports by organizations like Gartner or Forrester, industry publications, and competitor analysis tools. Though this data can be costly, it offers insights that go beyond what businesses can gather from their own audience.\nSocial media—Tracking social media conversations, interactions, and trends on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. It also enables businesses to understand how people discuss their industry and adjacent interests.\nAnalytics software—Collecting and analyzing data from various sources, such as website traffic, social media engagement, and email campaigns. Analytics software can provide insights into consumer behavior, preferences, and interests.\n\nFor data on your own website’s audience, you can use Google Analytics, but for data on competitor’s audiences you’ll need to turn to a tool like Semrush’s One2Target. \n\nAs you can see, there are a number of ways to gather data to help with your buyer persona research. Since more data is always better, you’ll likely rely on more than one data source as you work toward the insights that will help you build your personas.​\n\nHow Many Buyer Persona Interviews Should You Aim to Complete? \n\nIf you choose to do interviews as part of building your buyer personas, you may be wondering how many interviews you should complete. It’s a good question, and the answer depends on a few things. \n\nThe complexity of your product or service—The more complex your offering, the higher the number of interviews you will want to conduct. For example, with a product that has many functions, you’ll want to interview individuals who will use it in all of it’s various ways. \nThe size of your target audience—A larger target audience will likely have more segments, and therefore, more kinds of customers. Each of these segments should have its own buyer persona, so with large audiences, more interviews are better. \nThe resources you have available—The amount of resources, including budgets and time, matter when thinking about the number of interviews to conduct. It can be difficult to get volunteers for interviews, and they take time to conduct. Keep these things in mind as you set your aim on an ideal number of interviews. \n\nRegardless of your decision, it’s important to focus on diversity of experience so you can get the best understanding of your audience’s demographics, needs, pain points, and behaviors. The more interviews you’re able to conduct, the more clearly you’ll be able to see commonalities and patterns emerging. \n\nAt the same time, the quality of interviews matters more than the number of interviews completed. As a general rule of thumb, shoot for 5-7 interviews per persona. \n\nUncover target audience peculiarities\n\nsources, regions, visitor behavior, and more\n\nFind out Now →\nWhy You Should Create a Buyer Persona Story \n\nThe human mind is unique in its tendency toward narrative. As humans, we understand the world and our place in it through the stories we tell. “First, this happened. Then, that started. And finally, here I am!” \n\nLikewise, creating a story associated with the buyer persona can help bring it to life and make it more relatable. A buyer persona story is a fictional story that represents the typical customer’s challenges, goals, and motivations for a product or service, based on research and insights. \n\nIt usually includes a protagonist, demographics, psychographics, pain points, and decision-making process. By presenting buyer personas in narrative form, it becomes easier to empathize with customers, understand their needs, and create effective marketing messages that resonate with them.\n\nFrom Data to Persona: a Buyer Persona Research Example\n\nNow that we’ve covered a ton of information about what buyer personas are and why they’re crucial for businesses, let’s look at how they’re made. Here, we’ll use Semrush’s One2Target tool to gather some data and design an example buyer persona. \n\nFor this example, let’s pretend we work for a bicycle manufacturer that wants to start selling mountain bikes. We’ll begin by choosing 3 mountain bike brands we admire (and hope to one day compete with) to understand our audience. \n\nAge and Sex \n\nFirst, we turned to the Demographics Report. The mountain bike market based on our three domains reveals that the majority of audience members are males between the ages of 35-44. \n\nSocioeconomics \n\nThen, we looked at the Socioeconomics Report. The majority of the audience lives in households of 3-4 people (likely families), and have a lower income. They work full time and have a college degree. \n\nInterests \n\nBeyond mountain bikes, the Audience Overlap Report showed the audience also visited sites like REI and Nerdwallet, suggesting an interest in outdoor activities more generally and also enjoy personal finance. \n\nSocial Preferences \n\nFinally, we looked at their social media preferences in the Behavior Report. This audience prefers Youtube, but also spend time on Facebook and Reddit. \n\nAn Example Persona \n\nBased on the data gathered from the One2Target tool, we can begin to imagine our buyer persona. Here’s the raw data: \n\nMale \nAge 35-44\nHousehold size of 3-4 \nWorks full time \nBachelor’s degree \nLower income \nLikes outdoor activities and personal finance \nPrefers youtube, but also likes Facebook and Reddit \n\nBased on these insights, we can begin to generate ideas into a more deeply imagined buyer persona. \n\nBrian Hernandez is a male aged 35-44. He lives in Vermont with his wife and two children. He works full time as a marketer for an outdoor apparel company, and has a bachelor’s degree from Bennington College. He likes outdoor activities like hiking and camping, and also has an interest in financial planning.\n\nWhen he isn’t outdoors, he likes to watch mountain biking videos on Youtube. He stays in contact with college friends through facebook, and looks to Reddit to stay connected to the mountain biking community and find ideas about where to ride his bike in the Green Mountains of Vermont. \n\nDon’t Let Your Business Outgrow Your Personas \n\nIn conclusion, user personas are a valuable tool for businesses to understand and connect with their target audience. However, it’s important to remember that user personas are not static; they need to evolve as your business grows and your audience changes. \n\nDon’t let your business outgrow your personas—instead, regularly revisit and update them to ensure they accurately represent your current target audience. \n\nBy keeping your user personas up-to-date, you can continue to create effective marketing strategies and provide your customers with the products and services they need and want. Remember, the key to success is staying connected to your audience and adapting to their changing needs and preferences.\n\nUncover target audience peculiarities\n\nsources, regions, visitor behavior, and more\n\nFind out Now →",
