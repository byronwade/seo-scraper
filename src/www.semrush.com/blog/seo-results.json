  "title": "SEO Results: How to Measure SEO Performance & Success",
  "content": "SEO performance refers to how well a website ranks on search engines (like Google) and attracts organic traffic.\n\nBut there are many useful ways to monitor SEO results.\n\n1. Organic Traffic\n\nOrganic traffic is the number of visits that come to your site from organic (meaning unpaid) search engine results. \n\nIt’s a good indicator of how well your webpages rank for relevant keywords (terms and phrases that your ideal audiences search online). And how many visits you get that may eventually translate to more customers. \n\nOne way to measure your organic traffic is by using Google analytics 4. And heading to “Reports” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”\n\nLike this:\n\nThen, adjust the report to show data for the last full month. And check the number of sessions (visits) you’ve received in the “Organic Search” row.\n\nTo assess how strong your organic traffic performance is, compare it against the main players in your space. Go to Traffic Analytics, enter your main competitors’ websites, and click “Analyze.”\n\nMake sure the selected time range matches what you used in Google Analytics.\n\nThen, scroll down to the “Traffic Channels” section and hover over “Organic Search” to see how much organic traffic your competitors get.\n\nCompare these values to your own organic traffic measurement.\n\nIf your competitors are getting significantly more traffic from organic search, perform a full competitor analysis (which includes finding search terms they target, analyzing their content, etc.) to figure out why. And come up with a strategy to outperform them.\n\nIf you need help, check out our SEO competitor analysis guide that teaches you how to do that.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Organic Traffic\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Keyword Rankings\n\nA keyword ranking is your website’s position on a search engine results page (SERP) for a specific keyword or phrase. \n\nAnd the higher you rank, the more traffic you’re likely to drive to your site. \n\nBut a website’s keyword rankings can frequently change. For any number of reasons. \n\nPerhaps Google updates its algorithm, you lose backlinks, or your competitors update their content to improve it. \n\nSo, keeping a watch on your SEO rankings is important.\n\nLosing ranking positions may mean losing traffic to your site—which may hurt your business. \n\nOne of the best ways to monitor your keyword rankings is to set up a campaign in our Position Tracking tool. It’ll track your rankings daily. And automatically. \n\nOpen thetool, enter your domain name, and click “Set up tracking.” \n\nThe tool will ask you to choose a domain (“Root domain,” Subdomain,” etc.). And to pick a search engine, device, location, and language to track your rankings. \n\nWhen you’re done, click “Continue To Keywords.”\n\nIn this next screen, add the keywords you want to track. \n\nYou can add them manually or click the “Import from…” button to import a list from an existing resource like a CSV file or a previous campaign. Or get suggestions from Semrush.\n\nThen, click “Start Tracking.” \n\nOnce it’s all set up, you’ll see your rankings in the dashboard. \n\nLike this:\n\nIf you’re unhappy with where you currently rank, you can take steps to improve your rankings by getting authoritative sites to link to you, increasing your page load speed, and using other optimization tips..\n\nCheck Your Keyword Rankings\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. SERP Visibility\n\nSERP visibility is a measure of how often and how prominently your website appears on search engine results pages for relevant keywords. \n\nIt takes keyword rankings into account. But also the presence of SERP features—nontraditional organic results like featured snippets, knowledge panels, image packs, and others. \n\nYou can easily check your website’s visibility using the Position Tracking tool we outlined earlier.\n\nFirst, you’ll see a “Visibility” index in the dashboard.\n\nThis percentage is based on click-through rate and shows your site’s progress in Google’s top 100 results for the keywords in your tracking campaign. \n\nA 0% visibility score means your domain isn’t ranking in Google’s top 100 results for any of your tracked keywords. \n\nAnd a 100% visibility score means your domain ranks in the first position in the SERP for all your tracked keywords. \n\nThe higher your visibility percentage, the better your chances of bringing visitors to your site.\n\nNow, click on the “Overview” tab. \n\nScroll down, and you’ll see a table with keywords from your campaign and how much visibility you have for each one.\n\nKeep a close eye on this table. And do what you can to bring your visibility percentage up.\n\nFor example, some best practices to increase visibility include:\n\nEditing your content to better optimize for the SERP features that are currently appearing in the search results\nAdding structured data (special code) to your pages to help Google understand and better present your content in the SERPs\nBuilding more backlinks (links from other websites that point to your pages)\n4. Impressions\n\nImpressions are the number of times your site was viewed in search results in a given time period.\n\nIt’s an important metric for tracking your SEO progress because it gives you an idea of whether your efforts are helping you appear in search results.\n\nOften, the first sign of SEO success is an increase in the number of organic impressions for your website.\n\nTo track impressions, go to the “Search results” report in Google Search Console.\n\nAnd you’ll see the total number of impressions your website received in the selected time frame.\n\nNow, scroll down and click the “Pages” tab. And you’ll see impression data on a page-by-page level.\n\nIf you’ve taken the steps to optimize your website for SEO, your impressions should increase over time. As your pages start appearing more prominently and for more related queries. \n\n5. Click-Through Rate \n\nClick-through rate (CTR) is the percentage of users who click on your website from the SERP. \n\nIt shows how effective your titles and descriptions in SERPs are in attracting searchers’ attention and interest.\n\nAnd it’s calculated by dividing the number of clicks by the number of impressions, then multiplying that number by 100. \n\nFor example, if your site appeared on a SERP 100 times in a month and 10 people clicked on it, your CTR is 10%.\n\nTo review your Google CTR, log in to Google Search Console. \n\nThen, click on “Search results” under “Performance.” \n\nCheck the box next to “Average CTR” to see your site’s average click-through rate.\n\nYou can also check CTR on a page-by-page basis. Scroll down to the table below and switch to the “Pages” tab.\n\nTo increase your CTR, consider rewriting your title tags (HTML that specifies your page titles and may appear in search results) to include power words (e.g., “best,“ “free,“ “step-by-step,” etc. ), numbers, or brackets.\n\nAnd make sure each title tag is 55 characters or less so it doesn’t get truncated in search results.\n\nYou can also rewrite your meta descriptions (HTML that provides page descriptions and may appear in SERPs) to try to improve your CTR.\n\nSo, ensure you’re using phrases like “find out,” “learn more,” and “dive deep” that can nudge users to click through to your pages.\n\nAnd make sure your descriptions are brief and contain no more than 105 characters each. To avoid truncation.\n\n6. Conversions\n\nA conversion is when a user completes a desired action on your site—like subscribing to a newsletter, downloading an ebook, signing up for a trial, making a purchase, etc.\n\nIf you have high conversions, it means your pages are effective in turning visitors into leads or customers.\n\nIn Google Analytics, conversions are called “key events.” \n\nTo track your key events, set them up in Google Analytics. \n\nHere’s Google’s guide on creating and editing key events on how to do just that.. \n\nAnd then, you’ll be able to track the organic visits that translate to key events. \n\nTo see your key events, go to “Reports” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”\n\nNow, you’ll see the key event rate for all channels. Including organic search.\n\nHere are some conversion optimization tips to improve your results: \n\nUse clear and compelling calls to action (CTAs)\nSimplify forms and checkout processes by only asking for essential information\nLeverage pop-ups to capture visitors before they leave\n7. Bounce Rate\n\nBounce rate is the percentage of users who visit your site but leave without engaging—like going to another page or filling out a form. \n\nThis specific SEO measurement shows how engaging and relevant your content is for the visitors who land on it.\n\nAnd monitoring bounce rate can help determine if there are any weaknesses in your SEO approach or website—like slow loading speed, poor mobile optimization, a mismatch between content and keywords, and more.\n\nYou can check your bounce rate in Google Analytics.\n\nOpen the tool and navigate to “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Engagement” > “Pages and screens.”\n\nTo add bounce rate to the report, click the pencil icon to customize your report.\n\nSelect “Metrics” from the “Report Data” section.\n\nAnd then click on the “Add metric” drop-down, choose “Bounce rate,” and hit “Apply.”\n\nYou should now be able to see the bounce rate in your report.\n\nIf you want to benchmark your bounce rate against your competitors, use our Traffic Analytics tool.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your competitors’ domain names, and click “Analyze.” \n\nYou’ll see a table with the average bounce rates for all the domains. And the difference compared to the previous month. \n\nLike this:\n\nYou can also see a trend graph by scrolling down to “Trend by Competitors” and clicking on “Bounce Rate.” \n\nSee how you compare. And take steps to improve if needed.\n\nHere are a few tips to help lower your bounce rate:\n\nEnsure you’re addressing search intent (the main reason why users are searching a term)\nMake your content easy to read and navigate\nAdd internal links to other pages on your site\n\nCompare Your Bounce Rate with Your Competitors\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n8. Website Authority\n\nWebsite authority is an SEO metric that predicts how well your website will rank on search engines. \n\nAt Semrush, we call this metric “Authority Score.” And it’s based on the quality and quantity of your site’s backlinks, organic search traffic, and other data. \n\nThe score is presented on a logarithmic scale of 1 to 100. And the higher your score, the stronger and more authoritative your domain. \n\nYou can find any domain’s Authority Score in Domain Overview, Backlink Analytics, Backlink Audit, and the Link Building tool. \n\nNote\n\nYou can create a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along. \n\nTo better understand your site’s Authority Score, compare it with your competitors’ Authority Scores. \n\nOpen Backlink Analytics, enter your domain, and click “Analyze.” \n\nThen, add up to four competitors’ domains and hit “Compare.”\n\nDon’t get too hung up on your exact score. But do work on trying to improve it. \n\nAnd one of the most effective ways to do that is to build high-quality backlinks to your site. \n\nWe’ll get into exactly how to do that in the next section. \n\nCheck Your and Your Competitors’ Website Authority\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n9. Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are links from other sites that point to yours. \n\nAnd they’re one of the most important ranking factors for Google—they help show your site is trustworthy and valuable to others.\n\nWhich means:\n\nTracking and monitoring your backlinks is critical. And you can easily do that with Backlink Analytics.\n\nEnter your domain and click “Analyze.” \n\nYou’ll get a snapshot of your site’s referring domains (sites that link to you at least once) and total backlinks. \n\nYou can also scroll down to see trend graphs for both metrics. \n\nFurther down, you’ll see trend graphs for new and lost referring domains and backlinks.\n\nWork on continuously building high-quality backlinks to your site. \n\nSome popular link building tactics include:\n\nLinkable content: Creating link-worthy assets like infographics, in-depth guides, and original research that naturally attracts links from other websites\nEmail outreach: Reaching out to other websites in your niche and asking them to link to your quality content\nBroken link building: Helping web admins find and fix broken links on their site and getting backlinks in return\nUnlinked brand mentions: Asking websites that mention your brand name without linking back to the website to make the mentions linked\n10. Technical Health\n\nHaving good technical health means search engines can crawl (find) your webpages, index (store in a database) them, and rank them for relevant queries.\n\nIt also impacts how fast your website can load and how easy it is to use on mobile devices. And both of these are crucial factors for search engine rankings\n\nBut how do you check your website’s technical health? \n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your domain name, and click “Start Audit.”\n\nThen, use the configuration guide to set up your audit. \n\nAfter it’s done, you’ll see a dashboard like this:\n\nNotice your Site Health score (also called an SEO score or technical health score). It measures your site’s overall health based on the number and severity of the issues the audit uncovered. \n\nThe higher the score, the fewer critical issues your site has. And better it will likely rank in search results.\n\nNext, click on the “Issues” tab. You’ll see all the technical issues listed one by one.\n\nWork on fixing them. And if you’re not sure how, click the “Why and how to fix it” link next to the issue for a quick explanation. \n\nCheck Your Website’s Technical Health\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n11. Engagement Time\n\nEngagement time (sometimes called time on page) is the average amount of time your webpage was the user’s main focus.\n\nIt’s a helpful metric to see how well your content meets search intent. Which is important for SEO.\n\nWhen a searcher types a keyword into Google, lands on your page, and spends a lot of time there, it suggests that your site satisfied their intent. \n\nThey found what they were looking for. And it was useful. \n\nOn the other hand, a low time spent on a page can indicate a mismatch between what the user was looking for and what your page contains. \n\n(However, engagement time is not a perfect measure of content usefulness or whether you’ve satisfied search intent. For some queries, engagement time will naturally be low.)\n\nIn any case, you can track the average time visitors spend on your site using Google Analytics. \n\nLog in to your GA4 account and go to “Reports” > “Engagement” > “Pages and screens.” You’ll see the metric under the column “Average engagement time.”\n\nPages that have a notably lower number are worth investigating.\n\nAnd an easy way to determine search intent is to run the page’s target keyword through Keyword Overview.\n\nYou’ll see its search intent in the “Intent” box. \n\nThen, ensure your pages’ content meet the right type of intent. \n\nHow Long Does It Take to See SEO Results?\n\nIt takes a noticeable amount of time to see results with SEO. \n\nSo, treat SEO as part of an ongoing project that will never be complete. \n\nYour timeline for seeing results will also depend on how new your site is, how good your SEO strategy is, and how consistent you are in implementing your tactics. \n\nIf you have all that going for you, expect to start seeing results within four months to a year. \n\nRemember that your website’s visibility and rankings will be heavily influenced by who your competitors are and what keywords you’re trying to rank for. \n\nTo know if you’re making progress, track results and refine your strategy as data comes in. \n\nOver time, you’ll see it pay off. Prioritize sustainability over speed. And you’ll enjoy the rewards for longer. \n\nFurther reading: How to Get Faster SEO Results\n\nEvaluate Your SEO Performance\n\nNow that you know how to measure SEO performance, it’s time to take it a step further and try for yourself.\n\nOpen your Google Search Console, Google Analytics, and Semrush accounts.
