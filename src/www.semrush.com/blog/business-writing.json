  "content": "What Is Business Writing?\n\nBusiness writing is a type of professional communication that uses clear, concise language to convey information, provide education, persuade an audience, or achieve a specific goal in a business context. And can take various forms like proposals, reports, emails, press releases, and memos.\n\nBusiness writing relies on good grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary. Plus, the ability to adapt the tone, style, and structure to the intended reader and situation.\n\nHow Is Business Writing Different from Other Kinds of Writing?\n\nBusiness writing is not just writing for a business. It’s writing with business in mind.\n\nIt’s about communicating effectively with your audience. Who could be customers, colleagues, investors, or stakeholders.\n\nIn fact, business writing has unique characteristics that set it apart from academic writing, creative writing, journalism, and other forms of content writing. \n\nHere are the main differences:\n\nIt has a clear purpose and goal. Business writing is meant to achieve a specific outcome, such as solving a problem, making a decision, or taking an action. You need to know what you want readers to do after reading your document—and write accordingly.\nIt’s structured and organized. Business writing presents information logically and coherently. You need to use visual aids to guide readers and highlight key points and actions.\nIt’s concise and precise. Business writing should get to the point quickly using simple and direct language. You need to avoid ambiguity, jargon, and filler words that can confuse or bore your readers.\nIt has a professional tone. Business writing is formal and follows the rules of etiquette and grammar. You should use a polite and appropriate tone and address readers by their names or titles (if necessary). And avoid slang, humor, or personal opinions.\n\nTip\n\nYou can quickly check and adjust your content’s tone of voice (and other factors) using the SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nTypes of Business Writing\n\nBusiness writing can be classified into four main types: instructional, informational, persuasive, and transactional.\n\nHere’s an overview of each—including some specific business writing examples:\n\nInstructional Business Writing\n\nThis type of business writing is used to help the reader perform a task, learn a skill, or understand a process. It includes documents such as manuals, procedures, policies, tutorials, etc.\n\nFor example, consider a user guide for a software product. It’s an instructional business document that explains how to install, use, and troubleshoot the product.\n\nInformational Business Writing\n\nThis type of business writing is used to inform or educate the reader about a topic, issue, or event. It includes documents such as reports, memos, newsletters, and emails. \n\nFor example, a market research report is an informational business document that presents the findings, analysis, and recommendations of a market study.\n\nPersuasive Business Writing\n\nPersuasive business writing aims to motivate the reader to take a specific action, such as buying a product, signing a contract, or supporting a cause. And includes documents such as proposals, pitches, advertisements, etc. \n\nFor example, think of a sales-focused ad. It’s a persuasive type of business communication that showcases the features, benefits, and testimonials of a product or service. And urges the reader to take action.\n\nTransactional Business Writing\n\nThis type of business writing confirms, acknowledges, or records a business transaction or interaction. To ensure smooth, efficient communication in daily operations. And includes documents such as invoices, receipts, orders, confirmations, etc. \n\nFor example, an order confirmation email is a transactional business message that confirms the order number, items, price, delivery date, and payment method used in an online purchase.\n\nThis type of business writing is also crucial for legal records. And helps in legal cases or regulatory compliance.\n\nBusiness Writing Fundamentals\n\nThese are the elements it takes to execute strong business writing:\n\nSimplicity\n\nSimplicity means using plain and easy-to-understand language. \n\nSo, avoid jargon and acronyms that may confuse or alienate readers. And use short sentences and paragraphs. \n\nIf you need to use a complex or unfamiliar term, explain it or provide an example.\n\nA great way to check for simplicity is to use an online proofreader. Just paste your text in and look for a readability assessment:\n\nDirectness\n\nDirectness means getting to the point quickly and confidently. To cut through the fluff and tell readers exactly what to do.\n\nYou can do this by stating your main point, recommendation, or request at the beginning with positive and assertive language. Then, follow with supporting details and evidence. \n\nUsing bullet points or numbered lists helps, too. They let readers see the key points quickly, making your message easier to comprehend.\n\nLike in this example from one of our own emails:\n\nClarity\n\nClarity is expressing the information in a clear and logical way that avoids ambiguity and confusion. Which ensures smooth communication and efficient decision-making in any business setting.\n\nHow do you write with clarity?\n\nUse active voice, subject-verb-object structure, and transitions to show the relationship between your points. \n\nAn online proofreader can highlight instances where you use passive voice, excessive pronouns, or weak adjectives:\n\nTime to Value\n\nTime to value is all about helping readers get something out of your writing as soon as possible. Which means presenting the key information right away.\n\nLike this article from Investopedia does:\n\nUse examples, stories, and data to illustrate your points and show how they apply to your readers’ situations. \n\nAnd include a clear call to action (CTA) that tells your readers what to do next.\n\nConcision\n\nConcision is all about eliminating unnecessary words and information that don’t add value or meaning. To make your business writing more impactful. \n\nSo, be specific and precise. Use modifiers sparingly and only when they enhance your message. And avoid repetition, filler words, and vague expressions. \n\nAn online proofreader can help you see where you have generic words that don’t add value:\n\nFormatting\n\nUsing visual elements and design principles makes your business writing easy to read, scan, and navigate. \n\nUse headings and subheadings to break up the text and let readers quickly find what they need.\n\nBullet points are great for drawing attention to important details or steps.\n\nAnd using white space, margins, and alignment creates a clean and professional layout. Which helps readers focus on the content without feeling crowded.\n\nYou can also add tables, charts, graphs, and images to show complex information in a simple way. They provide a nice visual break and add extra value. \n\nJust take a look at how much easier it is to digest the information in a document that uses effective formatting:\n\nProfessional Tone\n\nUsing a respectful and formal style that matches your purpose, audience, and context ensures your message comes across the right way.\n\nAvoid slang, colloquialisms, humor, sarcasm, or emojis that may be inappropriate or misunderstood. \n\nInstead, use polite and positive language. And avoid negative or harsh words that may offend or antagonize your readers. \n\nHere’s an example of Apple using a professional tone in a press release:\n\n8 Effective Business Writing Tips\n\nHere are eight practical tips to improve your business writing skills and achieve your goals.\n\n1. Think About What You Want to Write\n\nBefore you start writing, have a clear idea of what you want to say, why you want to say it, and how you want to say it. \n\nThis will help you plan your document, structure your content, and choose your style. To make your message stronger and more focused. \n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\nWhat’s the purpose of your document?\nWhat’s the main point or message you want to convey?\nWhat are the key facts, arguments, or evidence you want to include?\nWhat are the benefits or outcomes for your readers?\nHow do you want your readers to feel or act after reading your document?\n\nThis preparation builds a strong base for any type of business writing.\n\n2. Consider Your Audience\n\nYour audience is the most important factor in business writing. You need to know who they are and what they need or want to effectively communicate with them.\n\nConsider:\n\nWho your reader is, where they work, and what their role is\nWhat your reader’s background, level of knowledge, and interest in your topic are\nWhat your reader’s goals, challenges, and pain points are\nWhat questions, objections, or concerns your reader might have\nWhat tone of voice you think is most appropriate based on your reader\n\nYou can quickly check and adjust your writing’s tone of voice using a tool like the SEO Writing Assistant. \n\nJust paste your text in and click the “Tone of voice” button on the right. \n\nThe tool displays your content’s current tone of voice and overall consistency (how well you keep the tone of voice across your text). \n\nScroll down. You’ll see the tool highlights sentences you should consider removing or replacing for consistency. \n\nIf you want to change the target tone of voice, click on the pencil icon above the “Tone of voice” bar on the right. \n\nThen, move the slider toward more formal or more casual depending on your audience. And click “Change target tone of voice.”\n\nImprove Your Business Writing in Real Time\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign Up Now →\n3. Create an Outline\n\nAn outline is like a roadmap for your document. It helps you organize ideas, structure your content, and avoid missing any important points. \n\nAn outline can also save you time and effort. Because you can easily see what you need to write and how to write it. \n\nFor example, use ContentShake AI to help you generate an optimized outline. \n\nStart by entering a few terms related to your industry, business, or niche. And click “Start writing.” \n\nThe tool will create a list of potential topics and article ideas. Once you find one you’d like to pursue, click “Start writing” to generate content.\n\nThe tool will return an SEO-optimized outline that includes a title, an introduction, subheadings, images, and initial copy. Which you can then add to and adjust by clicking “Go to editor.” \n\nHead to the “Improvements” tab and click “Edit targets” to make sure you get suggestions based on your specific needs. \n\nAdjust the “Readability level” and “Tone of voice type” for your business writing. And click “Save.” \n\nThen, fine-tune the article by adding your own thoughts and making edits based on the tool’s suggestions.\n\nOnce you’ve finished, you can publish your article via the WordPress plugin, send it to Google Docs, or create a shareable link.\n\nThen, rinse and repeat. \n\nYou can do it all in one place. Making it quick and easy to create high-quality content.\n\n4. Take a Bottom Line Up Front Approach\n\nOne of the best ways to make your business writing clearer and more direct is to use the bottom line up front (BLUF) approach. \n\nThis means stating your main point, recommendation, or request first. And then adding supporting details and evidence. \n\nUsing BLUF helps readers understand the main point right away—without getting lost in details. And it makes your content easier to scan and digest. \n\nTo use BLUF, begin your writing with the most important information. At the very top. \n\nFor example:\n\nBLUF email subject line: “Need your feedback on report by Friday”\nBLUF sales pitch: “Our product can help you save 30% on your energy bills. Here’s how.”\nBLUF presentation slide: “Revenue increased by 15% last quarter thanks to these three strategies”\n5. Incorporate Storytelling\n\nBusiness writing is more effective when it tells a story. \n\nNeurological research actually shows that storytelling encourages greater emotional engagement and improves memory. Which means your message will get across better.\n\nAnd a good story includes:\n\nA hero (or heroes) the narrative is framed around\nA problem that needs to be addressed\nChallenges that are faced along the way\nPossible solutions that can solve the problem\nA satisfying resolution\n\nFor example, consider this case study from Adobe:\n\nIt tells a compelling narrative that shows how the brand’s products enabled a major fashion brand to rapidly scale their creative processes.\n\n6. Use Active Voice\n\nActive voice is when the subject of the sentence performs the action. While passive voice is when the subject of the sentence receives the action. \n\nFor example:\n\nActive: The manager approved the project\nPassive: The project was approved by the manager\n\nUsing active voice makes your business writing clearer, more concise, and more powerful. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it avoids ambiguity and confusion. And clearly conveys who’s responsible for the action, what the action is, and what the result is.\n\nTo check your business writing for active voice, run it through the SEO Writing Assistant. \n\nIt’ll highlight instances where you should consider using active voice. Along with other factors that affect readability. \n\n7. Include a Call to Action\n\nA CTA is a statement that tells readers what you want them to do next. Such as buy, subscribe, download, contact, visit, etc. \n\nLike this:\n\nCalls to action are essential for any business writing that aims to persuade, influence, or motivate your readers to take a next step. \n\nHere are a few tips for including a call to action:\n\nMake it clear and specific\nMake it compelling and urgent\nMake it convenient\nUse action verbs\nUse positive and assertive language\n8. Proofread Your Work\n\nProofreading is the final step of your business writing process. And involves checking and correcting any grammar, spelling, SEO, originality, or style errors. \n\nIt’s a crucial last step for ensuring the quality and professionalism of your business writing. \n\nAnd it ensures you don’t damage your credibility or relationship with your audience. \n\nTo proofread your work:\n\nUse a spelling and grammar checker\nRead your document out loud or have someone else read it for you\nUse a checklist or a guide to spot and fix common errors\nTake a break and review your document again with fresh eyes\n\nIf you want to thoroughly and quickly proofread any business writing, run it through a tool like Grammarly. \n\nImprove Your Business Writing at Scale \n\nYou just learned the fundamentals of effective business writing and tips to get started.
