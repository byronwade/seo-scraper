  "content": "With over 1 billion active users worldwide, TikTok provides ample opportunity to boost your brand’s visibility. For the best chance of being seen by your target audience, you need to optimize your content with TikTok SEO.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn what TikTok SEO is, how it works, and five ways you can use it to get more views. \n\nWhat Is TikTok SEO?\n\nTikTok SEO (search engine optimization) involves enhancing your content so it’s more likely to be seen by your target audience—preferably by showing up on their For You Page (FYP) and ranking higher in TikTok’s search results.\n\nThe FYP is TikTok’s homepage that offers new content with every swipe. It’s driven by TikTok’s algorithm, which is designed to feed users more of what they like.\n\nTo keep the platform experience fun and engaging, TikTok constantly recommends new videos based on users’ engagement behaviors (views, likes, comments, etc.). \n\nTikTok also has a search function:\n\nThe FYP and search results pages are the two main ways that users discover new content on the platform. They’re highly sought-after locations for content.\n\nWhy Is TikTok SEO Important? \n\nOptimizing your TikTok content gives your brand a greater chance of showing up on your audience’s FYP page or search results. TikTok SEO tactics, such as including hashtags, helps the algorithm index your content.\n\nFor example, if a user likes or favorites financial videos or enters search queries about related topics, TikTok will recommend similar videos and accounts on the user’s FYP.\n\nTikTok’s search feature is another crucial discovery hub for users. Many use the app as a search engine. \n\nIn fact, younger users are using TikTok in place of Google Maps or Search for discovery purposes. \n\nTikTok provides a source of entertainment, information, and inspiration.\n\nThis means there are many ways to meet your audience where they are. It also means that brands need to learn what types of content and which terms users are searching for.\n\nTikTok SEO Ranking Factors\n\nTikTok has been relatively quiet about what it takes to satisfy its algorithms and rank well on the platform. Here are the factors it has confirmed contribute to ranking on the platform:\n\nUser interactions: Users will see more TikTok videos like the ones they’ve liked, shared, commented on, or favorited in the past. TikTok also recommends similar videos to those a user creates on their own page.\nVideo information: The algorithm recognizes, sorts, and recommends content based on information such as hashtags, sounds (the song or audio clip in the video), and captions on each post. \nDevice and account settings: Users receive content recommendations based on their language preferences, country settings, and type of device. This means that people living in English-speaking countries or with English set as their primary language will see videos in that language.\nValue to user: Watching a video from start to finish strongly suggests a user enjoyed a video. This indicator holds more weight than others (e.g., being in the same location as the creator).\n\nAs with most algorithms, TikTok’s algorithms are always changing, and the company keeps its inner workings under lock and key. \n\nThe best way to learn what works is to run your own tests—or follow tips from trusted experts.\n\nWith more than 2.8 million followers, fashion influencer and creative director Chriselle Lim is one such expert. She credits her TikTok success to things like: \n\nPosting consistently: Lim says posting at least three times a day increases how often her content is featured by the algorithm and reaches FYPs.\nUsing specific hashtags: Instead of using broad hashtags, she chooses long-tail keyword options that she wants to be known for, such as #feminineandproud and #bouncyskinisin.\nEngaging with her audience: Lim stays in touch with her audience by spending 10-15 minutes after each upload liking and responding to comments.\nParticipating in trends: Lim says this is how she was able to expand her audience. However, she urges creators to put their own spin on trends if they want to stand out.\n\nCreative lead and TikTok brand expert Nathan Allebach initially thought TikTok was a waste of time. He later realized how much it can help brands grow their businesses. \n\nAfter years of making successful TikTok videos and going viral more than once, Allebach recommends brands:\n\nExperiment with content. He made over 50 videos before eventually going viral.\nUnderstand TikTok culture. Get your finger on the pulse of TikTok trends. Who’s popular and why? What are the songs, memes, and lingo you see repeatedly? When is it right to use them?\nUse captions and hashtags effectively. Allebach recommends short in-video captions for that instant “aha moment” as users scroll. He believes the best use of hashtags is when you pair them with a relevant viral trend (e.g., #erastourtaylorswift).\n\nAt Semrush Academy, Brian Dean sat down with SEO consultant Lidia Infante to discuss TikTok SEO strategies for businesses. \n\nThe pair cover:\n\nWhy users are heading to TikTok to discover information\nThe rise of TikTok videos in Google search results\nHow TikTok SEO impacts your content strategy\nWhat it all means for the future of search\n\nTo better understand TikTok’s official (and unofficial) ranking factors, you need to see them in action. So get ready to experiment and immerse yourself in the platform with a new content strategy.\n\n5 Ways to Boost Your Profile Visibility with TikTok SEO\n\nWe’ve compiled five of the best TikTok SEO tips, inspired by brands that use these tactics successfully. \n\n1. Jump on Trends\n\nTikTok trends are a collection of popular elements that can make a video go viral, such as audio, filters, or filming/editing styles. \n\nFor example, this video uses a trending sound and “Wes Anderson” style:\n\nBy tapping on the vinyl image in the lower right corner, you can see this sound has been used in more than 34,000 videos shot in a similar style:\n\nIn this trend, creators use the same sound and a quirky style to showcase their own “day in the life” content, recipes, and more. \n\nTrends enable content creators to put their own spin on a popular element, and the result is content that’s both familiar and unique.\n\nTikTok was built on trends, and the platform rewards the brands that stay on top of them. But they move fast. It’s a race for marketers to stay consistent with both innovative and relevant content. \n\nOne of the most consistent ways to get more views on TikTok: use trending sounds with your own brand-specific take.\n\nOne brand that uses TikTok trends well is Shopify. \n\nThe ecommerce brand uses funny, educational content to inform and support its audience of entrepreneurs.\n\nFor example, Shopify uses a fun spin on the day-in-the-life content by showcasing an “entrepupneur.”\n\nHere’s what this video gets right:\n\nIt uses a trending type of content (day in the life)\nIt puts a unique spin on the trend using something interesting (and cute)\nIt uses on-screen text, which makes the video more accessible and telling the algorithm what the video is about\n\nIt does all of this while briefly promoting the Shopify platform and giving busy entrepreneurs a quick midday laugh, building affinity for the brand and helping it be more memorable.\n\nGrammarly is another brand using the platform well. In this TikTok video, the brand uses trending audio to highlight common filler phrases writers should avoid.\n\nThis video is appealing because:\n\nIt’s super short, but value-packed\nIt uses a trending sound in a way that’s on-brand\nIt makes the video more accessible for people and algorithms with on-screen text\n\nBy jumping on trends and aligning content with their brand, businesses such as Grammarly and Shopify increase their chances of profile visibility.\n\nNarrow Down Trends\n\nBrands need a comprehensive understanding of their markets to know which trends are right for their audience. There is no point in jumping on a dance trend if your audience doesn’t care about dance trends.\n\nTikTok’s built-in Audience Insights will tell you who is watching your videos, such as your audience’s demographics, which hashtags they’ve interacted with, and which ad categories they respond best to. \n\nFor even more insight into how your audience views your brand (or your competitors), use Semrush’s Media Monitoring tool:\n\nIt allows you to track mentions of your brand on social media, measure reach, track competitors’ mentions, view audience sentiments, and more. \n\nKey takeaways:\n\nCreate relevant content by using trending elements, such as sounds, styles, and filters\nExplore different trend types and experiment with what your audience might enjoy\nTrack success using insights and TikTok analytics tools\n2. Include Keywords and Hashtags\n\nKeyword research is essential for any successful SEO strategy, and TikTok SEO is no different. \n\nConsider Canva’s TikTok account. The brand does a great job of using keywords in its on-screen captions and post titles:\n\nWith the phrase “How to replace objects in images with Magic Edit,” the brand puts its content in front of people who are searching the term or who have shown interest in Canva’s features. \n\nThe team also includes “Magic Edit” in the post title and uses trendy audio to increase potential visibility (the post has more than 10,000 plays so far).\n\nAnd then there are hashtags. Unlike other platforms, more is not better. A handful of the most relevant hashtags should suffice: \n\nNeed ideas? You can use search to explore popular hashtags related to your content:\n\nIt’s important to note that more views doesn’t necessarily make a hashtag the better option for your brand. \n\nHashtags with higher views can also mean more competition. If you plan to use them, it’s best to use a mix of niche-specific hashtags and more popular, broader terms.\n\nTikTok provides a Keyword Insights tool where you can track popularity changes and click-through rates (CTR):\n\nIt’s primarily used for ad campaigns, but it’s at your disposal to research keywords for captions and hashtags.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nUse relevant keywords in your video titles, hashtags, captions, and spoken audio\nStick with just a few highly relevant hashtags\n3. Create Shareable Content\n\nFavorites and shares are user interactions that help organically boost your profile visibility—a ranking factor confirmed by TikTok.\n\nWhen a user taps the favorite button (via the bookmark icon), the post is added to their own personal content library. \n\nA user can also share a post by tapping the arrow to send the video to another user’s private message inbox, WhatsApp, Instagram, and more. \n\nTikTok also makes it easy to see how many users have liked, commented on, favorited, and shared each post.\n\nImage source: TikTok\n\nFenty Beauty is one brand consistently creating engaging content on the platform, like this makeup tutorial: \n\nEducational videos and tutorials are a great way to encourage your audience to favorite your content for later or share it with someone they know. \n\nUsers love to learn on the platform, but they also like to be entertained. Funny videos are often shared widely and get heaps of engagement.\n\nDuolingo is a brand committed to making its audience laugh, consistently gaining likes, favorites, and shares by the thousands. \n\nFor example, this funny little video has over 2,000 shares:\n\nThe key to creating shareable content is posting content that your audience enjoys. Find out what your target audience is looking for on TikTok to inform your strategy.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nFavorites and shares are key TikTok user interactions and will help boost your profile visibility\nYour audience will be more keen to favorite and share certain types of content, so learn what that’s more likely to be and experiment\n4. Engage With Your Audience\n\nComments—and likes on comments—are confirmed TikTok user interactions that contribute to your content landing on the FYP. \n\nThe TikTok algorithm recognizes conversations in the comments as a sign of how engaging the video is for users.\n\nReplying to comments encourages conversations and provides an opportunity to build a connection with users. Plus, other users will see the interaction and it may encourage them to interact, too.\n\nLook at Chipotle’s comment section:\n\nChipotle is a restaurant chain, but Alex is the representative replying to comments. This personal touch invited more likes and further comments, signaling to the algorithm that users enjoy the post.\n\nKey takeaways: \n\nReplying to and liking users’ comments can boost your visibility\nInteracting with commenters also forms relationships, turning users into fans\n5. Collaborate With Other TikTokers\n\nCollaboration with influencers is a fast track to more visibility, because you’ll bank their followers’ engagement and get discovered on another part of TikTok: the “Following” page.\n\nThere are several ways to collaborate with other accounts on TikTok:\n\nAppearing with another brand in a video\nUsing another brand’s product in your video\nAnother brand or influencer using your product in their video\nDuets (appearing alongside the influencer in a video)\n\nImage source: Advertisemint\n\nFor example, TikToker Zach King collaborated with McDonald’s. Now, when you search his name, the company’s name also shows up.\n\nCurious fans who’ve never seen the McDonald’s video may tap on the result to learn more.\n\nWhen influencers post about your brand, they may also mention it in post titles, hashtags, and captions, which all help to increase your profile visibility. They should also tag you in the post so users know where they can learn more.\n\nFor example, Guess’ most-viewed TikTok posts are sponsored posts with names like Camella La Compte: \n\nCamella has nearly 32,000 followers, making this video likely to be seen by tens of thousands of people who like her fashion content. Camella’s audience may even explore Guess’ page for more ideas.\n\nOne famous TikTok collaboration was between TikToker Charli D’Amelio and Dunkin’.\n\nBecause the popular TikToker is a huge iced coffee fan, Dunkin’ crafted a signature drink called “The Charli.” \n\nOnce Dunkin’ began promoting its collaboration, they saw a huge spike in business: 57% growth in app downloads, a 20% sales boost in iced coffee sales, and hundreds of thousands of Charli’s signature drinks sold in just one week. \n\nThis collaboration success was no accident. Charli had already amassed the exact audience that Dunkin’ wanted to target: female teenagers and young adults who love iced coffee. \n\nKey takeaways: \n\nInfluencer marketing can improve your chances of ranking on TikTok\nSeek out influencers who share your target audience to reach more like-minded users\nWhere Is TikTok SEO Headed?\n\nExperts predict a 9.3% global user growth rate for TikTok in 2024. This indicates that search on TikTok will grow alongside it.\n\nBut with that growth comes concern about brand safety. In other words, worries about the type of video your ads appear around (e.g., something explicit).\n\nTikTok is already making changes in response. For example, users can click “Why this video” to understand why they’ve been shown something. \n\nYou can also reset your “For You” feed and retrain the algorithm to further personalize your experience. \n\nThis provides plenty of fresh opportunities for brands to reach more targeted, engaged audiences trying to discover new content.\n\nTikTok is also trying to cement the future of the app with the rollout of:\n\nEcommerce feature TikTok Shop with plans for multiple U.S.-based fulfillment centers\nWellness-related features such as sleep reminders\nBetter accessibility for videos like scrubbing thumbnails\n\nThese updates and plans could indicate TikTok will be prioritizing product-focused, wellness-based, and accessible videos in the near future.\n\nTikTok won’t knock Google off its pedestal. But people are searching there, so you should aim to rank highly and capture more market share. Otherwise, your competition will.\n\nUse Semrush to Launch Your TikTok SEO Strategy\n\nTikTok keeps many of its algorithm secrets close to its chest. But these tried-and-trusted TikTok SEO strategies can help to consistently drive results for brand visibility.\n\nHowever, any marketing strategy worth its salt relies on audience research. \n\nStart yours by tracking audience sentiments around your brand and competitors using Semrush’s Media Monitoring tool.\n\nManage Your Social Media with Semrush\n\nStand out on multiple social media platforms with a strong strategy and the right tools.
