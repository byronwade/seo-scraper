  "content": "What Is Brand Awareness?\n\nBrand awareness is the degree to which your target audience recognizes and remembers your brand and its products or services. It takes into account brand recognition, recall, and market dominance.\n\nBrand awareness can be broken down into two main categories:\n\nAided awareness: The extent to which consumers can recognize a brand when prompted with its name or logo\nUnaided awareness: The likelihood that a brand will come to consumers’ minds when they’re thinking about a specific product or service category. Also known as top-of-mind awareness.\n\nGrowing brand awareness is important for aiding new, would-be customers in the first step of the buyer’s journey. These are the stages a customer goes through, from becoming aware of your brand to becoming a customer.\n\nImproving brand awareness, then, is also the first step to earning revenue. Because if someone isn’t aware of your brand, how will you convert them into a customer?\n\nWhy Is Measuring Brand Awareness Important?\n\nTracking brand awareness helps you understand how well you’re achieving your marketing or business goals. For example, to increase conversions, improve engagement, or enter a new market.\n\nSpecifically, measuring brand awareness helps you:\n\nUnderstand market position: Compare your level of brand awareness to your competitors’\nAssess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns: Measure changes to brand awareness over time to see whether your awareness campaigns are producing results\nGuide business and marketing decisions: Use insights from measuring brand awareness to influence company strategy\nImprove audience targeting: Measure brand awareness across different demographics to identify the groups familiar with your brand, and discover those who may not have heard of it yet\nGain insight into customer perception: Understand how well your brand resonates with your target audience\n9 Ways to Measure Brand Awareness\n1. Social Listening\n\nSocial listening lets you track brand mentions on social media, blogs, forums, or news websites. Helping you measure brand awareness on the basis of how often your brand is coming up in conversation.\n\nSocial listening also helps you understand audience sentiment, which is how people feel about and perceive your brand. \n\nFor example, say you’re a pizza restaurant that’s launched a new deep-pan crust. You use social listening to measure how many people mention your restaurant online. Which indicates brand awareness. \n\nAnd how they feel about your new pizza, which tells you audience sentiment.\n\nWhen using social listening, look at the following metrics:\n\nOverall brand mentions\nPositive brand mentions\nNegative brand mentions\nNeutral brand mentions\n\nUse a social listening tool like Media Monitoring to measure brand mentions, reach, awareness, and audience sentiment.\n\nFind Media Monitoring in the Semrush App Center, under \"Categories\" > \"Media Monitoring.\"\n\nTo get started, simply enter two branded keywords or hashtags. Select your language. Then, click “Create Project.”\n\nMedia Monitoring will look for mentions of your keywords and generate a report with its findings. \n\nFor example, the “Summary” tab shows your latest brand mentions. And a graph of mention volume by date. If this number is increasing, it’s an indication more people are becoming aware of your brand.\n\nLook at your “Presence” score to measure your brand’s popularity for a specified time frame. Use this metric to measure brand awareness and set benchmarks.\n\nClick the “Mentions” tab to review all your mentions sorted by date. And see the sentiment for each one. Including neutral, positive, and negative. \n\nClick on the “Analysis” tab to learn more about your reach and awareness. For example:\n\nMentions over a specific time period\nBrand reach (an estimate of how many impressions the posts featuring your brand have received)\nHow people feel about your business \nThe most influential websites that mention your brand\n\nTip\n\nYou can track your daily mentions and perform social listening with Brand Monitoring, also found in the Semrush App Center.\n\nMeasure Brand Mentions, Reach, Awareness, and Audience Sentiment\n\nwith the Semrush App Center\n\nExplore Now →\n2. Share of Voice\n\nShare of voice (SOV) measures how much your brand is seen or heard in the market compared to your competitors.\n\nThis helps you see:\n\nBrand presence: Understand how much of your market's attention your brand captures. For example, a business with high SOV could receive lots of media coverage or have an increased presence in search engine results pages (SERP).\nBrand position: Learn how your brand is positioned in the market and compare this against competitors. For example, a higher SOV could mean your brand is more well-known vs. other businesses in your market or industry. \nMarketing effectiveness: Use share of voice to assess the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns. Increasing your SOV may correlate with improved brand awareness, engagement, and consideration.\n\nMeasure your share of voice by comparing your website traffic, social followers/engagement, and paid advertising placements against competitors in your industry or market.\n\nThen, use that information to adjust your marketing strategy.\n\nFor example, if you notice that Competitor 3 has a higher SOV on social media than you, focus on improving your social media content strategy to increase your share of voice.\n\nTo find your website traffic share of voice metric, use Position Tracking. The tool helps you see SOV for your brand and competitors.\n\n3. Social Media KPIs\n\nTo measure brand awareness on social media, focus on the key performance indicators (KPIs) that tell you how well your target audience recognizes, remembers, and engages with your brand.\n\nLike:\n\nReach: The total number of unique users who saw a post in their feed\nImpressions: The total number of times a post is displayed on a user’s feed\nEngagement rate: Measures the number of engagements with a post relative to the total number of followers\nAudience growth rate: The increase or decrease in the number of followers your account has over a certain time period\nVideo views: The number of times users have seen your video content\n\nAn increase in these metrics signals that your brand awareness online is improving. This could be from paid social campaigns, influencer marketing, or organic social.\n\nUse a tool like Social Analytics to measure key social media metrics. Including engagement rate, follower growth, reach, and more. \n\nFirst, connect the accounts you want to analyze. Use our Social Analytics configuration guide for more on how to do this. \n\nOn the “Overview” tab, you’ll see a quick summary of your accounts and important metrics.\n\nChoose a social media channel to analyze. For example, click on “Facebook.” Then, click on the “Engagement” tab.\n\nHere, you’ll see impressions, reach, and engagement rate for that channel:\n\nTo measure your brand awareness over time, select a date range that reflects the duration of your recent efforts. For example, if you've been actively promoting awareness for six months, choose that.\n\nUse this information to set yourself a benchmark. \n\nThen, review your brand awareness at regular intervals (i.e., every quarter). And whenever you launch a new awareness initiative. For example, a Facebook advertising campaign that uses a carousel ad to show multiple images of your latest product launch.\n\nPro tip\n\nHaven’t set up your Facebook advertising account yet? Read how to promote your business on Facebook for the ultimate guide.\n\n4. Web Traffic\n\nMonitor web traffic to see how many people visit your site and where they came from.\n\nThis is similar to counting the number of visitors to a brick-and-mortar store. It gives you a clear indication of whether your brand awareness is improving or not.\n\nMeasure the following metrics:\n\nDirect traffic: Visitors who land on your site by typing the URL into their browser, using a bookmark, or clicking a link in an email\nReferral traffic: Visitors who land on your site via a link from another website\nOrganic traffic: Visitors who land on your site from search engine results pages\nOrganic social traffic: Visitors who land on your site from organic social media posts\nNew visitors: People visiting your site for the first time\nReturning visitors: Visitors who have visited your site before and are returning for a new visit\nPage views: The number of times visitors view pages on your website\nTime on site: The amount of time a visitor spends on your website in a session\n\nAn increase in traffic (for example, organic social traffic) indicates more people may be becoming aware of your business. And clicking through to your website.\n\nUse Google Analytics to measure web traffic. The platform helps you quickly set up and analyze web traffic from various sources.\n\nPro tip\n\nRead Google Analytics for Beginners: Getting Started with GA4 to learn how to set up and measure your web traffic.\n\n5. Search Engine Visibility\n\nSearch engine visibility assesses your brand’s presence in search results when people look for keywords relevant to your business. It helps you gauge the effectiveness of your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts.\n\nMeasure the following metrics to understand how search engine visibility impacts your brand awareness:\n\nKeyword rankings: The position your website occupies in the SERP for a specific keyword\nOrganic click-through rate (CTR): The number of visitors who click on your result in the SERP after seeing it\nBranded keywords: Keywords that include your brand’s name or a variation of it\nBranded organic traffic: Visitors who land on your website from the SERP after searching for a branded keyword\nAuthority Score: A Semrush metric that indicates the quality and trustworthiness of your website based on its backlinks, content quality, site structure, and other elements\n\nUse Domain Overview to see where your domain ranks for various keywords.\n\nSimply input your domain name, set your location, and click “Search.”\n\nThe “Overview” tab reports your domain’s performance across various SEO metrics. Scroll down to “Organic Keywords” to see how your domain ranks in Google over time.\n\nAn increase indicates that more people have potentially become aware of your business.\n\nScroll down to “Branded vs. Non-Branded Traffic” to see how much estimated traffic your site gets from branded keywords. This tells you how much brand awareness you have among people searching on Google.\n\nGet Insights into Your Rankings\n\nwith the Domain Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n6. Conversions\n\nAs your brand awareness increases, so should your revenue. \n\nAs audiences get more familiar with your brand, there’s more opportunity for them to start progressing through your marketing funnel. And the more potential customers that enter the funnel at the top, the more can become a customer at the conversion stage. \n\nA conversion is a predetermined action that’s valuable to your business. For example, purchasing a product, signing up for a course, joining a newsletter, or downloading a resource.\n\nConversions can’t happen without awareness building first. So, measuring your conversion rate over time can help you understand the impact of brand awareness campaigns.\n\nConversions could come from:\n\nPay-per-click (PPC) ads: Digital advertising where companies pay each time their ad is clicked\nPaid social ads: Social media content paid to reach an audience broader than your following\nContent marketing: The creation and distribution of content (e.g., blog posts, whitepapers, ebooks, or webinars) that engage your target audience\nEmail marketing: Sending email campaigns to a targeted or segmented group of subscribers\n\nUse Google Analytics to see conversion rates on your website. You’ll need to set up conversion tracking first by creating events.\n\nThen, navigate to GA4 and go to “Reports” > “Lifecycle” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”\n\nThen, click on the pencil icon in the upper-right corner.\n\nFind “Metrics.”\n\nThen, click “Add metric.” And look for “Session key event rate.” Then, click “Apply.”\n\nYou should now see “Session conversion rate” in your “Traffic acquisition report.”\n\nHere, you can see the conversion rate for each channel. Which helps you know which areas to focus your marketing efforts on.\n\nFor example, if organic search generates a higher conversion rate than organic social, consider whether you need to double down on your SEO strategy to continue this trend.\n\n7. Customer Surveys and Reviews\n\nMeasure brand awareness by getting direct feedback from your customers and audience. \n\nUse a survey to ask questions about brand recognition and familiarity. For example, you could show an image of your brand logo and ask if customers recognize it and where they saw it.\n\nOr create a survey about how customers perceive your brand and its reputation to gain a deeper understanding of your brand image. \n\nAlternatively, use a Net Promoter Score (NPS). \n\nNPS gives you an indication of customer loyalty. And how likely a customer is to spread word-of-mouth recommendations about your brand. Which is a positive reflection of brand awareness improving.\n\nNPS surveys often ask direct questions, such as “How likely are you to recommend our product/service to a friend or colleague?”\n\nThe survey responses are then broken down into three groups:\n\nPromoters (scores of 9-10): Enthusiastic, happy, and loyal customers who are likely to promote your brand to others\nPassives (scores of 7-8): Satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who could be tempted by a competitor's offering\nDetractors (scores of 0-6): Unhappy customers who can damage the brand through negative word-of-mouth\n\nAn NPS score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters: NPS = % Promoters − % Detractors\n\nFor example, you survey 100 customers. 50% are promoters, 30% are passives, and 20% are detractors. Your NPS score would be 30.\n\nNPS scores vary by industry, but scores of 0 or less signal customer satisfaction issues that need to be immediately addressed. A score of 30+ is considered good, and 50+ is excellent.\n\nPro tip\n\nPlatforms like Delighted can help you send NPS surveys and track feedback.\n\nYou’ll also want to track your reviews and star ratings on third-party websites like Yelp and Google. \n\nLook at your average star rating. A high score indicates a positive brand reputation. And an increase in the volume of customer ratings could also mean that more people are becoming aware of your brand. \n\n8. Influencer Impact\n\nIf your brand collaborates with influencers, measure the impact of their posts on your brand’s awareness. \n\nThe KPIs and benchmarks for influencer marketing will depend on what you’re looking to achieve by partnering with influencers. For example, are you looking to generate leads or brand awareness?\n\nHere are some common KPIs to measure the impact of influencer campaigns on brand awareness:\n\nEngagement rate\nLeads captured\nWebsite traffic\n\nDepending on your goal, make sure you set your influencer campaign up for success by ensuring you can measure the results. \n\nFor example, give each influencer a UTM tracking code to the link they share on their social post. Then, measure the increase in clicks to your website from that link using Google Analytics.\n\nOr use Social Analytics by Semrush to measure influencer post engagement rates, reach, impressions, and more. And get insights into how your influencers' campaigns are improving brand awareness or generating a positive return on investment (ROI).\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s Influencer Analytics app to measure the impact of your influencer marketing campaigns.\n\n9. Media Impressions\n\nKeep track of the number of times your brand’s content is shared across digital media platforms. This metric highlights the potential reach of your brand’s messages and can tell you how well your public relations (PR) campaigns are performing.\n\nTo measure brand awareness in media, use Media Monitoring. This tool keeps track of all media mentions across the web.\n\nThen, look at what backlinks your brand has. Backlinks are links on a website that point to another website. Google values these backlinks and sees them as a sign of trust—another brand or website has vouched for you.\n\nUse Backlink Analytics for a comprehensive view of your backlink profile.\n\nMeasuring Brand Awareness Across Multiple Channels\n\nFor brand awareness to be effective, it needs to occur across multiple channels. Including organic, paid, and social. \n\nThis is where Semrush can help. Semrush tools give you data-rich insights into your SEO, PPC, social media, PR campaigns, and more to understand the impact of your marketing efforts on increasing brand awareness.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
