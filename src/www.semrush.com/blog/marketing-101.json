  "content": "If you're new to marketing, it's important to understand the basics.\n\nThat’s exactly what you’ll get in this article: a comprehensive marketing 101 discussion.\n\nLet’s start.\n\nWhat Is Marketing?\n\nMarketing is the process of attracting potential customers to your products or services. And involves understanding your audience’s wants, creating value for them, and building long-term relationships.\n\nThe purpose of marketing is to:\n\nCreate brand awareness\nGenerate leads (qualified prospects)\nConvert leads into customers\nFoster loyalty that leads to repeat business\nDrive revenue\nDigital Marketing vs. Traditional Marketing\n\nTraditional marketing focuses on reaching audiences through offline channels. Such as print ads, billboards, TV commercials, and direct mail.\n\nDigital marketing uses online channels like social media, search engines, and emails to reach prospects. \n\nWhile traditional marketing is still relevant (particularly for growing brand awareness), digital marketing offers more precise targeting, can be more accurately measured, and is easier to scale.\n\nFor example, we know from Traffic Analytics data that the Semrush website attracts over 33 million monthly visitors. And that many of them come via digital marketing efforts.\n\nAnalyze Any Site’s Traffic\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nWhat Are the Fundamental Elements in Marketing?\n\nProfessor E. Jerome McCarthy introduced the four Ps framework (product, price, place, and promotion) in the book “Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach” in 1960. To outline the key elements that impact your marketing strategy.\n\nBut it’s equally relevant for modern marketing. Because you need to have a deep understanding of these elements to meet customer needs and business goals.\n\nSo, let’s go over them:\n\nProduct (or Service)\n\nProduct or service refers to what you’re offering to the market. And who you’re trying to reach. \n\nAs a marketer, you must understand your products or services well—the benefits, features, etc.—so you can:\n\nCommunicate why you’re better than competitors\nCommunicate customer expectations (or gaps) to other relevant teams at your company\n\nBecause marketing is as much about co-creating and improving your product or service as it is about communicating its benefits to customers. \n\nPrice\n\nPricing is how much your products or services will cost. And it’s important to get it right.\n\nIf your prices are too high, customers might find them unaffordable.\n\nBut if your prices are too low, customers may think what you offer isn’t of good quality.\n\nSo, you must strike a balance to attract customers while also ensuring profitability. \n\nSome other factors that influence pricing decisions include production costs, market demand, and competitor pricing.\n\nPlace\n\nPlace refers to where customers can find and buy your products or services. Which could be online, at a physical location, or both.\n\nFor instance, consider a company that sells both high-end athletic apparel and budget-friendly activewear. \n\nTheir high-end line targets affluent consumers. So, they might have boutique stores in upscale shopping districts for that product line. \n\nBut for their budget line, placing those products in big-box retailers and discount chains makes more sense.\n\nPromotion\n\nPromotion is about reaching your customers:\n\nAt the right time: For example, promoting skiing gear makes most sense during the pre-season (when skiing enthusiasts plan their ski trips). And during the peak season (when active skiers may need new equipment or replacements).\nAt the right place: For example, if your target audience is senior executives, LinkedIn could be a better social platform than TikTok\nWith the right message: For example, a user who just signed up for your free software plan will probably be more receptive to emails linking to tutorials than to prompts to upgrade their plan \n\nWith the right approach to promotion, you can effectively engage your audience. And drive better results from your marketing efforts.\n\nWhat Are Some Key Digital Marketing Channels?\n\nTo optimize your reach and audience engagement, use a combination of marketing channels that aligns with your audience’s preferences.\n\nHere’s an overview of some of the popular marketing channels: \n\nSearch Engine Marketing\n\nSearch engine marketing (SEM) is about promoting your brand, website, or products on search engines. So you can reach people actively searching for topics related to your brand.\n\nThere are two ways to do this: search engine optimization (SEO) and pay-per-click (PPC) advertising.\n\nWhen potential customers use search, they can see both types of results. \n\nOrganic (SEO) results are those the search engine deemed highly relevant to the search terms. Paid results include search ads companies paid to show in the sponsored section. \n\nThis is what paid and organic results look like:\n\nIt may take time to see significant results from SEO. But it can give you exponential and recurring traffic (as well as revenue) in the long run.\n\nBut PPC can provide more immediate visibility and traction.\n\nSo, it’s a good idea to combine both. And you can get started by conducting keyword research.\n\nHere’s how you can do that with Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool. \n\nLaunch the tool, enter a term related to your business, enter your domain to see personalized data for your site, and hit “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see data such as:\n\nVolume: The average number of monthly searches for the keyword\nKeyword Difficulty: A measure of how difficult it is to rank for the specified term\nPersonal Keyword Difficulty: A measure of how difficult it is for your specific site to rank for the specified term\nIntent: The main reason or motivation behind the search query\nTrend: How search volume has changed over the last 12 months\n\nScroll down to the “Keyword ideas” widget. \n\nYou’ll see:\n\nKeyword Variations: Keywords related to the target query\nQuestions: Related questions or phrases people frequently search online\nKeyword Strategy: An AI-generated personalized content plan for your site\n\nClick the corresponding “View all” link in these sections to get some more specific keyword ideas you can leverage for your SEO and PPC efforts. \n\nAnalyze Keywords’ Value and Competition\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nSocial Media Marketing\n\nSocial media marketing refers to using social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and TikTok to connect with your audience.\n\nOver 5 billion people (nearly 63% of the world’s population) use social media. This makes it a crucial marketing channel for pretty much any business.\n\nJust like with search engines, you can reach your audience in two ways: organic social and paid social. \n\nHere’s an example of organic content from GoPro: \n\nBy sharing engaging content like this, you help build brand loyalty. And drive traffic to your website. \n\nYou can also use social platforms to advertise your products and services. \n\nFor instance, LinkedIn Ads can be very effective for B2B companies. \n\nTake a look at this LinkedIn ad from Mixpanel (product analytics software). \n\nWhen you’re ready to get started, use Semrush Social to manage your social profiles, track competitors’ strategies, and monitor important KPIs. \n\nEmail Marketing\n\nEmail marketing involves sending emails to subscribers to showcase valuable content, promote new products/services, etc. And it tends to generate great returns. \n\nResearch from Litmus shows email marketing generates between $32 and $45 for each dollar spent.\n\nSome common email types include:\n\nWelcome emails: To greet new subscribers or buyers. And set expectations for future interactions.\nPromotional emails: To inform customers about special deals or new product launches. These can help you increase sales.\nNewsletters: To keep your audience informed about your business, industry developments, or other initiatives\nRe-engagement emails: To re-capture the attention of subscribers who’ve stopped interacting with you\n\nHere’s an example of a welcome email from cat food brand Smalls: \n\nImage Source: Really Good Emails\n\nFollow these tips for effective email marketing:\n\nPersonalize your emails by using the recipient’s name and tailoring the content to their interests. You can do that with email automation tools like MailChimp and ConvertKit.\nWrite compelling subject lines to increase open rates. And leverage creative body copy to grab your audience’s attention.\nSegment your email list based on subscribers’ demographics, behavior, or preferences for precise targeting\nInclude clear calls to action (CTAs) that guide recipients to take the next step\nEnsure your emails are mobile-friendly. Because many users read emails on their phones.\n\nFurther reading: Top 10 Email Marketing Platforms for 2024\n\nNote\n\nThere are many other effective marketing channels such as podcasts, videos, and events. Learn more about them in this detailed blog post on marketing channels. \n\n5 Marketing Tips to Get Started\n1.
