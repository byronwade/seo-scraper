  "content": "Facebook advertising is a low-cost way to grow your business using social media.\n\nFollow this guide to learn how to advertise on Facebook in eight easy steps.\n\nWhat Is Facebook Advertising?\n\nAdvertising on Facebook is when a business pays to promote its products or services to Facebook’s user base.\n\nFacebook allows businesses to target ads to users based on specific information such as interests, gender, and location.\n\nThis makes it easy to get your business in front of people who are most likely to be interested in your product or service.\n\nRunning a Facebook advertisement is a form of social media advertising.\n\nBusinesses manage Facebook campaigns in Ads Manager. Which is a built-in tool on the Facebook platform.\n\nBelow is an example of Facebook advertising. The advert promotes the Captain Whidbey Inn near Seattle, Washington.\n\nWe know this is a Facebook ad because it says “Sponsored” in the top left corner.\n\nWhy Advertise on Facebook?\n\nFacebook boasts over 2 million daily active users (DAU) and is one of the world's most popular social media platforms.\n\nThis means that advertising on Facebook can potentially reach a large, diverse audience.\n\nHere’s a chart from Statista showing Facebook’s DAU count from Q3 2008 to Q2 2023.\n\nNotice how the chart shows long-term, stable growth?\n\nThis clearly indicates to advertisers that Facebook is a reliable platform to invest time and resources in because their user base keeps increasing.\n\nAnd thanks to Facebook’s high number of customer touchpoints, there are various opportunities to advertise your business on the platform.\n\nFor example, advertise on Facebook via Marketplace, Messenger, or the Facebook homepage.\n\nThis allows you to place ad campaigns where your potential customers will most likely see and engage with them, which helps you grow your business.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost to Advertise on Facebook?\n\nFacebook advertising is a low-cost way to promote your business.\n\nThe amount you spend on Facebook advertising will depend on various factors, including:\n\nSocial media goals\nSocial media budget\nCampaign objectives\nAd placement\nCampaign duration \nSeasonality \n\nAdvertisers typically measure the success of Facebook paid advertising campaigns by measuring cost per click (CPC).\n\nThis metric tells advertisers how much they spent for each ad click.\n\nAs of January 2024, the average cost per click on Facebook was $0.55.\n\nImage Source: Revealbot\n\nHowever, Facebook ad costs can differ depending on the industry.\n\nFor example, IT and software companies generally have the highest cost per click at $0.85.\n\nWhereas food products and other services have a lower CPC—around $0.18.\n\nFacebook calculates cost per click by dividing the total cost of an ad by the total number of clicks.\n\nThe CPC formula looks like this:\n\nCost per click = total ad cost / total number of clicks \n\nWhat Are the Different Types of Facebook Ads?\n\nThere are several types of Facebook ads to use to promote your business.\n\nLet’s look at each ad format and explain the best use to help create successful advertising campaigns on Facebook.\n\nImage Ads\n\nImage ads are one of the most basic forms of advertising on Facebook. The ad consists of a single photo, ad copy, and a call to action (CTA).\n\nCreate a new image ad using Ads Manager or create one from an existing post on your Facebook Business Page. Which is known as a boosted post.\n\nUse image ads to promote your product or service and convince people to take action. For example, click a button to shop your store or call your business.\n\nHere’s a Facebook image ad example from fitness brand Peloton:\n\nIn this ad example, the call to action encourages the ad viewer to “Shop now.” This aligns with the ad’s copy that tells the audience Peloton is having a sale.\n\nVideo Ads\n\nVideo ads promote your product or service using video. Like image ads, you create a video ad in Ads Manager or boost an existing post.\n\nOr record your own video ad and upload it to Facebook.\n\nVideo ads are highly engaging and capture an audience's attention. They also allow you to share a single, clear message in an easily digestible format.\n\nHere’s a screenshot from a Facebook video ad from women’s cycling brand Samsara:\n\nVideo also helps tell a story and connect with your target audience emotionally.\n\nUse video to showcase product demos, provide tutorials or how-to content, or show a behind-the-scenes look at your business.\n\nFacebook video ads can be as long as 240 minutes. Or as short as one second.\n\nThe length of your Facebook ad will depend on the placement on the platform.\n\nFor example, ads on Facebook Marketplace can run for the full 240 minutes. In contrast, Facebook Stories ads can be between one and 15 seconds long.\n\nCarousel Ads\n\nCarousel ads give you space to share up to 10 images or videos the audience can swipe through.\n\nEach image or video has its own headline, description, and button. Meaning that you’ll convey a lot of information in one advertisement.\n\nUse carousel ads to showcase a variety of products or features, provide updates, tell a story, or highlight multiple features of one product. \n\nHere is an example of a carousel ad from fashion company Topo Designs:\n\nCollection Ads\n\nCollection ads on Facebook are designed to turn casual browsers into passionate buyers.\n\nThe ad format includes a main feature image or video and three smaller images beneath in a grid. \n\nUsers who tap and browse your collection ad will be directed to an immersive Instant Experience designed to generate further engagement with your brand.\n\nHere’s an example of a collection ad by Spruce:\n\nCollection ads are especially useful for ecommerce businesses and merchants who can use collection ads to drive purchases from a catalog.\n\nFurther reading: How to Create an Ecommerce Facebook Ads Strategy\n\nInstant Experience Ads (Formerly Canvas Ads)\n\nInstant Experience ads are full-screen Facebook advertisements optimized for mobile browsing.\n\nDesigned to capture audience attention, Instant Experience ads open after a viewer taps on the ad.\n\nUse Instant Experience ads to create an engaging visual experience, tell a story about your brand, and deep dive into your message by linking two or more Instant Experience ads together.\n\nHere’s an example of an Instant Experience ad by Skoda:\n\nPoll Ads\n\nPoll ads allow you to survey your target audience with a two-answer poll.\n\nUse polls to ask your audience questions or gain insight into how they feel about a topic or your latest product.\n\nHere’s an example of a poll ad by Novo Nordisk: \n\nThis helps you learn more about your target audience. Use the information from your poll to help shape future campaigns.\n\nSlideshow Ads\n\nSlideshow ads are a looping sequence of three to 10 images or one video.\n\nUse slideshow ads to communicate a story, showcase your products or services, and simplify a complex message.\n\nSlideshow ads are a good alternative to video ads. Which can be expensive to produce.\n\nAnd because slideshow ads can use up to five times less data than video, the ad format is useful to reach audiences with slower internet speeds. Like this ad from Charter College:\n\nStories Ads\n\nStories ads are highly engaging, interactive, full-screen, vertical images or videos in Facebook’s Story feed.\n\nInclude clear visuals and a compelling narrative to use Facebook Stories to improve brand awareness and generate interest in your product or service. \n\nInclude a call to action in your story and direct a viewer to a landing page for further engagement with your business. Like Tropicana does here:\n\nLead Ads\n\nLead ads collect information from a viewer and offer an opportunity for audiences to engage deeper with a business and continue on their journey to become a customer.\n\nLead ads will include a call to action. For example, sign up, request a demo, or register. \n\nThe viewer then inputs information. Which creates the lead. \n\nUse leads to grow your business and scale an email list (if you have one). \n\nSync lead ads with your customer relationship management (CRM) system to ensure an effective follow-up.\n\nMessenger Ads\n\nMessenger Ads appear in the Chats tab on Facebook’s Messenger app. \n\nWhen a viewer taps on a listed ad, a detailed view automatically opens in Messenger containing your ad details.\n\nWhen creating Messenger ads, include images, ad copy, and a CTA. Which helps drive engagement and interaction.\n\nUse the ad format ideal to create conversation, drive clicks to your store, and strengthen customer relationships.\n\nTip\n\nTo quickly generate branded and conversion-focused ad creatives for Facebook, check out the AdCreative.ai app in the Semrush App Center.\n\n\nHow to Advertise on Facebook\n\nGenerate Ad Creatives\n\nwith Ad Creative.ai\n\nTry It Today →\n\nTo start seeing results from Facebook advertising, you need a Business Page. \n\nManage your Facebook Page using Meta Business Manager. \n\nWhich is a built-in tool for businesses to organize, manage, and control their business assets on Facebook.\n\nIf you already have a Facebook Business Page, skip ahead to Step Three. \n\nIf you don’t, follow the steps below:\n\nLog in to your personal account and navigate to the left sidebar. Click “Pages.”\n\nThen, click “Create New Page.”\n\nFollow the onscreen instructions to add Business Page information such as page name, category, and a short description of what you do.\n\nNext, click “Create Page.”\n\nFurther reading: How to Promote Your Business on Facebook\n\nStep 2: Navigate to Ads Manager\n\nOnce you’ve set up your page, navigate to the left side of your screen. \n\nClick “Ads Manager.”\n\nAds Manager is the dashboard where you create, manage, and monitor your Facebook advertising campaigns. \n\nYou’ll visit this page often while using Facebook to advertise, so bookmark or save the Ads Manager URL for future reference.\n\nTo start building your Facebook ad, click the green “+ Create” button in the top-center of the Ads Manager screen.\n\nStep 3. Choose a Campaign Objective\n\nNext, choose your campaign objective. \n\nThis must relate to your social media goals. Otherwise, you’ll struggle to prove a positive return on investment (ROI) from advertising on Facebook.\n\nFor example, if your goal is to increase brand awareness using social media, don’t set a Facebook campaign objective to make sales. \n\nBecause these objectives drive different results. \n\nSo, it can be difficult to create the results you need to achieve your social media goals.\n\nIf you haven’t set any social media goals, start with the SMART framework:\n\nSpecific: What do you want to achieve? \n\nMeasurable: Can you track and report on ad campaign metrics? \n\nAchievable: Will you achieve the goal in your time frame? \n\nRelevant: How does this goal support business objectives?\n\nTime-bound: What is the timeline for the ad campaign?\n\nLet’s look at each Facebook campaign objective in more detail:\n\nAwareness\n\nThe awareness objective helps improve brand recognition and introduces your business to a new audience. \n\nChoose this objective to:\n\nReach new potential customers\nIncrease your target audience’s awareness of your brand\nShare video content with an engaged audience\nTraffic\n\nThe traffic objective sends ad viewers to an online destination predetermined by you. For example, a website, landing page, app, or event.\n\nChoose this objective to:\n\nIncrease social media traffic to your website\nSend ad viewers to a landing page\nDirect audiences to other Meta products (e.g., Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger)\nGet people to call your business\nEngagement\n\nComments, likes, shares, and saves are all forms of engagement that tell Facebook your audience is interested in your ad.\n\nWhich helps them perform better on the platform.\n\nChoose this objective to:\n\nIncrease audience interaction and engagement with your ad\nGet your audience to take action\nIncrease video views\nGenerate responses to an event\nLeads\n\nRunning a lead-generation ad campaign on Facebook lets you capture high-quality information from potential customers.\n\nChoose this objective to:\n\nGrow your customer base and build connections\nAcquire phone numbers and email addresses\nExpand registrations for an event\n\nFurther reading: Getting Low-Quality Leads from Your Facebook Ads? Here's What to Do\n\nApp Promotion\n\nIf you’ve got a new app to launch, running an app promotion campaign will help you gain more downloads and customers.\n\nFor example, if you’re a new grocery delivery app, you could use the app promotion campaign objective to increase downloads of your new product.\n\nChoose this objective to:\n\nIncrease downloads of your app\nOptimize your ad with App Events for deeper customer insights and targeting\nDrive high-value purchases\nIncrease link clicks to your app\nSales\n\nSales are a key driver of business revenue.\n\nThe sales campaign objective lets you target people who are likely to make a purchase. Or, perform an action—like putting an item in their basket.\n\nChoose this objective to:\n\nGain more customers and increase revenue\nFocus on conversions\nEncourage purchase from a catalog\n\nChoose the campaign objective that best fits your social media goal. Then, click “Continue.”\n\nIn this example, we’ve selected the traffic campaign objective. With the goal to increase calls to a fictional pizza parlor called Mario’s Pizza Seattle.\n\nStep 4. Create Your Ad Campaign\n\nFill out the specific details of your campaign, starting with the campaign name.\n\nThe campaign name should reference the product or service you’re advertising, the campaign objective, and the date.\n\nNext, clarify if your ad falls under Facebook’s special ad categories (e.g., finance, education, politics, etc.).\n\nAnd confirm the buying type and campaign objective.\n\nNow, you have the option to create an A/B test. Which is a research method that compares two versions of a Facebook ad to determine the one that performs better.\n\nFor now, we’ll leave this unchecked.\n\nIf you’re creating multiple Facebook ads, activate the Advantage campaign budget. But for now, we can also leave this turned off.\n\nThen, click “Next” to name your ad set.\n\nAn ad set is a group of ads that share the same setting. For example, audience or location.\n\nThen, choose the location you want to drive traffic to.\n\nFor the traffic campaign objective, choose between a website, an app, messaging apps (WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), or calls.\n\nWe want more calls for our pizza business, so we’ll select that option. \n\nStep 5. Set Your Ad Budget and Schedule\n\nNext, you need to set your ad budget.\n\nHow much money you allocate from your social media budget to Facebook advertising will depend on:\n\nYour campaign goals\nHow your Facebook audience buys\nHow many people managing ad campaigns\nYour ad campaign duration\n\nThere are two types of Facebook ad budgets:\n\nDaily Budget\n\nA daily budget has a limit on the amount you spend each day advertising your business on Facebook. \n\nBy setting a daily budget, the platform will show an ad to your target audience when and where they’re most likely to engage.\n\nOnce your budget is reached, your ad stops running for the day. And starts again the next day.\n\nLifetime Budget\n\nA lifetime budget is the total amount you’ll spend during the entire duration of your ad campaign. \n\nProvide Facebook with details on a start and end date, and the platform will allocate the money based on the performance of your ad. \n\nOnce your budget is reached, the ad campaign will finish.\n\nAs a starting point, we recommend beginning with a small ad budget to help you test your Facebook ad’s effectiveness.\n\nIf the ad is successful, scale it to meet your campaign goals.\n\nChoose whether you want to run a daily or lifetime budget, enter your budget amounts, and schedule the duration of your campaign.\n\nStep 6. Customize Your Target Audience\n\nFor your Facebook advertisement to be effective, it needs to be placed in front of an audience most likely to be interested in your product or service.\n\nOtherwise, you’ll struggle to drive engagement. And your campaigns won’t generate results.\n\nTo get inside the minds of consumers and understand what engages them, you need to conduct audience research to uncover specific demographics, behaviors, and characteristics.\n\nThis way, you’ll create Facebook advertising campaigns that resonate.\n\nUse Semrush’s Audience Intelligence Tool to get an accurate picture of your target audience.\n\nThe tool helps identify and gain insights by examining audience demographics, interests, content engagement, online habits, and purchase behavior.\n\nThis allows you to build helpful profiles of who you should target in your ad content.\n\nTo create a new audience for your Facebook advertisement, follow these steps:\n\nLocations: Choose a relevant location to target with your ad campaign. For example, our fictional pizza place, Mario’s, is located in Seattle, so that’s an obvious city for them to target.\n\nAge and gender: Set the age and gender of your target audience. For Mario’s, we’ve chosen men aged 18-35.\n\nDetailed targeting: Enter the interests of your target audience. In Mario’s case, pizza.\n\nIt’s important to include as much information about your target audience as possible. This will help build ad campaigns that achieve results.\n\nFor example, if your target audience speaks more than one language, add this information.\n\nNext, look to the side of the screen. Facebook provides information on: \n\nAudience definition: How specific or broad your audience targeting is\nEstimate audience size: The number of people you could reach with your daily budget\nEstimated results: The expected daily results from your campaign\n\nRemember—these are daily estimates, so your actual results may vary.\n\nIf you’re happy with your estimates, click “Next.”\n\nGet Audience Insights\n\nwith the Audience Intelligence tool\n\nTry It Today →\nStep 7. Design and Finalize Your Ad\n\nNow, it’s time to name your ad.\n\nIt’s best practice to include information about the design of your Facebook ad. For example, image use and copy information.\n\nNext, confirm the identity of the Facebook page you’ll run ad campaigns on.\n\nThen, choose the format of your ad. For example, a single image or video, carousel, or collection.\n\nNext, scroll down to the “Ad creative” section.\n\nThis is where you’ll add creative and interactive elements to your ad. For example, images, videos, ad copy, and a call to action.\n\nClick “Add media.”\n\nSelect the image or video you want to include in your Facebook ad. Then, click “Next.”\n\nNow, add the copy that will appear alongside your Facebook advertisement. \n\nFacebook ad copy is one of the most important elements of your ad. It needs to be engaging, hook the audience, and explain what you’re advertising.\n\nLuckily, Facebook makes writing ad copy easy by breaking it down into three elements:\n\nPrimary text: Appears above the ad creative (e.g., images or video). Use 125 characters or less for the best impact.\nHeadline: Appears below the ad creative. Use 40 characters or less.\nDescription: Appears just below the headline. Use 30 characters or less.\n\nIn this example from running shoe company On, we can see they’ve leveraged their Facebook copy perfectly to promote their weatherproof shoe. \n\nAnd they encourage the audience to engage further with their brand by including a CTA (“Shop now”).\n\nBut starting from a blank page is hard. If you need support writing Facebook ad copy, use Semrush’s AI Writing Assistant.\n\nThe tool helps generate creative ideas, checks for spelling and grammar, and uses AI to align your ad copy with your brand voice, tone, and target audience.\n\nHere’s the Facebook ad copy we’ve added for Mario’s:\n\nPrimary text: Dial Mario’s for a slice of the good stuff. Delivered straight to you. No fees, no fuss. BOGO every Tuesday!\nHeadline: Mario’s Pizza Seattle\nDescription: NY-slice on the West Coast\n\nThis ad copy works because:\n\nPrimary text: Includes a catchy opening slogan, tells the audience Mario’s delivers for no fee, and explains the deal they’re promoting (buy one, get one every Tuesday).\n\nHeadline: States the name of the business. \n\nDescription: Includes a short description of the business and its place in the market.\n\nFor our chosen campaign objective (traffic), we need to set a destination for our viewers after they engage with our ad.\n\nBecause we selected our conversion destination as calls, we have the option to enter our phone number. \n\nNext, preview your ad. \n\nYou’ll see how your ad will appear in Facebook feeds, Stories and Reels, and search results.\n\nConfirm that your ad is correct, then hit “Publish.”\n\nCongratulations! You’ve just learned how to create a Facebook ad.\n\nCraft Compelling Content\n\nwith the AI writing Assistant\n\nTry It Today →\nStep 8. Measure the Results of Your Facebook Ad Campaign\n\nOnce your Facebook ads are running, you need to keep an eye on how they perform.\n\nUse Ads Manager to understand how your campaign helps achieve your goals.\n\nTo do this, navigate to Facebook Ads Manager. \n\nAnd click “Ads reporting.”\n\nThe dashboard will show a detailed report of your ad campaign. And allows you to see key performance metrics at a glance. \n\nIncluding:\n\nReach: the number of accounts that saw your ads at least once\nImpressions: the number of times your ad is shown to accounts (regardless of whether they see it)\nResults: the results of your ad. For example, the number of link clicks. \nAmount spent: how much you spent on the ad campaign\nCost-per-result: measures the cost-effectiveness of your ad campaign\n\nImage Source: MarTech\n\nUse this information to understand how your Facebook ad campaign is performing.\n\nFurther reading: 18 Social Media KPIs (and How to Track Them)\n\nFacebook Advertising: Best Practices\nUnderstand Facebook Ad Specs\n\nImages and videos form the backbone of many Facebook ad campaigns. \n\nSo, these creative elements must be accurate. \n\nAnd because your Facebook advertisement represents your business, you don’t want to include blurry images or wonky videos.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with Facebook ad specs to ensure you upload the right creative file types and sizes:\n\nFacebook Image Ad Specs\n\nFile type: JPG or PNG \nRatio: 1.91:1 to 1:1 \nResolution: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels \n\nPrimary text: 125 characters \nHeadline: 27 characters \nDescription: 27 characters \n\nMaximum file size: 30 MB\nMinimum width: 600 pixels\nMinimum height: 600 pixels\n\nHere’s an example of a Facebook image ad by Good Protein:\n\nFacebook Video Ad Specs\n\nFile type: MP4, MOV or GIF \nRatio: 1:1 (for desktop or mobile) or 4:5 (for mobile only) \nVideo settings: H.264 compression, square pixels, fixed frame rate, progressive scan, and stereo AAC audio compression at over 128 kbps\nResolution: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters \nHeadline: 27 characters \nDescription: 27 characters \n\nVideo duration: 1 second to 241 minutes\nMaximum file size: 4 GB\nMinimum width: 120 pixels\nMinimum height: 120 pixels\n\nHere’s a Facebook video ad from Goodfood:\n\nFacebook Carousel Ad Specs\n\nImage file type: JPG or PNG \nVideo file type: MP4, MOV or GIF \nRatio: 1:1 \nResolution: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels \n\nPrimary text: 125 characters \nHeadline: 32 characters \nDescription: 18 characters \n\nNumber of carousel cards: 2 to 10\nImage maximum file size: 30 MB\nVideo maximum file size: 4 GB\nVideo duration: 1 second to 240 minutes\n\nHere’s a carousel ad example by Upside Drinks:\n\nFacebook Collection Ad Specs\n\nImage type: JPG or PNG \nVideo file type: MP4, MOV or GIF \nRatio: 1:1 \nResolution: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels \n\nPrimary text: 125 characters \nHeadline: 40 characters \n\nImage maximum file size: 30 MB\nVideo maximum file size: 4 GB\n\nFurther reading: 8 Signs of Facebook Ads Issues and How to Fix Them\n\nPromote Organic Posts That Already Perform Well\n\nLook at your organic (i.e., not paid) Facebook posts to understand the types of content that resonate with your target audience.\n\nThis way, you’ll easily create and run a boosted post that advertises content your audience will likely engage with.\n\nFor example, Mario’s shares an organic post announcing they’re opening soon, which creates a lot of engagement.\n\nThey could then boost this organic post to create an ad.\n\nPromoting organic posts also means you don’t need to spend much time creating a Facebook ad. The content is already there and ready to be distributed to your target audience.\n\nTo understand which organic posts create engagement on Facebook, use Semrush Social.\n\nSimply open the tool and click “+ Add profile.”\n\nThen, follow the prompts to connect Facebook.
