They provide a detailed roadmap to follow and implement knowledge. \n\nIn other words: they discuss a topic’s how, what, and why.\n\nWhen Should You Use Guide Blog Posts?\nSupporting Customer Success: If your customers often have questions or challenges about your product or industry. It enhances customer satisfaction and lightens the workload of your support team.\nWhen Introducing a New Concept or Topic: Guide blog posts help beginners grasp subjects more comprehensively.

Making it easier for readers to grasp the fundamentals.\nWhen Targeting Beginners or Individuals Unfamiliar With the Topic: Guide blog posts are designed to assist beginners or those without prior knowledge on a subject. They lay a strong foundation for readers to start their learning journey.\nAnatomy of the Guide Blog Post\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the structure for a guide blog post with instructions on how to write a guide blog post yourself:\n\nCraft a Beginner-Friendly Title\n\nAlign the title to cater to beginners’ interests and goals. Use clear and relatable language, avoiding jargon or complexity. Incorporate SEO keywords naturally, ensuring the title aligns with search intent.\n\nExample: Beginner’s Guide to Meta Tags for SEO\n\nThe title above includes our target keyword, “meta tags.” And tells the readers that the article is a “beginner’s guide.”\n\nHere are some other headline examples:\n\nKickstart Your Journey: A Novice’s Guide to Understanding [Concept]\nDecoding [Concept]: A Beginner’s Ultimate Guide\nEmbark on [Concept]: A Clear, Simple Guide for Beginners\nDemystifying [Concept]: A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners\n[Concept]: A Newcomer’s Roadmap to Success\nBreaking Down [Concept]: A Detailed Guide for the Uninitiated\n[Concept]: What Are They & How to Use Them\nWrite a Simple and Clear Introduction\n\nIntroduce the topic and why it matters. Also tell readers what they can expect to learn.\n\nHere are some tips to make your introduction compelling:\n\nThe “Journey” Teaser: Provide a roadmap of what readers will learn or achieve. Breaking down the key steps or sections you'll cover.\nExplain Why: Explain the practical importance of the topic.\nRelevance: Tease readers with how this topic relates to their goals.\n\nLet’s take a look at the introduction of our guide blog post about meta tags. It has three main sections:\n\nA quick, easy-to-understand definition of meta tags\nA short blurb to establish the importance of meta tags\nA summary to tell the readers what to expect\nCreate a Concise Guide of Key Concepts\n\nThe body of your guide blog post should have four important elements:\n\nClear headers that introduce each section without overwhelming beginners\nAn easy-to-digest explanation of all important concepts related to your main topic\nActionable tips on how beginners can start applying those concept\nOther important tips or concepts you think a beginner should know\n\nLet’s see that in action by looking again at our article on meta tags:\n\nThe article starts with a section that goes deeper into what meta tags actually are. Which is why that first section has the header, “What Are Meta Tags.”\n\nFrom there, the article defines the three types of meta tags: meta description, robots meta tags, and viewport meta tags. Each definition is followed by an actionable section on how to optimize each tag for SEO.\n\nHere’s what that looks like for the section on meta descriptions:\n\nLastly, since title tags are related to meta tags, the article explains what those are, as well. And also has a section on how to optimize title tags for SEO.\n\nGenerally, the body of a guide post should contain the “what,” “why,” and “how,” behind each concept.\n\nThat way, even after beginners read the post, they continue to refer to it when they’re stuck, forget what they need to do, or need a little more guidance.\n\nProvide Next Steps\n\nOffer valuable insights to reinforce the guide's value. And tell readers what to do next, whether that’s through:\n\nPresenting key takeaways\nLinking out to additional resources or more in-depth guides\nUsing a call to action (CTA) that says, “Click here to…”\n\nFor example, our conclusion for the meta tags guide post includes a header to tease the next steps.

Offer it for free in exchange for readers’ emails. You can also use this as a lead-generation strategy.\nTroubleshooting: Address common pitfalls, challenges, or roadblocks that readers might encounter. Include a troubleshooting section with proactive solutions to enhance the guide’s practicality. And help readers overcome obstacles effectively.\nPillar Blog Post Template\n\nPillar blog posts are often called pillar pages or cornerstone content. They’re enormous pieces covering a core topic in great detail. \n\nBut: pillar blog posts are foundations for clusters of related content.
