  "content": "YouTube can help you reach a global audience. But producing great content may not be enough to catch your target audience’s attention. Or increase views, traffic, and conversions.\n\nYou’ll need a strategic marketing plan for that. And the right tools. \n\nIn this guide, we'll show you how to promote your YouTube channel for maximum reach. Let's dive in.\n\nThe Benefits of YouTube Channel Promotion\n\nYouTube is the second-most popular social media platform after Facebook, according to Statista. The video platform outranks Instagram, WhatsApp, and TikTok. \n\nPromoting your YouTube channel could help you reach hundreds of thousands of new viewers. It's also a cost-effective way to drive brand awareness and engagement. While nurturing your target audience. \n\nFor example, this YouTube video from pet company Chewy received 1.5 million views. Which exposed the brand to a wider audience. And potentially helped them attract new and existing customers to its site. \n\nThe more popular your channel becomes, the more opportunities you have to generate revenue.\n\nFor example, YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson’s primary channel, MrBeast, has over 200 million subscribers. \n\nHis videos regularly get well over 1 million views each. And thousands of comments. Helping him earn a substantial income from YouTube’s monetization program for creators (YouTube Partner Program). \n\nWhile you can't reach this level of notoriety overnight, there are steps you can take to get more eyes on your channel. \n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush's Social Tracker to monitor your competitors’ social media accounts. The app provides insight into their performance across platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and X (formerly Twitter). See how you stack up against them and gain a better understanding of your audience. \n\nHow to Market a YouTube Channel: 25 Tips for Brands and Creators \n\nYouTube channel promotion involves a little bit of everything. Including video SEO, copywriting, and social media marketing. \n\n1. Optimize Video Titles with Trending Keywords\n\nInclude relevant keywords, or search terms, in video titles, captions, and other strategic locations. To increase your channel’s chances of coming up in search results. \n\nUse a tool like our Keyword Analytics for YouTube to find trending terms related to your videos. \n\nLog into the tool and view your dashboard to see the top keywords on YouTube in the U.S. \n\nSelect a different country from the drop-down menu under \"Location\" in the top right, if needed. \n\nView the most popular keywords for your preferred time frame. Such as \"Last Day,\" \"Last Week,\" or \"Last Month.\"\n\nCheck the section \"Fast growing keywords\" to see trending YouTube search terms.\n\nType a keyword into the search bar to see how it performed over the past day, week, or month. \n\nClick “Search.” Then, analyze the data for that time range.\n\nThe tool displays each keyword's average search volume and competitive rate. Which indicates the average competition level in YouTube’s search results.\n\nFor example, “driving tips” had 96 searches and a “medium” competitive rate (31) over the past week. \n\nThis keyword isn't popular on YouTube at the moment. Which means you may not get many views for a video targeting “driving tips.”\n\nThe tool will also suggest related keywords—and some may have a higher search volume.\n\nWhen you find a strong keyword that matches your content, use it naturally in the video title.\n\nFor instance, this video by fitness brand Athlean-X is called “8 Best Bodyweight Exercises Ever (Hit Every Muscle).” \n\nAs you might have guessed, \"best bodyweight exercises\" is the target keyword.\n\nIdentify Popular YouTube Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Analytics for YouTube App\n\nSubscribe Now →\n2. Create Eye-Catching Thumbnails\n\nA thumbnail acts as a preview for your video. So, viewers know what to expect. They also aid in navigation, helping users find content.\n\nBut they can also help you get more views. \n\nIn fact, users are more likely to be influenced by titles and thumbnails than other factors when deciding whether to watch a YouTube video, according to a study.\n\nEnsure your video thumbnails are eye-catching and high quality. And representative of your video’s content to attract more viewers. \n\nFor example, in the thumbnails below, the creator used local landmarks, like the Alps, to entice people to click.\n\nUse a similar layout or color scheme for your thumbnails to create a cohesive brand identity. Then, use the same (or complementary) colors and fonts for text overlays. \n\nPro tip\n\nPerform A/B testing to compare two versions of a thumbnail for the same video. Select the one with the highest click-through rate (CTR).\n\n3. Include Keywords in Video Titles and Descriptions\n\nOptimize each video for one primary keyword, or main search term. Place it as close to the beginning of the description as possible. \n\nAnd use secondary keywords where appropriate. These are synonyms or variations of your primary keyword.\n\nKeywords help YouTube understand what your video is about. And make your content easier to find online.\n\nFor instance, this video by Semrush is optimized for \"on-page SEO.\" The keyword appears in the title, description, and hashtags.\n\nPro tip\n\nIdentify popular search terms with Semrush's Keyword Magic Tool. Learn monthly search volume, keyword difficulty, and more.\n\n4. Leverage Hashtags in Descriptions\n\nUse three to five hashtags in your descriptions to improve video SEO. And include your target keywords.\n\nHashtags help YouTube understand the content of your video. They also help users find your channel.\n\nLet's say you upload a video featuring exercises for lower back pain. And add relevant hashtags. Like #backpainrelief or #lowerbackpain.\n\nWhen someone uses one of these hashtags when searching in YouTube, your video may appear in the platform’s search results.\n\nHashtags can also help your videos show up as related content. \n\nSay someone is watching a video with the hashtag #backpainrelief—and clicks on the hashtag. YouTube will show them other videos using the same hashtag. \n\nUsing official hashtags associated with your brand is also helpful. For instance, author Abbie Emmons uses #AskAbbie to help viewers find all of her Q&A videos.\n\nNote\n\nThe more hashtags you add to a video, the less relevant it becomes. Over-tagging is considered spam and may result in your content being removed from search‌ results.\n\n5. Create Engaging Video Intros\n\nYour intro needs to grab viewers’ attention instantly. And leave them wanting more so they don’t move on to someone else’s video. \n\nTell an engaging story, establish common ground with your audience, or make a controversial statement.\n\nYou might also get straight to the point by telling them what you'll cover in the video. This tactic works best for technical videos, tutorials, and product demos.\n\nFor example, the online tech publication Android Authority made a comparison video between the Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. \n\nThe narrator introduces the topic and points out the price difference between the two smartphones immediately to hook viewers. \n\nDepending on the topic, you might use animations, background music, or visual effects to make your intros more engaging. These elements should resonate with your target audience. And reflect your brand's identity.\n\nPro tip\n\nAdd captions to your videos to make them accessible to a wider audience, including viewers with disabilities. YouTube can automatically generate captions, but they may not be 100% accurate. \n\n6. Use End Screens to Promote Other Videos\n\nEnd screens are video outros that help people discover your content. Which can result in more views and traffic. \n\nIf your video is at least 25 seconds long, add end screens during the last five to 20 seconds. \n\nUse end screens to:\n\nPromote your other videos\nAsk viewers to subscribe\nLink to your website\nLink to another YouTube channel\n\nFor example, this Semrush YouTube video has two end screens. One showing the next video. And one featuring a recommended video. \n\nIt also has a prominent call to action (CTA) button telling viewers to subscribe.\n\nEnd screens may prevent users from leaving your YouTube channel. Depending on their content, they can persuade viewers to take specific actions. Such as hitting \"Subscribe.\"\n\nFor best results, feature your top-performing videos on your end screens. Alternatively, choose videos on a related topic. And label them with actionable terms. Like \"Watch next.\"\n\nYou might also want to add a subscribe button with relevant text (e.g., \"Subscribe to my channel\"). YouTube displays a subscribe button on end screens by default, but it lacks text.\n\nNote\n\nEnd screens can link to your site or other external resources only if you're in the YouTube Partner Program. This means you have to meet certain criteria. Such as having at least 1,000 subscribers with 4,000 hours of watch time in the last year.\n\n7. Schedule Regular Uploads\n\nStick to a regular publishing schedule to keep your audience engaged. The ideal frequency for your channel depends on your audience and goals. \n\nWhat matters most is consistency.\n\nLet's say you want to know how to market a new YouTube channel. Ideally, upload content daily to achieve faster growth. If that’s not an option, aim for at least once a week.\n\nThere are no hard rules on how often to post on YouTube.\n\nConsider making multiple videos at a time. And uploading them at regular intervals. This can help you build a loyal audience and keep viewers coming back for more.\n\nPro tip\n\nTurn your blog posts into videos with Semrush's AI Video Marketing Automator. The app uses AI to generate videos for social platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest. It can also add captions, voice-overs, and animations.\n\n8. Promote Your Videos on Social Media\n\nShare your videos on other social media sites to increase views and engagement. Use tools like Buffer or Hootsuite to distribute your content across multiple platforms.\n\nFacebook: Post the video on your personal and business pages, share in relevant groups, and use Facebook Stories with direct links.\nX: Craft engaging tweets with hashtags and a direct link, pin the tweet to your profile, and engage with trending topics and communities related to your video.\nInstagram: Share a teaser clip or thumbnail in your feed with a link in bio, use Instagram Stories with a video link, and create an IGTV video with a preview directing people to your YouTube channel.\nLinkedIn: Share the video on your personal and company pages, post in relevant industry groups and forums, and write a brief article or post discussing the video’s content with a link.\nPinterest: Create a pin with an eye-catching thumbnail and link to the video, add the pin to relevant boards, and use keywords and hashtags in the pin description.\nTikTok: Create short, engaging clips or previews related to your video, use popular hashtags and sounds to increase visibility, and direct viewers to your YouTube channel for the full video.\n\nNot sure where your audience is most active outside of YouTube? Use a tool like Social Tracker to analyze your closest competitors’ social media activity. \n\nSo, you know where to focus your efforts to maximize results. \n\nEnter your website URL and competitor's company name or domain in the designated field. \n\nClick \"Add company.\"\n\nAdd up to 20 competitors. Then, click \"Start tracking companies.\"\n\nSemrush will display your social media activity, subscriber count, top content, and other relevant data. \n\nScroll to “Comparison With Competitors” to see how you stack up.\n\nFor more information, scroll back up and click the social media tabs next to \"Overview.\" Select a competitor to gain insight into their activity on that respective platform.\n\nSay you want to see how your competitor's videos perform on Instagram. Click \"Instagram\" > “Posts.” Select “Reel” from the drop-down menu under “Post type.”\n\nThe Social Tracker will display your competitor’s Instagram reels. Along with relevant data. Like their engagement rate, likes, and comments over the past 30 days. \n\nYou can also click the tab labeled “Last 30 days” to choose a different period. \n\nNow, click the “Audience” tab to see how many followers they got on Instagram over that period. And check their activity and engagement rates. \n\nSimilarly, you can check your performance and that of other competitors on Instagram. And all the major social networks. \n\nThis data can help you decide where to promote your videos. And uncover gaps in your competitors' video marketing strategy. Including the topics and video types your audience is interested in that you haven’t covered yet.\n\nLink to your social media accounts in video descriptions to increase your follower count on other platforms. And make it easier for users to share your videos.\n\nHere's an example from Semrush:\n\nSocial media bios, like Instagram and Facebook, offer another opportunity to cross-promote your YouTube Channel. \n\nFor instance, content creators Kyde and Eric use this tactic to promote their latest YouTube videos on Instagram.\n\nFurther reading: How to Perform a Social Media Competitor Analysis in 6 Steps\n\n9. Engage in YouTube Community Posts\n\nYouTube Community posts are social media posts similar to those shared on Facebook or other platforms. \n\nHere’s an example from creator Fit with Ashlee featuring her dog. \n\nCreate Community posts to inform, educate, or entertain your audience. For instance, share quizzes and polls, make announcements, or host challenges.\n\nThe posts appear under the “Community” tab. This section is located next to \"Playlists\" on your YouTube channel homepage. \n\nUse this section to tease your audience with behind-the-scenes shots, ask for feedback, or promote older content.\n\nFor example, say you want to make a video about meal prep. Ask your followers to share their biggest challenges with meal planning.\n\nNot only can this strategy drive engagement, but it may also inspire future videos.\n\n10. Collaborate with Other YouTube Creators\n\nJoin forces with other YouTubers to expand your reach and get more exposure. Focus on those targeting audiences similar to yours.\n\nLet's say your YouTube channel revolves around yoga. Team up with a physical therapist to provide more value to your audience.\n\nFor example, work together to make a video about the best yoga poses for back pain. Or interview each other on topics like:\n\nThe benefits of yoga for back pain\nHow yoga increases flexibility\nWhat poses to avoid during pregnancy\n\nFor example, YouTube creator Mark Rober partnered with MrBeast for a social video project. The two went on a mission to plant 20 million trees using drones. \n\nThey created a video to document their efforts. And it received over 26 million views and 947,000 likes.\n\nA partnership can lead to more video views and subscribers, higher-quality content, and greater engagement—for both parties. \n\nTo find YouTubers to collaborate with, join vidIQ's Talking YouTube room on Clubhouse, r/PartneredYoutube, or relevant Facebook groups. \n\nAnother option is ChannelCrawler, an online database featuring over 150 million YouTube channels. Sort the channels by category, language, subscriber count, and other criteria.\n\n11. Host Livestreams with Interactive Sessions\n\nUse YouTube Live to engage with viewers. And build a community around your brand. \n\nTalk directly to your fans and address their comments as they roll in. This keeps viewers invested. And provides valuable feedback and insights in real time.\n\nWhich can enhance your followers’ overall experience. And encourage longer watch times.\n\nLivestreaming ideas include: \n\nQ&A sessions\nClasses\nVirtual challenges\nEvent broadcasts\nPolls\nStorytelling \n\nPro tip\n\nEnable the Super Chat feature during livestreams to make extra money. Viewers pay a fee to get their messages highlighted or pinned.\n\nInteractive live streaming also gives you insight into your audience. Ask how they feel about your products, what type of content they want to see more of, or what challenges they face.\n\nFor example, this five-hour YouTube livestream event covered content marketing topics. Semrush created the video in collaboration with Julia McCoy, Kevin Phillips, Casie Gillette, and other industry experts.\n\nThroughout the event, the speakers encouraged viewers to ask questions, leave comments, and share their thoughts.\n\n12. Include Calls to Action in Videos\n\nIncorporate clear CTAs into video and channel descriptions and within your videos. These may include banners, buttons, or icons that urge viewers to:\n\nSubscribe\nLike\nShare\nComment\nWatch more\nVisit your website\nFollow your brand on social media\n\nPlace your CTAs strategically throughout your video. Mid-roll CTAs, which run in the middle of a video, have a 15% to 23% conversion rate, according to a Wistia study. \n\nBy comparison, only 6% of pre-roll CTAs (which run before a video begins) and 13% of post-roll CTAs (which play after the video) result in conversions.\n\nUse CTAs that feature an image. Wistia also found that image CTAs, such as buttons and icons, convert better than text CTAs. \n\nHere’s an example of this type of CTA as a simple subscribe button:\n\nPro tip\n\nThe most effective CTAs use power words like \"you,\" \"now,\" \"new,\" and \"free.” Add these to your video CTAs to increase conversion rates. \n\n13. Incentivize Your Audience\n\nHost giveaways, challenges, or contests to get viewers to engage with and share your videos.\n\nUse these ideas for inspiration:\n\nCreate subscriber-only videos\nRecognize your top fans by giving them shoutouts\nInclude user-generated content (UGC) in your videos\nHost contests where viewers must subscribe, like, and comment to enter\nFeature your fans in guest appearances or interviews\n\nFor instance, makeup artist Eric Thompson shared a video tutorial on YouTube.\n\nShe gave viewers the chance to win a makeup palette like the one in her video. To enter the contest, fans had to leave a comment saying they wanted to win.\n\nWith this approach, Thompson taught her fans something new and incentivized them to take action.\n\nPro tip\n\nConsider your marketing goals when hosting a giveaway. For example, offer product samples or promotional merch to build brand awareness.\n\n14. Leverage YouTube Ads for Targeted Promotion\n\nUse YouTube Ads to get your video content in front of the right audience. \n\nA well-planned ad campaign can have the following benefits: \n\nExpand your reach\nDrive conversions\nGrow your subscribers\nIncrease website traffic\nBoost brand awareness\n\nFirst, experiment with different ad formats, such as skippable vs. non-skippable in-stream ads, to see what works best for your brand.\n\nFor example, skippable in-stream ads last anywhere between 12 seconds to six minutes. But viewers can stop them after five seconds. \n\nIf you choose this ad format, use a \"hook\" right at the beginning. The goal is to grab viewers' attention immediately so they don't skip the ad.\n\nFor example: \n\n\"Hey! You want to know why the pros make CrossFit look so easy? It's not because they're in better shape than you. Or because they have more time for training than you do. \"\n\nNext comes a thought-provoking answer. Like, “It’s because of their mindset.” Which piques viewers’ interest and gets them to click your ad to learn more. \n\nOnce you have a hook, build an emotional rapport with your viewers to improve your ad’s conversion rate. Share personal stories, experiences, or insights that relate to your circumstances and the topic.\n\nThis two-minute video ad by NOS Telecom, for instance, tells the story of a boy who shares Santa's phone number with others. It's engaging and visually appealing. And touches an emotional chord with the brand’s audience.\n\nSimilarly, you can evoke emotions and inspire action with your ads by following these tips: \n\nUse storytelling techniques to build a narrative that resonates with your audience.\nChoose words that evoke strong emotions. Such as joy, nostalgia, urgency, or empathy.\nIncorporate a clear call to action that aligns with the emotional journey of your ad.\nMatch the music to the mood you want to create. For example, uplifting music for a feel-good ad. Or suspenseful music to build tension.\nEnsure the music complements the pacing of your ad. And enhances key moments.\nUse high-quality images and footage that align with your brand and message. And show real people and authentic scenarios to make your ad relatable.\n\nFurther reading: The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide to YouTube Ad Targeting\n\n15. Track Video Performance to Refine Your Strategy\n\nCheck your YouTube Analytics data to monitor video performance. And gain a better understanding of your audience. Use these insights to optimize your content creation efforts.\n\nYouTube Analytics is a free tool for tracking watch time, engagement rates, views, and other metrics. It also shows when your viewers are active on the platform, what other channels they watch, and more.\n\nThis data is available under \"Analytics\" on the YouTube Studio dashboard.\n\nThe metrics displayed in the \"Audience\" section provide insights into your viewers' demographics and preferences. Based on this information, you can create more relevant videos.\n\nIdeally, use this analytics tool along with Semrush's Rank Tracker for YouTube. Rank Tracker shows you how your content ranks in YouTube search results for the target keywords.\n\nOnce the setup is complete, view your average YouTube rank for all the keywords on your list. And other data, such as your overall keyword distribution and search ranking changes.\n\nThe tool also displays your top-performing keywords, their average monthly search volume, and how you rank for them.\n\nPick a keyword, and click the \"Preview\" button.\n\nSemrush will open a pop-up window featuring the top 20 YouTube videos ranking for your keyword.\n\nLeverage this data to monitor your competitors, see what they do well, and find gaps in their strategy.\n\nAnalyze Your Channel’s Growth\n\nwith the Rank Tracker for YouTube App\n\nSubscribe Today →\n16. Create Video Playlists to Organize Your Content\n\nGroup related videos into playlists to keep them organized and boost their visibility.\n\nFor instance, the TED Talks channel features dozens of playlists. Some include video series. Others consist of videos on similar themes. Such as \"Talks to help you negotiate\" or \"Art and design.\"\n\nPlaylists often appear in YouTube's search results, which can result in more views. And improve your YouTube SEO.\n\nThey also help viewers discover more of your content. If they like what they see, they may stick around longer. This can increase watch time through binge-watching and help make your videos rank higher.\n\n17. Encourage User-Generated Content\n\nAsk your customers and social media fans to share their experiences with your brand. For example, they could record themselves using your products or leave video reviews.\n\nThese types of videos fall under UGC. The same goes for podcast conversations, video testimonials, or branded selfies from customers.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse UGC to keep your channel fresh and reduce content production costs. For example, share video testimonials from customers once a week to avoid creating content from scratch.\n\nIn the video below, content creator Roxanne Latulippe describes her experience with the MAC Cosmetics Lip Pencil. \n\nShe doesn't say anything about sponsorships or affiliations, so we can assume her review falls under UGC.\n\nAs a business owner, you can feature this content on your YouTube channel to build trust. UGC serves as social proof and can increase brand recognition.\n\n18. Respond to Comments Promptly\n\nAddress viewers' comments quickly to drive engagement. And create a better user experience. Aim to do this while your video is still fresh in their minds, not days or weeks later.\n\nReplying in a timely manner demonstrates you care about your fans and want to hear what they have to say. This can help you build meaningful connections.\n\nPersonalize your replies to show empathy. Acknowledge and appreciate criticism, ignore the trolls, and thank your followers for sharing their thoughts.\n\n19. Optimize Your Channel’s SEO\n\nFollow SEO best practices on your YouTube channel. Including optimizing it for target keywords, providing valuable content, and adding closed captions.\n\nStart by creating relevant titles that match the content of your video. And include your main keyword in the title.\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Analytics for YouTube to find high-performing search terms. If, say, you want to make a video about parallel parking, enter this topic in the tool to get keyword ideas. \n\nWhen someone types \"parallel parking\" in YouTube's search bar, they expect to find videos on parallel parking.\n\nBut since there are hundreds of videos on this topic, you'll want to craft an engaging title that drives viewers to watch your content. A good example is the video below:\n\nIts title, \"Learn how to parallel park. The easiest driving lesson,\" is relevant and descriptive. It tells viewers what to expect if they watch the video—and why they should do it.\n\nHere's what else you can do to optimize your YouTube channel:\n\nInclude your target keyword in the video file name, video title, description, and transcript\nUse keyword-rich tags related to the topic covered in your video\nAdd subtitles and closed captions to make your videos accessible to a wider audience\nPlace the most important information within the first 100-120 characters of the description to ensure it appears on search results pages\nUse chapters and at least three timestamps to help viewers navigate your video more easily\nLink from your website and social media pages to your YouTube channel\n\nThese practices can help your videos rank better in YouTube's search results. Which can lead to more views, higher engagement, and increased revenue.\n\nExperiment with different video lengths.\n\nFor example, longer videos can increase watch time—assuming they contain quality, relevant content. As mentioned earlier, a longer watch time may contribute to higher rankings.\n\nFurther reading: YouTube Backlinks: Why They Matter and How to Build Them for SEO\n\n20. Develop a Signature Content Style\n\nCreate your own style, even if that means being controversial or unconventional. Distinguish yourself through your narrative voice, music choices, or filming technique to make a lasting impression on viewers.\n\nDepending on your niche, you may be covering the same topics as thousands of other YouTubers. The only way to stand out from the crowd is to do things better. Or differently.\n\nSo, if you want to know how to do YouTube channel marketing like a pro, check out Mr. Beast and other top creators. Follow the example of HowToBasic, Tasting History with Max Miller, or Dr. Pimple Popper.\n\nFor instance, Tasting History with Max Miller features historical recipes from past eras. The host has a distinctive narrative style and brings a fresh perspective to cooking. Which keeps viewers glued to the screen.\n\nMiller uses humor and storytelling to draw viewers in. He also shares personal experiences to build rapport with his audience. If you watch his videos, you’ll see that he creates a narrative around each recipe or cooking technique. \n\nAnother example comes from Grant Thompson. He runs The King of Random, a YouTube channel featuring odd and unique DIY projects and experiments. \n\nViewers can learn how to make LEGO gummies, turn pencil lead into diamonds, produce fuel from water, and more. \n\n21. Use Influencer Marketing to Boost Your Reach\n\nTeam up with influencers to grow your online presence and reach more viewers. Ideally, choose influencers in your niche to ensure they target a similar audience as you.\n\nFor example, Natalie Barbu, a YouTube influencer with 300k+ subscribers, runs a vlog. In one video, she told her audience how she uses Asana, Skillshare, and Google Calendar for work.\n\nBarbu discusses these products without coming off as overly promotional. The video was sponsored by Skillshare, but it doesn't sound like an advertisement. And that's what makes it so effective.\n\nDepending on what you sell, collaborate with influencers on:\n\nUnboxing videos\nHow-to videos\nProduct review videos\nTeaser videos\nShopping hauls\nTutorials\nGiveaways\n\nAsk them to link to or mention your YouTube channel in their videos. This could be something like, \"Be sure to check out [your channel] for more information.\"\n\nInfluencers have loyal fans who trust their recommendations. Their endorsement can help you build credibility, gain exposure, and reach untapped customer groups.\n\nFurther reading: YouTube Influencer Marketing: A Four-Step Guide \n\n22. Feature Guest Appearances\n\nInvite guests to be on your livestreams and other videos to tap into their audiences and provide more value to your fans. Reach out to industry experts, celebrities, and other notable figures.\n\nLet's say you run a YouTube channel for first-time homebuyers.\n\nConsider hosting a Q&A session with a successful real estate agent. Or invite multiple guests. Such as realtors, personal finance advisors, and construction engineers.\n\nRemember Semrush's video on content marketing that we discussed earlier? It featured some of the brightest minds in the industry. And the audience walked away with actionable advice.\n\nThis type of content will add variety to your channel, which can boost engagement. Plus, it can help you build trust with potential customers.\n\n23. Create a Compelling Channel Trailer\n\nMake a channel trailer on YouTube to show new viewers what to expect. And why they should subscribe.\n\nYouTube channel trailers serve a similar purpose to movie trailers: to spark excitement and curiosity about the material being covered. They give viewers a sneak peek into your content, making them want to see more.\n\nFor example, Babish Culinary Universe features a two-minute trailer offering a preview of the channel. \n\nIt highlights the main theme (learn to recreate your favorite recipes from movies) through compelling visuals and upbeat background music.\n\nGenerally, it's best to keep your trailer short. After all, you don't want to give everything away.\n\nBriefly describe your content and what sets it apart, telling viewers what's in it for them. Get to the point quickly and reinforce your CTA with text, visuals, and sound effects.\n\nFurther reading: How to Get Subscribers on YouTube: 6 Tips for Free Growth \n\n24. Engage in Cross-Promotion with Bloggers\n\nTeam up with bloggers to reach new audiences and grow your channel. With this approach, you'll promote each other's content and collaborate on projects.\n\nLet's say your YouTube channel revolves around life hacks. Reach out to bloggers who cover topics like productivity, time management, or work-life balance.\n\nCreate a series of videos on “Life Hacks for Busy Professionals\" or something similar.\n\nEncourage viewers to visit the partner blog for more insights into the topic. The blogger could write complementary content—and embed your videos into their posts.\n\n25. Experiment with Various Video Formats\n\nDon't limit yourself to one type of video, such as tutorials or vlogs. Instead, try out various video formats to diversify your content. And appeal to different customer groups.\n\nLet's see a few examples:\n\nAsk Me Anything (AMA) videos\nChallenge videos\nExplainer videos\nInterviews\nDocuseries\nBest of videos\nOpinion-based videos\nBehind-the-scenes videos\nEmployee spotlight videos\n\nFor instance, SaaS company Freshworks uses multiple video formats as part of its marketing strategy. Some revolve around its products and services. While others focus on the company's culture or corporate events.\n\nIn 2021, the brand launched \"Freshworks Amazing Customer Stories,\" a video series showing how organizations adapted their customer service to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nThe videos were fresh, original, and inspiring, blending UGC with branded content.\n\nA diverse content strategy helps keep your audience guessing and prevent monotony. It also allows you to address the same topic from different angles, which can lead to higher engagement.\n\nGrow Your YouTube Channel with Semrush\n\nThere are many ways to promote your YouTube channel. But it all starts with a comprehensive strategy. And tools that make it faster and easier to optimize your videos and monitor growth. \n\nUse our Social Tracker tool to research your competitors’ social media activity.
