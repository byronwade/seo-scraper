So you can align with shifting consumer and competitor behaviors, emerging platforms, and changing preferences.\n\nWith that in mind, we’ve created a compendium of the most important advertising statistics. Keep it handy to guide your digital ad spending in 2024 and beyond.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\nMobile Advertising Statistics\n\nMost internet users have smartphones.

These stats confirm that consumers’ love for smaller screens continues to grow.\n\nSpending increases tell us advertisers see this trend too. They’re responding by allocating even more of their budgets to mobile search, social, and video marketing. To keep pace with the competition, you’ll need to do the same, and use the right ad formats.\n\nFurther reading: Explore the mobile ad formats and tactics available to you, and learn how to choose the right ones in our guide How to Leverage Mobile Advertising.\n\nSocial Media Advertising Statistics\n\nThe social media marketing landscape changes frequently. It aligns with consumers’ evolving preferences around content consumption.\n\nStay on top with help from these social media advertising statistics:\n\nMore people discover new brands, products, and services via social media ads than by word-of-mouth recommendations, brand and product websites, and consumer review sites (DataReportal, 2023)\nSocial media ads are the top source of new brand discovery for internet users aged 16-24 (DataReportal, 2023)\nThe top three social media channels based on potential ad reach in the United States are:\nFacebook: 188,050,000\nInstagram: 161,700,000\nTikTok: 150,000,000+\n\n(DataReportal, July 2023) (TikTok, March 2023)\n\nThe average click-through rate (CTR) for a social media ad is 1.36% (Statista, Q2 2023)\nSocial media ad spending is projected to reach $207.1 billion in 2023 (Statista, 2023)\nThe average U.S. social media buyer is projected to spend $779 via social networks in 2024, and $937 in 2025 (Insider Intelligence, 2022)\nThere are 4.88 billion social media user identities—equating to 60.6% of the population (DataReportal, 2023)\nSocial media users are currently growing at a rate of 9.6 new users every second.

That remains crucial.\n\nBut now, consumers can buy products directly on social platforms. The advent of social commerce introduces a new dimension to marketing strategies. \n\nWith consumers now able to buy through direct links (like in the TikTok example above), it’s vital to vary your online ads. Use some to drive traffic to your online store, and others with more direct language to encourage quick sales.\n\nFurther reading: We run through the best social networks for advertising and offer tips on building persuasive ad campaigns in our Beginner’s Guide to Social Media Advertising.\n\nFacebook Advertising Statistics\n\nAs the most-used social media platform in the world, Facebook can be an ideal place to target almost any demographic with online ads and other marketing campaigns.\n\nHere are some telling stats on Facebook’s current position in the advertising market.\n\nFacebook has the largest reach of all social media advertising platforms in the U.S., with 188,050,000 users (DataReportal, 2023)\nOnly 25% of users access Facebook via laptop or desktop (Khoros, 2022)\n40% of Facebook advertisers use the Click-to-Messaging format (Meta, 2022)\n\nDespite many of its competitors achieving mass popularity in recent years, Facebook remains hugely relevant to internet users. That means it’s almost certainly relevant to you as an online advertiser, too.\n\nIn particular, pay close attention to Facebook’s “Click-to-Message” feature, which looks like this:\n\nImage Source: ShopPop\n\nGiving users a direct and personal channel to your business can help you build stronger relationships and influence purchasing decisions.
