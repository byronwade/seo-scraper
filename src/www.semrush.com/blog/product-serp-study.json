  "content": "To better understand how products appear in Search Engine Results Page (SERP) features, Semrush collected 7,000 SERPs for product-oriented searches to uncover what features are more prominent.\n\nSERP Features on Mobile and Desktop\n\nSemrush examined five product-related features and how they appeared on desktop and mobile—Popular Products, Product Filter, Refine, Buying Guide, and Related Products.\n\nAmong the highlighted SERPs:\n\nMost features display on both mobile and desktop at similar frequencies \nPopular Products show at the highest frequency in 79% of product searches for mobile\nProduct Filter has the biggest percentage difference between mobile (36%) and desktop (61%)\n\nThe above bar chart can help you make informed decisions on how to target the features most relevant to your ideal customers. \n\nEcommerce SERP Feature Breakdown\nPopular Products\n\nPopular Products displays relevant items from various ecommerce stores.\n\nOn desktop, the maximum number of items in the product list was at 32 while mobile listed a max of 10. This means more products can show up on desktop compared to mobile search. \n\nOn average, mobile showed a lower number of unique stores (three) compared to desktop search, which delivered five.\n\nProduct Filter\n\nThe Product Filter feature appears at the top of the SERP on desktop only. It suggests clarifying keywords for the search query. \n\nRefine\n\nThe Refine feature contains a list of related search queries to help narrow the product search by categories.\n\nThe average number of categories on desktop and mobile are the same.\n\nOn mobile, the Refine feature is less product-oriented than on desktop, and looks similar to the Related keywords feature for non-shopping related searches.\n\nBuying Guide\n\nThe Buying Guide is a list of questions about a product’s features related to the search query. You can expand each block to learn more about a specific feature of the product.\n\nBy default, only four items are shown; click “More considerations” to reveal other questions. On average, seven blocks come up on both mobile and desktop devices.\n\nThe average number of questions and the median number of questions are the same across the board (7) for both desktop and mobile.\n\nRelated Products\n\nSimilar to Popular Products, the Related Products feature shows a variety of relevant items across many different stores. Unlike Popular Products, it provides more information about each item and is formatted in a way to encourage comparison.\n\nDesktop view:\n\nMobile view:\n\nThe share of related products with reviews is almost identical on both desktop (99.32%) and mobile (99.02%). Related descriptions show up far less frequently on mobile at 11.49%.\n\nAs for the average number of products, desktop lists five items while mobile shows four.\n\nMost of these blocks contain products with reviews, underlining the importance of earning customer reviews for each product. \n\nImprove Your Product Listings with Semrush Data\n\nWith this data, collected by Semrush, you can target Google’s product SERP features to increase your visibility and reach.\n\nTo capture product-related Google SERP features, try the Ecommerce Booster app in the Semrush App Center.
