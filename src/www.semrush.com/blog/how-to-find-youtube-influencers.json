  "content": "YouTube influencers can be a key part of a successful marketing strategy. \n\nNot only can they help promote your brand, but they can increase your audience reach on one of the biggest content platforms out there.\n\nMost importantly, the right influencers are relatable, trustworthy and get your target audience’s attention. \n\nSounds good. But what about all the hard work it takes to find the right influencer for your brand? \n\nLet’s look at some fast, easy and efficient ways to find your next YouTube influencer.\n\nWhy use YouTube influencers?\n\nThere are more than two billion active users on YouTube – that’s a huge pool of people to potentially build brand relationships with. And, because of its scope and popularity, YouTube is the second most preferred platform for influencer marketing.\n\nBut it’s not just the size of YouTube that makes it such a powerful tool for influencer marketing. Google research shows that influencers on the platform have the same power to guide people’s purchase decisions as celebrities.\n\nSo, rather than trying to leverage famous names, brands can tap into the same persuasion through the array of influencers.\n\nVideo content always resonates well with audiences. It’s accessible, interactive, and humanizing.\n\nIn modern marketing, audiences want brands that represent real people, and so by working with YouTube influencers, you demonstrate that you have value, vouched for by influencers they recognize.\n\nYouTube influencer videos can take many formats but a few popular examples are:\n\nUnboxing (an influencer opens and uses a product/service for the first time)\nProduct reviews (an influencer provides an honest opinion of a product/service)\nContests (influencers provide brand products/services as prizes in their content)\nHauls (an influencer rates products/services from different brands)\nTutorials (products/services appear in steps for influencers’ explainer content)\nDay-in-the-life-of (products/services feature in influencer videos of their daily routines)\nWhat makes a good YouTube influencer?\n\nWith 250 million subscribers, MrBeast might be the most popular influencer in the world, but does his core audience align with your brand objectives? And will your budget stretch far enough to work with him?\n\nDon’t dive in and start contacting people right away. Like any element of your marketing strategy, finding the right YouTube influencer requires research. \n\nFirst, you need to ensure that your influencer has the audience size and reach that you’re looking for. They also need to have a voice that aligns with your brand and messaging, as well as a price that matches your budget.\n\nOnce you’ve checked those basic characteristics, delve deeper into their previous content and online presence.\n\nPay attention to the number of views they get per post, the average number of likes, and links to any other social profiles they may have. You can do this manually or by leveraging influencer marketing tools like Influencer Analytics. \n\nIt’s also worthwhile asking yourself a few questions before you reach out to influencers. \n\nIs there a clear connection between the influencer’s content and my product/service?\nWhat problems/pain points does the influencer’s audience have that my product/service could solve?\nWhat values does my brand share with the influencer?\nWhat would motivate the influencer to collaborate with my brand?\nWould my target audience listen and trust this influencer? Why?\n\nFind YouTube Influencers\n\nwith Influencer Analytics\n\nTry for Free →\nHow do I find a YouTube influencer?\n\nYou can find YouTube influencers either manually or using specific tools.\n\nStart by searching keywords that relate to your brand or product in YouTube and browsing influencer videos that appear. You can also dedicate time to research influencers through social media, search engines, blog posts, and recommendations.\n\nOnce you have a group of influencers that you’re interested in, review their past collaborations and content and determine if they’re a good fit for you.\n\nThis approach can bring good influencer partnerships, but it is time consuming and your scope may be limited. Not to mention, you won’t be able to access important engagement metrics like the average number of views and likes per post.\n\nA savvy alternative is to use influencer-finding tools like Influencer Analytics from Semrush.\n\nHow can I find YouTube influencers with Influencer Analytics?\n\nInfluencer Analytics is an influencer marketing discovery and competitive intelligence app. One of its main offerings is helping brands find YouTube influencers.\n\nIn the ‘Influencers Discovery’ tab, you can select the platform where you’re targeting influencers (in this case, YouTube). \n\nYou can then enter keywords and apply various filters to your search, including the influencer’s country, language, audience size, contact info, and more. You can save your filter choices too, so they are automatically applied to future searches throughout the app.\n\nFor example, if your product is in the auto industry and you wanted to find influencers in the United Kingdom and the United States with a budget of $15k or less that have an email address available to reach out to, you’d apply those three filters and save them here.\n\nNext, you’ll be shown a list of suitable influencers.\n\nYou can click on individual influencers and view information about how often they post content, the estimated cost of advertising with them, and the number of views and subscribers they have. \n\nYou can select various influencers and create custom lists of people you’re interested in partnering with – these are stored in the ‘Lists’ tab. You can equally download your lists as spreadsheets.\n\nAdditionally, you can see the search volume and top most-watched videos for those keywords/search.\n\nWhy use Influencer Analytics to find YouTube influencers?\n\nInfluencer Analytics helps you:\n\nSave time searching for YouTube influencers\nFind contact information to reach out to influencers\nMake data-driven decisions about YouTube influencer partnerships\nDiscover new influencers before your competitors\nResearch influencers’ previous content, metrics, affordability, and compatibility all in one place\n\nThe Influencer Analytics platform can give you thousands of relevant influencers for your brand in seconds, and narrow your search according to your brand keywords and preferences.\n\nAnd, because Influencer Analytics is a comprehensive database of over 29 million influencers (across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitch), you can discover new players entering the space before your competitors. \n\nNot only does Influencer Analytics save you time and effort, it provides performance statistics that help you select the best influencer for your brand.\n\nWith recent data about the average number of views per post, likes per post, and links to influencers’ other social profiles, you can make an informed decision about who to work with. \n\nYou can also watch influencers’ content in the ‘Video’ tab without leaving the platform. By looking at creators’ past content you can decide if their style, messaging, and appeal aligns with what you want. \n\nLikewise, click on the ‘Sponsored Videos’ tab to view other brands that the influencer has promoted and assess the authenticity and outcomes of their previous partnerships – you can do so by checking audience sentiment in the comments and the number of likes for the video(s).\n\nEach video will show a cost breakdown too. This figure is based on a set of estimates around Cost Per Thousand (CPM) per region, engagement rate, account quality, and audience age, as well as the cost of paying the influencer for their service. \n\nIn short, it tells you what to expect in terms of production quality and payment for the particular influencer.\n\nOnce you’ve selected the influencer(s) you want to collaborate with, you can find their email address or contact them directly via YouTube. Any available contact details will be shown on the influencer page.\n\nUsing Audience Intelligence to Find YouTube Influencers\n\nThe Audience Intelligence app can show YouTube influencers whose audiences align with your target market.\n\nNote: Apart from showing you influencers, this tool also gives you demographic and interest data. That allows you to drill down into specific audience segments based on lifestyle preferences, online behavior, and content interaction patterns.\n\nTo find YouTube influencers start by going to your report and clicking the “Top Influencers” section.\n\nHere, you’ll see a list of accounts that your followers also follow. You can filter by country, audience interest group, and platform of interest.\n\nTo continue, click on the filters button in the top left corner of the table.\n\nThen, click the dropdown menu under the “Content Creators” section and select the checkmark beside “YouTube.”\n\nClick “Apply.”\n\nTip\n\nSelect the “Micro influencers” filter under the “influencers” section to see a list of YouTube influencers with a more focused following.\n\nReview the list of influencers the tool suggests based on your filters to find YouTube influencers.\n\nFor example, the generated list shows that the top YouTube micro-influencers for the Marriott brand focus on travel and storytelling content.\n\nUse the  Audience Intelligence app to find influencers with whom you can forge successful partnerships and reach the right audience.\n\nHow do I reach out to a YouTube influencer?\n\nBuilding a relationship with a YouTube influencer is a two-way process. Just as you have criteria to find your perfect match, you also have to demonstrate to influencers why you’re worth their time. \n\nWhen you begin to contact influencers, message them through their official channels or try to find a direct email.\n\nYou should personalize your message for each influencer, explaining why you’re interested in collaborating with them specifically, how your brand aligns with theirs, and what you can offer. \n\nBe professional and sincere but emphasize your unique selling points.\n\nKeep in mind that high-profile influencers will receive many proposals for brand partnerships, so they may not reply immediately or at all. Don’t be discouraged, follow up when appropriate, and cast a wide net so your campaign isn’t dependent on one influencer only.\n\nHere’s an example of an initial email to catch influencers’ attention:\n\nDear [influencer name],\n\nI’m [your name], [position] at [company name], [brief description of company]. We've been following your content on YouTube and think that your influence and expertise align perfectly with our brand values and objectives. \n\nWe’d love to discuss collaborating with you. We’re currently promoting [product/service/campaign] and believe it speaks to your audience because [value proposition]. \n\nWe have some ideas about what the partnership could look like, including [product reviews, tutorials, sponsored videos, giveaways, etc.]. In return, we can offer [budget, free products/services, exposure], as well as help to deliver even more value to your viewers.\n\nLet us know if you’re interested in working together and we can discuss details.\n\nThanks,\n\nA Match Made in Marketing\n\nYouTube influencers can boost your brand visibility and bring a new lens (literally) to your campaigns. With such a broad selection of influencers, finding the best person for you should be done with care and tools that streamline the process without compromising quality. \n\nUltimately, you should work with people that are compatible with, and can grow, your brand. With an authentic approach and smart toolkit, you’ll be on your way to finding the right YouTube influencer.\n\nFind YouTube Influencers\n\nwith Influencer Analytics\n\nTry for Free →",
