To maximize your results, consider the following aspects when doing keyword research for PPC. \n\n1. Search Intent\n\nYour target search terms and search intent should align with your campaign goals.\n\nTogether, these two factors determine the number of impressions and clicks your ad might receive based on the search ad algorithm. \n\nThey also play a role in your cost per click (CPC).\n\nSearch intent indicates the type of search a user is performing. \n\nIt’s generally grouped into four categories:\n\nInformational: The user wants to learn more about a topic or product\nNavigational: The user wants to find a specific website, page, or location\nCommercial: The user wants to research specific services, products, or brands\nTransactional: The user wants to take action, like make a purchase\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Overview to find a keyword’s search intent. \n\nClick “SEO” > Keyword Research” > “Keyword Overview” from the left-hand navigation of your Semrush tool dashboard. \n\nThen, enter your keyword, select the target location, and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see the search intent of your chosen keyword in the default “Overview” report that appears.\n\nKeywords with more commercial or transactional intent tend to generate more conversions. \n\nThe explanation is simple: \n\nVisitors with transactional intent are closer to making a purchase when they see and click on your ad.\n\nSo, if they search for “life jackets,” they’re probably shopping for one. \n\nBasically, they’re ready to buy. You just need to give them that final push to take action. \n\nOn the other hand, those searching for “swimming safety” or similar terms are probably looking for information. \n\nAt this point, their intent is informational and not transactional—so they’re less likely to purchase right away. What you should do is give them the information they need to move further down the sales funnel.\n\nFurther reading: ToFu, MoFu, BoFu: A Practical Guide to the Conversion Funnel\n\nSearch intent is also important because of Google’s Quality Score guidelines.\n\nAccording to Google Ads documentation, Quality Score is “a diagnostic tool meant to give you a sense of how well your ad quality compares to other advertisers.”\n\nIt’s a score from 1-10 Google assigns to your ads based on three factors:\n\nExpected click-through rate (CTR): How likely it is that a user will click on your ad based on the ad copy and keyword targeting\nAd relevance: How closely does your ad matches the search intent\nLanding page experience: Your website layout, performance, and overall experience\n\nA higher Quality Score means your ad is more likely to appear toward the top of the search engine results page (SERP). Your Ad Rank score is largely determined by your Quality Score and ad relevance. \n\nWhich means you’ll pay less for each click.\n\nThis is why it’s important to choose keywords with search intent that aligns with your offer.\n\n2. Search Volume\n\nSelect keywords with a high search volume and search intent that aligns with your campaign goals and your budget.\n\nThis helps to increase your clicks and conversions.\n\nSearch volume is a metric that estimates the number of times users search for a given keyword (or related keywords) over a certain period of time (usually monthly).\n\nYou can check the search volume of a keyword in the Keyword Overview tool (as well as Google’s Keyword Planner).\n\nFor example, in Keyword Overview, “life jackets” has an estimated monthly search volume of 18,100.\n\nYour ad appears when users search one of your targeted keywords. The search volume of the keywords you select determines how often your ad can display to users. \n\nThis is called impressions.\n\nIf your PPC ad shows up more often, then more users have a chance to click on it.\n\nThere is, however, an inverse relationship between search volume and buying intent. Keywords with higher search volume tend to be more general and therefore have lower conversion rates.\n\nThere are three categories of keywords:\n\nHead terms: Broad match keywords with high search volumes. They often consist of one or two words, like “shoes” or “life jackets.”\nMedium-tail: More specific keywords with good traffic. These usually consist of two to three words, such as “cheap business laptops” or “yoga health benefits,” and are more specific than broad match keywords. \nLong-tail: Detailed or specific keywords with lower search volumes. They often consist of three words or more, such as “women's blue running shoes” or “red life jackets for young children.”\n\nBroad match keywords are more generic than medium- and long-tail keywords. For example, search terms like “men’s shoes” or “hatha yoga” are not as specific as “men’s shoes size chart” or “hatha yoga classes near me.”\n\nTherefore, they tend to have a higher search volume and are more difficult to rank for. Which drives PPC costs up. \n\n3. CPC\n\nWhen it comes to keyword PPC research, you’ll want to choose keywords that align with your marketing budget and campaign goals.\n\nThe cost to run your PPC campaign is determined by the number of clicks your ads receive and the CPC.\n\nYou can find the CPC of specific keywords with the Keyword Overview tool. \n\nFor instance, the CPC of “life jackets” is $0.46.\n\nThis is the amount you get charged each time a user clicks on your ad. \n\nImportant: \n\nConsider the total amount you can afford to spend—including which specific keywords to bid on.\n\nLet’s say you have a budget of $100 per month to spend on ads. You might want to target keywords with a CPC of $0.50-$1 rather than $20 per click.\n\nGoogle Ads will determine where your ads appear in search results based on these factors. But that doesn’t mean you must pay an arm and a leg to get maximum visibility. \n\nInstead, optimize your copy and choose less competitive keywords. \n\nUltimately, the best keywords for your campaign will generate a greater return on investment (ROI). \n\nTest higher CPC keywords to see how their conversion rate compares to lower CPC keywords. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it’s possible that the five clicks you receive from $20 search queries generate more conversions or revenue than 100 clicks on $1 ads.\n\nNote\n\nYou can set budget and bid caps on your PPC advertising campaigns using platforms like Google Ads (formerly AdWords). So you won’t have to worry about going over budget if you target expensive keywords. Instead, you limit the number of impressions and clicks based on your budget.\n\nPPC vs. SEO Keyword Research\n\nPPC and SEO require keyword research and the process for both is similar. But the approach to evaluating and choosing keywords is often different. \n\nWhat makes a keyword “good”?\n\nSEO and content marketing are used to reach buyers throughout their purchase journey. \n\nSo before they’re ready to buy, informational keywords may be in order. \n\nIn line with the previous example, think “swimming safety,” “when to buy a new life jacket,” or “life jacket sizes.”\n\nPPC campaigns, on the other hand, generally use terms that drive immediate sales or conversions.\n\nBut what is PPC keyword research in the first place? \n\nThis process is all about identifying relevant keywords to bid on when running online advertising campaigns. \n\nFor example, an online store selling water sports equipment may target keywords like “buy life jackets online” or “life jackets for children.” \n\nDigital marketing strategies usually include both SEO and PPC campaigns. Each one requires its own approach to optimization to ensure a high ROI.\n\nWondering how to do keyword research for PPC on your own? \n\nTry this step-by-step approach.\n\nHow to Do PPC Keyword Research\nStep 1: Brainstorm Keywords\n\nDifferent keywords will yield different results in terms of advertising costs, campaign results, and visibility.\n\nWith that in mind, start the PPC keyword research process by looking up relevant keywords. \n\nFirst, consider what you already know.\n\nWhat products or services do you sell?\n\nWhat other words might a searcher use to describe your products or services?\n\nLet’s go back to the “life jackets” example.\n\nYou might come up with a list of keywords like:\n\nLife jackets\nLife vests\nLife preservers\nFloatation jackets\n\nDon’t worry about identifying all of the possible modifiers at this stage. It would be impossible to brainstorm every keyword that’s relevant to your niche.\n\nThese are just a starting point as you prepare for the next step.\n\nStep 2: Conduct Keyword Research\n\nUse your list of keywords to discover more keywords and conduct research. \n\nHead to the Keyword Magic Tool to find new keyword ideas. \n\nIn the left-hand navigation, click “Advertising” > “Keyword Research” > Keyword Magic Tool.”\n\nType in a keyword, enter your domain name, and click “Search.” \n\nNote\n\nAdding your domain is optional, but we strongly encourage it. This way, Keyword Magic Tool can provide AI-driven keyword insights specific to your website.\n\nKeyword Magic Tool will return keyword suggestions based on your initial keyword. \n\nReview the list to find the best keywords that align with your PPC campaign’s goals.\n\nConsider factors such as:\n\nSearch volume: Choose keywords that users search frequently. This ensures your ads have enough potential audience to justify your investment.\nPersonal Keyword Difficulty (PKD%): Look for keywords where your site can easily rank, indicated by a lower PKD%. This score reflects how tough the keyword competition is for your domain to appear in the top 10 results of search engine results pages (SERP).\nCPC: Assess the expense for each click on your ads. Maximize your budget by opting for keywords that offer a good balance between cost and conversion potential.\nCompetitive density: Look for keywords with fewer advertisers bidding. Lower competition can help you secure ad placements at reduced costs.\nSearch intent: Prioritize keywords with commercial (researching products) or transactional (ready to purchase) intent. Which are more likely to lead to sales.\n\nClick the checkbox next to each keyword you consider useful for your campaign.\n\nNote\n\nThere’s no need to select all of the misspelled versions of your keyword. Depending on your keyword match type, you’ll be able to target those specific keywords without adding them to your campaign. \n\nWhen you’re finished browsing through the suggestions, click “Add to keyword list” > “Create new empty list.” \n\nIn the text box that appears, type a name for your list and click the green check mark.\n\nAnd that’s how you build a list of keywords you want to target. \n\nAdd any further relevant keywords to that list, and later organize them by search intent, search volume, the ads they fit, and other criteria. \n\nType the next keyword from your original list (step one) in the search box at the top of Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nClick “Search” and repeat the process for each of your target keywords.\n\nNow, it’s time to expand your search by analyzing competitor keywords.\n\nFind Keywords For Your Ad Campaigns\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nStep 3: Analyze Competitor Keywords\n\nLearn what keywords other sites in your niche or industry are bidding on. These keywords could be valuable for your business, too.\n\nFor this, we’ll use the Advertising Research tool.\n\nFrom the left-hand navigation, go to Advertising” > “Market Analysis” > “Advertising Research.” \n\nIn the text box, type the URL of a competitor and click “Search.”\n\nTip\n\nNot sure what sites to research? Try typing keywords from steps one or two into Google search. See what sites advertise for the keywords you’re planning to target.\n\nYou’ll see an Advertising Research report for the website you typed in. Which opens the “Positions” tab by default.\n\nUnder “Paid Search Positions,” you’ll get a list of the keywords where the competing website’s ads appeared over a specific time period—such as 30 days. And each ad’s landing page URL.\n\nReview the keywords to see what might work for your campaign. Check any relevant keywords to export them into a separate document or spreadsheet. Like this:\n\nRepeat this process for other competing websites in your niche. \n\nTo find more competitors, head to the report’s “Competitors” tab. \n\nUnder “Paid Competitors,” you’ll see a list of websites the analyzed domain competes against in Google’s paid search results.\n\nTip\n\nAlso check your competitors’ ad landing pages and ad copy to see how they optimize for specific keywords. Head to the “Ads Copies” tab to view both.\n \n\nAfter you’ve analyzed relevant competitors, add their keywords to the list you created in step two. \n\nHere’s how.\n\nIn the left-hand navigation, click “Advertising” > “Keyword Research” > “Keyword Strategy Builder”(previously Keyword Manager).\n\nThen, click on the name of the keyword list you created in Keyword Magic Tool in step two. \n\nClick “Add keywords.”\n\nCopy and paste the keywords from your competitive analysis into the box. Then click “Add keywords.”\n\nYou should now have a fairly strong selection of relevant keywords to consider for your ad campaign. \n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nStep 4: Create a Final Keyword List\n\nKeyword groups organize related terms and topics to give your PPC campaign structure.\n\nNow that you have a list of keywords, use PPC Keyword Tool to analyze your keywords and form them into ad groups. \n\nOpen “Keyword Strategy Builder.” Find the name of the keyword list you created (steps two and three) and click on it.\n\nOn the Keyword Strategy Builder page, click “Send keywords.” Select “All” and “PPC Keyword Tool.” Then, click “Apply.” \n\nIf you see a window prompting you with a “Set up PPC Keyword Tool” button, click it.\n\nIn the text box on the PPC Keyword Tool page, type the URL of your website—this will be the name of your PPC project. Click “Set up.”\n\nYou’ll see the “Add keywords” window. Click “Manually.” \n\nNow, type one of your keywords into the text box—it doesn’t matter which one. Click “Add.”\n\nClick “Location.”\n\nClick the “Country” drop-down menu and select the country. \n\nIf your ads target a specific region or city, select them from the relevant drop-down menus. Then click “Start PPC Keyword Tool.”\n\nNow, go back to the “Keyword Strategy Builder” page to send your keywords. \n\nAt this point, you’ll get a prompt to “Send To PPC Keyword Tool.” \n\nFrom the drop-down menus, select the website project that you just created. Then, choose “Default campaign” and “Default group” under “Campaign” and “Group.” Click “Send keywords.”\n\nYou should see a message that says “Successful.” Click “Go to PPC Keyword Tool.”\n\nFinally, click the URL of the website project you just created. \n\nYou’ll see your full keyword list inside the PPC Keyword Tool.\n\nCreate the Perfect Keyword List\n\nwith the PPC Keyword Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nStep 5: Create Keyword Groups\n\nOrganize your keywords into campaigns and ad groups to make it easier to track and manage your ad spend. \n\nAd groups allow you to structure your PPC campaigns in a way that aligns closely with your marketing objectives. Ensuring each group targets a specific audience or theme.\n\nThis strategic segmentation enhances your ad relevance and improves the efficiency of your spending.\n\nUse the PPC Keyword Tool to quickly create and adjust ad groups before you upload them into Google Ads.\n\nTo add keywords to a new group from the “PPC keyword tool” page, click “+ Group” from the list on the left.\n\nIn the text box, type the name of the new keyword group you’re creating, then click the check mark.\n\nSelect the checkbox next to each keyword you want to add to this group.\n\nClick “Actions” > “Move to group.”\n\nClick the “Group” drop-down menu from the “Move keywords to group” window that appears. Then, click the name of the group where you want to move the keywords. \n\nFinally, click “Move to group.”\n\nOrganize your keywords into groups that make it easy for you to track and manage them. \n\nFor instance, you can group keywords by:\n\nBy product or service: This makes it easier to tailor your ad copy and landing pages directly to user search intents\nBy customer intent: Separate keywords by the buying stage they represent, such as awareness, consideration, or decision. This helps target the right ads to the right audience at the right time.\nBy demographic: If your products appeal to different demographic groups, consider separating keywords by demographic indicators like age, gender, or location\n\nLet’s say you want to target different buyer personas. You can organize your keywords into categories such as “women’s sports apparel,” “men’s casual wear,” and “children’s educational toys.”\n\nEach category should reflect the specific search behaviors and preferences of these groups. Allowing you to tailor your ads for maximum relevance and impact.\n\nStep 6: Adjust Keyword Matching and Negative Keywords\n\nChoose the correct keyword matching strategy and add negative keywords to your campaigns to help protect your ad budget.\n\nDepending on the type of keyword match you choose, your ads could show up for a variety of keyword searches. Negative keywords tell Google Ads when not to display your ads.\n\nFirst, let’s dive into the keyword match types.\n\nThere are three main match options in Google Ads:\n\nBroad match: Matches any keyword or search phrase that Google considers to be closely related to the term you’re targeting. For example, “life jackets” might match “life vests” and “water flotation devices.”\nPhrase match: Matches any search query that contains your target phrase, even if it has additional words before or after. It’ll also match slightly modified variations of the same terms (e.g., “life jackets” might match “children’s life jackets” and “red life vests”).\nExact match: Only matches the exact query or synonyms as you’ve described them. In this case, you might specify “life jackets” and “life vests.”\n\nChange the match type for keywords on your list using the PPC Keyword Tool. \n\nIn the left-hand navigation, click “Advertising” > “PPC Keyword Tool,” and click on your project of choice. \n\nThen, click the drop-down navigation from the “Match type” column. (By default, it will say “Broad match.”) Click on another match type from the list. \n\nKeywords that we do not want to trigger ads in our campaigns are called negative keywords. \n\nIn the PPC Keyword tool:\n\nClick the “Negatives” toggle. Then click “+ Negatives” > “Manually.”\n\nIn the text box, type or paste a list of negative keywords. Click “Add.” When you’re done adding keywords, click “Add keywords.”\n\nConsider adding negative keywords for things like:\n\nBrand names that you don’t sell (e.g., “nike”)\nTypes or options you don’t offer (e.g., “child”)\nPeople searching for coupons, deals, or freebies (e.g., “coupon,” “free tools”)\n\nUse the cross-group negatives feature in the PPC Keyword Tool to automatically generate negative keyword suggestions. This helps you avoid overlap between your ad groups and campaigns. \n\nTo do this, click the “Cross-group negatives” button.\n\nWhen your campaign is running, you’ll see a list of search terms in your Google Ads account that triggered your ads. Use the data from the search terms report to add negative keywords.\n\nThis helps to improve campaign performance by excluding unintentional placements.\n\nStep 7: Export Your PPC Keyword Campaign\n\nSemrush’s PPC Keyword Tool makes it easy to export your keyword lists and import them into Google Ads. \n\nIn the top-right corner, click the “Export data” button. Choose “All.” \n\nSelect the campaign from the drop-down menu. Then, choose “Keywords + Negatives” from the “Report” drop-down menu. Click “Export to CSV.”\n\nSave the file to your local drive.\n\nNow, let’s upload it to Google Ads. \n\nOpen Google Ads Editor. \n\nNote\n\nIf you don’t have Google Ads Editor installed, download it from the Google Ads Editor page. Launch it and sign in.\n\nGo to “Account” > “Import” > “From file.”\n\nLocate, select, and upload the CSV file you saved earlier. Google Ads Editor will process the CSV file.\n\nReview possible errors and make the necessary adjustments. This may involve setting the default max. CPC, max. CPM, etc.\n\nOnce done, review the changes and complete the setup.\n\nThis will integrate your newly refined keywords into your Google Ads campaigns.\n\nStep 8: Monitor Your Campaigns and Update Your Keyword Lists\n\nKeyword research doesn’t stop when you launch your Google Ads campaign.\n\nBecause you pay for every click you receive, you want to continuously monitor the keywords that trigger your ads. \n\nHere are some key metrics and aspects you should focus on:\n\nConversion rate: Measure how often a click on your ad leads to a conversion\nCPC: Monitor how much you are paying for each click. An increasing CPC could indicate increased competition or changes in bidding strategy.\nWasted spend: Check for keywords that cost money but do not lead to conversions. Adding these as negative keywords can reduce waste.\nQuality Score: Google rates the quality and relevance of your keywords and ads. It affects your CPC and ad position. A high Quality Score means your ad meets your audience’s needs more effectively, potentially lowering your costs.\n\nMonitoring the above will help you make informed decisions to refine your PPC strategy and improve campaign performance.\n\nGenerally, you should look at the search terms that trigger your ads in Google Ads. This will help you see what actual queries bring up your ads.\n\nThen, add new high-performing keywords based on your learnings. Or pause low-performing ones to optimize your ad spend.\n\nUse the Semrush PPC Keyword Tool, Google Ads Editor, or Google Keyword Planner to update your campaign.\n\nPPC Keyword Research FAQs\nDoes PPC Affect SEO?\n\nNo. Running PPC campaigns does not directly impact your site’s organic rankings and SEO. But many companies use both strategies for a comprehensive approach to digital marketing.\n\nIs PPC Cheaper Than SEO?\n\nThere are too many factors to say for sure which strategy is cheaper.\n\nFor PPC campaigns, you must consider the cost to conduct research, develop a strategy, and run the ads. Then add in what you pay for each click.\n\nWith SEO, there are costs for experts to develop and execute a long-term strategy. Plus things like content writing, design, and website UX.\n\nIs PPC Easier Than SEO?\n\nPPC outcomes are often more predictable than SEO. But that doesn’t always make it easier.\n\nWhile the basic process of setting up and running campaigns may seem simple, competition can be fierce. And there are algorithms and Ad Rank calculations to understand in order to optimize your campaign performance. \n\nHow Do I Find Good PPC Keywords?\n\nSimilar to SEO keyword research, PPC keyword research requires some technical know-how and the right tools. \n\nFor starters, use a tool like Google Keyword Planner or Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to do keyword research for PPC campaigns. \n\nAfter that, follow the steps outlined in our PPC keyword research guide to get your strategy right.\n\nWhich Tool Is Used for PPC Keywords?\n\nSemrush offers a suite of PPC keyword research tools. Keyword Overview, the Keyword Magic Tool, and the PPC Keyword Tool help you uncover and analyze high-performing keywords. \n\nThese comprehensive PPC keyword research tools allow you to explore potential keywords, understand competitive metrics, and refine your ad campaigns for better results.\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account to raise your PPC campaigns’ success rate.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign up Now →",
