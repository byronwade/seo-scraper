  "content": "What Is E-E-A-T?\n\nE-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) is a framework that Google’s human reviewers use to assess content quality.\n\nIt’s defined in Google’s Search Quality Rater Guidelines—the handbook that reviewers (known as Quality Raters) use to provide feedback on search results.\n\nTrustworthiness is the central, most important concept:\n\nGoogle wants to deliver search results that have strong E-E-A-T. To protect its users from harm and give them the best possible experience.\n\nThis is especially important when it comes to Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) topics—i.e., topics that can affect users’ well-being. Such as health and finance.\n\nSo, if Quality Raters find that results have low E-E-A-T, Google may try to improve its ranking algorithms. \n\nWhat’s the Difference Between E-E-A-T and E-A-T?\n\nIn December 2022, Google changed E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) to E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness).\n\nIn other words, it added an “E” for “Experience.”\n\nGoogle likely did this so that Quality Raters could better evaluate the quality of search results. Because it recognizes the value that first-hand experience can add to content.\n\nFor example, product reviews are more trustworthy when the reviewer has used the product themselves.\n\nWe’ll talk more about the different elements of E-E-A-T next.\n\nWhy Is E-E-A-T Important for SEO?\n\nE-E-A-T is important for search engine optimization (SEO) because it helps you create quality content that performs well in Google results. (And performs well with users.)\n\nTo clarify, E-E-A-T is not a confirmed direct factor in Google’s ranking formula. \n\nBut improving your E-E-A-T helps you align with Google’s definition of a good search result. \n\nLet’s break down the elements of E-E-A-T guidelines and why they matter:\n\nExperience\n\nFirst-hand experience with the subject matter allows you to provide:\n\nTried-and-tested advice\nAuthentic insights\nUnique opinions\n\nSo, it’s often crucial in creating quality content.\n\nConsider this review for the board game Wingspan.\n\nThe author talks about their personal experiences. And provides unique product photos.\n\nThis experience allows them to create more insightful, unique content.\n\nIf the writer hadn’t played the game, users wouldn’t trust their opinions on it. And Google wouldn’t want to rank their review highly.\n\nExpertise\n\nExpertise refers to your knowledge, skills, and credentials.\n\nFor example, this health article is reviewed by a medical doctor:\n\nAs a result, users are more likely to trust the information and advice provided. And Google may be more confident in ranking the content higher.\n\nThe level of expertise required to create quality content depends on the page’s topic and purpose.\n\nFor example, people searching for money-saving tips don’t always want advice from financial advisors (Expertise). Sometimes, they want real-life examples of strategies that worked for their peers (Experience). \n\nThat’s part of why pages like the one below (from Reddit, a popular forum-based social media site) can rank highly:\n\nAuthoritativeness\n\nAuthoritativeness refers to your reputation as a reliable source.\n\nOne way that Google gauges authoritativeness is by looking at your backlinks (links to your site from other sites). The higher the quantity, quality, and relevancy of backlinks, the more authoritative your site is perceived to be.\n\nFor example, WebMD is a well-regarded medical site. \n\nBacklink Analytics data shows it has backlinks from more than 616K domains. Including reputable sites like apple.com and bbc.com:\n\nYou can get an idea of your own authoritativeness with Semrush’s Authority Score (AS) metric. The higher the score out of 100, the stronger your backlink profile.\n\nEnter your domain into Backlink Analytics and click “Analyze.”\n\nThen, refer to the Authority Score section:\n\nTip\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get more high-quality backlinks is with Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nNote: Backlinks are a key way to assess a website’s perceived authority, but they are not the only way. For example, Quality Raters may be instructed to look at what others say about a website’s authority.\n\nTrustworthiness\n\nTrustworthiness is informed by experience, expertise, and authoritativeness. But it’s also about protecting visitors from potential harm and giving them confidence in your website/content.\n\nSo, you should ensure that: \n\nYour website is secure\nYour content is accurate, truthful, and up to date\nUsers can get help if required\nYou have relevant certifications, credentials, etc.\n\nTake AnnualCreditReport.com.\n\nIt’s the only site authorized by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to provide free credit reports. And the site takes many measures to keep users safe.\n\nThis helps the website establish a high level of trust.\n\nHow to Improve Your E-E-A-T\n\nHere are six practical ways to improve your site’s E-E-A-T for SEO:\n\nCreate Helpful Content\n\nCreate content that helps target audiences and showcases your brand’s expertise.\n\nThat way, you can grow authority in your field.\n\nFor example, REI is an outdoor apparel retailer. But it also shares lots of valuable advice about camping, hiking, climbing, etc.\n\nAs a result, REI has strengthened its reputation as an outdoors specialist.\n\nYou can find content ideas for your site with Semrush’s Topic Research tool.\n\nEnter a topic related to your expertise. Then, select your country and click “Get content ideas.”\n\nThe tool will provide a list of content ideas.\n\nClick “Show more” on any idea to see:\n\nSubtopic Volume: The average number of monthly searches for the subtopic keyword\nDifficulty: How hard the subtopic keyword is to rank for on a percentage scale\nTopic Efficiency: A measure of subtopic volume relative to its difficulty (higher = better)\nHeadlines: The titles of popular webpages related to this subtopic\nQuestions: Commonly searched questions related to the subtopic\n\nGet Content Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nFollow Strict Editorial Standards\n\nEditorial standards are the rules you follow when creating content for your site. And it’s wise to design them with E-E-A-T in mind. So you can consistently create quality content.\n\nFor example, here’s a snapshot of our editorial standards for the Semrush blog:\n\nHere are some quick tips for success:\n\nEnsure content is fact-checked and proofread by someone other than the writer \nCreate a style guide that defines the writing style you want to adopt\nDefine how information should be sourced and cited\nDetermine how frequently your content should be reviewed and updated\nMake sure creators use available tools to their advantage\nEnsure everyone on your team is aware of your editorial standards\n\nWith Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant, you can ensure your content is well-written, well-optimized, and original.\n\nThe tool scores your draft based on readability, originality, SEO, and tone of voice. And highlights any issues you might need to address:\n\nIf you need help improving your score, the Smart Writer provides a variety of AI-powered features:\n\nBuild Your Brand Reputation\n\nYour brand’s reputation impacts the perceived trustworthiness of your content and site overall. So, try to get positive online exposure. \n\nThere are a number of tactics you can try:\n\nDigital PR: Create stories around your brand and get journalists to cover them\nInfluencer marketing: Incentivize influencers to promote your brand to their audiences \nGuest posting: Write expert articles for other sites in your niche\nSocial media management: Build relationships with your audience through social platforms\nLink building: Encourage relevant, high-quality sites to link to your content\n\nFor example, Patagonia launched a wetsuit recycling program that led to positive coverage on reputable websites:\n\nThis may help users—and Google—view the brand as more trustworthy.\n\nTo track perceptions about your brand online, use the Brand Monitoring app. It finds references to your brand name and categorizes them based on sentiment:\n\nSign up for alerts about new negative mentions. So you can take corrective action quickly.\n\nAnd read our guide to online reputation management to learn more about protecting your brand’s image.\n\nCredit Your Content Creators\n\nCrediting the people who create your content can be a great way to build trust with readers.\n\nFor example, we name the writer and contributors on each blog post:\n\nAnd these names link through to bio pages with more detailed information.\n\nLike this:\n\nThese pages allow us to showcase our team’s credentials and past work. So, their experience and expertise is apparent.\n\nIf your writers don’t have the knowledge required to create quality content on your chosen topic, ask other members of your team to contribute. \n\nOr consider seeking outside help—experts may be willing to share their insights in exchange for exposure on your site.\n\nUse Credible Sources\n\nGet your information from trustworthy sources. Because there’s a lot of misinformation on the internet, and spreading it will damage your E-E-A-T.\n\nIt’s also best practice to link to your sources. So readers know you’ve done your research and can verify your claims for themselves.\n\nFor example, Healthline cites the academic journals it uses:\n\nLeverage User-Generated Content\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is content created by website/platform users rather than brands. \n\nFor example, Amazon displays videos, photos, reviews, and Q&As from its customers:\n\nUGC can help you build trust because it can prove that you have happy customers. And allow visitors to learn from each other’s experiences.\n\nYou can prompt users to create UGC by:\n\nBuilding UGC interfaces into your website (e.g., Amazon’s Q&A section)\nSending review request emails to customers\nRunning contests that require users to create content\nStart Building Your E-E-A-T\n\nBuilding E-E-A-T can be a daunting prospect. But there are lots of tools that can help.\n\nWith your free Semrush account, you can:\n\nFind content ideas with the Topic Research tool\nGrow your site authority with the Link Building Tool\nWrite better content with the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nAnd much more.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
