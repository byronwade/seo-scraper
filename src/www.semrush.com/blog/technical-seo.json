  "content": "What Is Technical SEO?\n\nTechnical SEO is about improving your website to make it easier for search engines to find, understand, and store your content. \n\nIt also involves user experience factors. Such as making your website faster and easier to use on mobile devices.\n\nDone right, technical SEO can boost your visibility in search results.\n\nIn this post, you’ll learn the fundamentals and best practices to optimize your website for technical SEO.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\nWhy Is Technical SEO Important?\n\nTechnical SEO can make or break your SEO performance. \n\nIf pages on your site aren’t accessible to search engines, they won’t appear in search results—no matter how valuable your content is.\n\nThis results in a loss of traffic to your website and potential revenue to your business.\n\nPlus, a website’s speed and mobile-friendliness are confirmed ranking factors.\n\nIf your pages load slowly, users may get annoyed and leave your site. User behaviors like this may signal that your site doesn’t create a positive user experience. As a result, search engines may not rank your site well.\n\nTo understand technical SEO better, we need to discuss two important processes: crawling and indexing.\n\nUnderstanding Crawling and How to Optimize for It\n\nCrawling is an essential component of how search engines work. \n\nCrawling happens when search engines follow links on pages they already know about to find pages they haven’t seen before.\n\nFor example, every time we publish new blog posts, we add them to our main blog page.\n\nSo, the next time a search engine like Google crawls our blog page, it sees the recently added links to new blog posts.\n\nAnd that’s one of the ways Google discovers our new blog posts.\n\nThere are a few ways to ensure your pages are accessible to search engines:\n\nCreate an SEO-Friendly Site Architecture\n\nSite architecture (also called site structure) is the way pages are linked together within your site.\n\nAn effective site structure organizes pages in a way that helps crawlers find your website content quickly and easily.\n\nSo, ensure all the pages are just a few clicks away from your homepage when structuring your site.\n\nLike this:\n\nIn the site structure above, all the pages are organized in a logical hierarchy.\n\nThe homepage links to category pages. And the category pages link to individual subpages on the site.\n\nThis structure also reduces the number of orphan pages.\n\nOrphan pages are pages with no internal links pointing to them, making it difficult (or sometimes impossible) for crawlers and users to find them.\n\nIf you’re a Semrush user, you can easily find whether your site has any orphan pages.\n\nSet up a project in the Site Audit tool and crawl your website.\n\nOnce the crawl is complete, navigate to the “Issues” tab and search for “orphan.”\n\nThe tool shows whether your site has any orphan pages. Click the blue link to see which ones they are.\n\nTo fix the issue, add internal links on non-orphan pages that point to the orphan pages.\n\nFind Orphan Pages\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nSubmit Your Sitemap to Google\n\nUsing an XML sitemap can help Google find your webpages.\n\nAn XML sitemap is a file containing a list of important pages on your site. It lets search engines know which pages you have and where to find them.\n\nThis is especially important if your site contains a lot of pages. Or if they’re not linked together well.\n\nHere’s what Semrush’s XML sitemap looks like:\n\nYour sitemap is usually located at one of these two URLs:\n\nyoursite.com/sitemap.xml\nyoursite.com/sitemap_index.xml\n\nOnce you locate your sitemap, submit it to Google via Google Search Console (GSC).\n\nSide note\n\nIf you don’t already have GSC set up, read this guide to activate it for your site.\n\nGo to GSC and click “Indexing” > “Sitemaps” from the sidebar. \n\nThen, paste your sitemap URL in the blank field and click “Submit.”\n\nAfter Google is done processing your sitemap, you should see a confirmation message like this:\n\nUnderstanding Indexing and How to Optimize for It\n\nOnce search engines crawl your pages, they then try to analyze and understand the content on those pages.\n\nAnd then the search engine stores those pieces of content in its search index—a huge database containing billions of webpages.\n\nYour webpages must be indexed by search engines to appear in search results.\n\nThe simplest way to check whether your pages are indexed is to perform a “site:” operator search.\n\nFor example, if you want to check the index status of semrush.com, you’ll type “site:www.semrush.com” into Google’s search box.\n\nThis tells you (roughly) how many pages from the site Google has indexed.\n\nYou can also check whether individual pages are indexed by searching the page URL with the “site:” operator.\n\nLike this:\n\nThere are a few things you should do to ensure Google doesn’t have trouble indexing your webpages:\n\nUse the Noindex Tag Carefully\n\nThe “noindex” tag is an HTML snippet that keeps your pages out of Google’s index.\n\nIt’s placed within the <head> section of your webpage and looks like this:\n\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">\n\nIdeally, you would want all your important pages to get indexed. So use the noindex tag only when you want to exclude certain pages from indexing. \n\nThese could be:\n\nThank you pages\nPPC landing pages\n\nTo learn more about using noindex tags and how to avoid common implementation mistakes, read our guide to robots meta tags.\n\nImplement Canonical Tags Where Needed\n\nWhen Google finds similar content on multiple pages on your site, it sometimes doesn’t know which of the pages to index and show in search results. \n\nThat’s when “canonical” tags come in handy.\n\nThe canonical tag (rel=\"canonical\") identifies a link as the original version, which tells Google which page it should index and rank.\n\nThe tag is nested within the <head> of a duplicate page (but it’s a good idea to use it on the main page as well) and looks like this:\n\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://example.com/original-page/\" />\nAdditional Technical SEO Best Practices\n\nCreating an SEO-friendly site structure, submitting your sitemap to Google, and using noindex and canonical tags appropriately should get your pages crawled and indexed. \n\nBut if you want your website to be fully optimized for technical SEO, consider these additional best practices.\n\n1. Use HTTPS\n\nHypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a secure version of hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).\n\nIt helps protect sensitive user information like passwords and credit card details from being compromised.\n\nAnd it’s been a ranking signal since 2014.\n\nYou can check whether your site uses HTTPS by simply visiting it. \n\nJust look for the “lock” icon to confirm.\n\nIf you see the “Not secure” warning, you’re not using HTTPS.\n\nIn this case, you need to install a secure sockets layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) certificate.. \n\nAn SSL/TLS certificate authenticates the identity of the website. And establishes a secure connection when users are accessing it.\n\nYou can get an SSL/TLS certificate for free from Let’s Encrypt.\n\nNote\n\nOnce your website moves over to HTTPS, ensure you add redirects from the HTTP to the HTTPS version of your website. This will redirect all the users visiting your HTTP version to the secure, HTTPS version of your site. \n\n2. Find & Fix Duplicate Content Issues\n\nDuplicate content is when you have the same or nearly the same content on multiple pages on your site.\n\nFor example, Buffer had these two different URLs for pages that are nearly identical:\n\nhttps://buffer.com/resources/social-media-manager-checklist/\nhttps://buffer.com/library/social-media-manager-checklist/\n\nGoogle doesn’t penalize sites for having duplicate content.\n\nBut duplicate content can cause issues like:\n\nUndesirable URLs ranking in search results\nBacklink dilution\nWasted crawl budget\n\nWith Semrush’s Site Audit tool, you can find out whether your site has duplicate content issues.\n\nStart by running a full crawl of your site and then going to the “Issues” tab.\n\nThen, search for “duplicate content.” \n\nThe tool will show the error if you have duplicate content. And offer advice on how to address it when you click “Why and how to fix it.”\n\nFind and Fix Duplicate Content Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Make Sure Only One Version of Your Website Is Accessible to Users and Crawlers\n\nUsers and crawlers should only be able to access one of these two versions of your site:\n\nhttps://yourwebsite.com\nhttps://www.yourwebsite.com\n\nHaving both versions accessible creates duplicate content issues.\n\nAnd reduces the effectiveness of your backlink profile. Because some websites may link to the www version, while others link to the non-www version.\n\nThis can negatively affect your performance in Google.\n\nSo, only use one version of your website. And redirect the other version to your main website.\n\n4. Improve Your Page Speed\n\nPage speed is a ranking factor both on mobile and desktop devices.\n\nSo, make sure your site loads as fast as possible. \n\nYou can use Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool to check your website’s current speed.\n\nIt gives you a performance score from 0 to 100. The higher the number, the better.\n\nHere are few ideas for improving your website speed:\n\nCompress your images—Images are usually the biggest files on a webpage. Compressing them with image optimization tools like ShortPixel will reduce their file sizes so they take as little time to load as possible.\nUse a content distribution network (CDN)—A CDN stores copies of your webpages on servers around the globe. It then connects visitors to the nearest server, so there’s less distance for the requested files to travel. \nMinify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files—Minification removes unnecessary characters and whitespace from code to reduce file sizes. Which improves page load time.\n5. Ensure Your Website Is Mobile-Friendly\n\nGoogle uses mobile-first indexing. This means that it looks at mobile versions of webpages to index and rank content.\n\nSo, make sure your website is compatible on mobile devices.\n\nTo see if that’s the case for your site, use the same PageSpeed Insights tool.\n\nOnce you run a webpage through it, navigate to the “SEO” section of the report. And then the “Passed Audits” section.\n\nHere, you’ll see whether mobile-friendly elements or features are present on your site:\n\nMeta viewport tags—code that tells browsers how to control sizing on a page’s visible area\nLegible font sizes\nAdequate spacing around buttons and clickable elements\n\nIf you take care of these things, your website is optimized for mobile devices.\n\n6. Use Breadcrumb Navigation\n\nBreadcrumb navigation (or “breadcrumbs”) is a trail of text links that show users where they are on the website and how they reached that point. \n\nHere’s an example:\n\nThese links make site navigation easier.\n\nHow?\n\nUsers can easily navigate to higher-level pages without the need to repeatedly use the back button or go through complex menu structures.\n\nSo, you should definitely implement breadcrumbs. Especially if your site is very large. Like an ecommerce site.\n\nThey also benefit SEO.\n\nThese additional links distribute link equity (PageRank) throughout your website. Which helps your site rank higher.\n\nIf your website is on WordPress or Shopify, implementing breadcrumb navigation is particularly easy.\n\nSome themes may include breadcrumbs out of the box. If your theme doesn’t, you can use the Yoast SEO plugin and it will set up everything for you.\n\n7. Use Pagination\n\nPagination is a navigation technique that’s used to divide a long list of content into multiple pages. \n\nFor example, we’ve used pagination on our blog.\n\nThis approach is favored over infinite scrolling.\n\nIn infinite scrolling, content loads dynamically as users scroll down the page. \n\nThis creates an issue for Google. Because it may not be able to access all the content that loads dynamically.\n\nAnd if Google can’t access your content, it won’t appear in search results.\n\nImplemented correctly, pagination will reference links to the next series of pages. Which Google can follow to discover your content.\n\nLearn more: Pagination: What Is It & How to Implement It Properly\n\n8. Review Your Robots.txt File\n\nA robots.txt file tells Google which parts of the site it should access and which ones it shouldn’t.\n\nHere’s what Semrush’s robots.txt file looks like:\n\nYour robots.txt file is available at your homepage URL with “/robots.txt” at the end. \n\nHere’s an example: yoursite.com/robots.txt\n\nCheck it to ensure you’re not accidentally blocking access to important pages that Google should crawl via the disallow directive. \n\nFor example, you wouldn’t want to block your blog posts and regular website pages. Because then they’ll be hidden from Google.\n\nFurther reading: Robots.txt: What It Is & How It Matters for SEO\n\n9. Implement Structured Data\n\nStructured data (also called schema markup) is code that helps Google better understand a page’s content.\n\nAnd by adding the right structured data, your pages can win rich snippets.\n\nRich snippets are more appealing search results with additional information appearing under the title and description.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nThe benefit of rich snippets is that they make your pages stand out from others. Which can improve your click-through rate (CTR).\n\nGoogle supports dozens of structured data markups, so choose one that best fits the nature of the pages you want to add structured data to.\n\nFor example, if you run an ecommerce store, adding product structured data to your product pages makes sense.\n\nHere’s what the sample code might look like for a page selling the iPhone 15 Pro:\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n\"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\", \n\"@type\": \"Product\", \n\"name\": \"iPhone 15 Pro\",\n\"image\": \"iphone15.jpg\",\n\"brand\": {\n\"@type\": \"Brand\",\n\"name\": \"Apple\"\n},\n\"offers\": {\n\"@type\": \"Offer\",\n\"url\": \"\",\n\"priceCurrency\": \"USD\",\n\"price\": \"1099\",\n\"availability\": \"https://schema.org/InStock\",\n\"itemCondition\": \"https://schema.org/NewCondition\"\n},\n\"aggregateRating\": {\n\"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n\"ratingValue\": \"4.8\"\n}\n}\n</script>\n\nThere are plenty of free structured data generator tools like this one. So you don’t have to write the code by hand.\n\nAnd if you’re using WordPress, you canuse the Yoast SEO plugin to implement structured data.\n\n10. Find & Fix Broken Pages\n\nHaving broken pages on your website negatively affects user experience.\n\nHere’s an example of what one looks like:\n\nAnd if those pages have backlinks, they go wasted because they point to dead resources.\n\nTo find broken pages on your site, crawl your site using Semrush’s Site Audit. \n\nThen, go to the “Issues” tab. And search for “4xx.”\n\nIt’ll show you if you have broken pages on your site. Click on the “# pages” link to get a list of pages that are dead.\n\nTo fix broken pages, you have two options:\n\nReinstate pages that were accidentally deleted\nRedirect old pages you no longer want to other relevant pages on your site\n\nAfter fixing your broken pages, you need to remove or update any internal links that point to your old pages.\n\nTo do that, go back to the “Issues” tab. And search for “internal links.” The tool will show you if you have broken internal links.\n\nIf you do, click on the “# internal links” button to see a full list of broken pages with links pointing to them. And click on a specific URL to learn more.\n\nOn the next page, click the “# URLs” button, found under “Incoming Internal Links,” to get a list of pages pointing to that broken page.\n\nUpdate internal links pointing to broken pages with links to their updated locations.\n\nFind and Fix Broken Pages\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n11. Optimize for the Core Web Vitals\n\nThe Core Web Vitals are speed metrics that Google uses to measure user experience. \n\nThese metrics include:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)—Calculates the time a webpage takes to load its largest element for a user \nFirst Input Delay (FID)—Measures the time it takes to react to a user's first interaction with a webpage\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS)—Measures the unexpected shifts in layouts of various elements on a webpage\n\nTo ensure your website is optimized for the Core Web Vitals, you need to aim for the following scores:\n\nLCP—2.5 seconds or less\nFID—100 milliseconds or less\nCLS—0.1 or less\n\nYou can check your website’s performance for the Core Web Vitals metrics in Google Search Console.\n\nTo do this, visit the “Core Web Vitals” report.\n\nYou can also use Semrush to see a report specifically created around the Core Web Vitals.\n\nIn the Site Audit tool, navigate to “Core Web Vitals” and click “View details.”\n\nThis will open a report with a detailed record of your site's Core Web Vitals performance and recommendations for fixing any issues.\n\nFurther reading: Core Web Vitals: A Guide to Improving Page Speed\n\n12. Use Hreflang for Content in Multiple Languages\n\nIf your site has content in multiple languages, you need to use hreflang tags.\n\nHreflang is an HTML attribute used for specifying a webpage's language and geographical targeting. And it helps Google serve the correct versions of your pages to different users.\n\nFor example, we have multiple versions of our homepage in different languages. This is our homepage in English:\n\nAnd here’s our homepage in Spanish:\n\nEach of our different versions uses hreflang tags to tell Google who the intended audience is.\n\nThis tag is reasonably simple to implement.\n\nJust add the appropriate hreflang tags in the <head> section of all versions of the page.\n\nFor example, if you have your homepage in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, you’ll add these hreflang tags to all of those pages:\n\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"x-default\" href=\"https://yourwebsite.com\" />\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"es\" href=\"https://yourwebsite.com/es/\" />\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"pt\" href=\"https://yourwebsite.com/pt/\" />\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en\" href=\"https://yourwebsite.com\" />\n13. Stay On Top of Technical SEO Issues\n\nTechnical optimization isn't a one-off thing. New problems will likely pop up over time as your website grows in complexity.\n\nThat’s why regularly monitoring your technical SEO health and fixing issues as they arise is important.\n\nYou can do this using Semrush’s Site Audit tool. It monitors over 140 technical SEO issues.\n\nFor example, if we audit Petco’s website, we find three issues related to redirect chains and loops.\n\nRedirect chains and loops are bad for SEO because they contribute to a negative user experience.\n\nAnd you’re unlikely to spot them by chance. So, this issue would have likely gone unnoticed without a crawl-based audit.\n\nRegularly running these technical SEO audits gives you action items to improve your search performance.\n\nStay On Top of Technical SEO Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →",
