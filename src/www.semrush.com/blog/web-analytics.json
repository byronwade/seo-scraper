  "content": "What Is Web Analytics?\n\nWeb analytics is the process of working with website data to improve the user experience (UX) and site performance. And includes creating goals, collecting and analyzing data, and making decisions based on your analysis.\n\nDigital analysts, ecommerce specialists, UX designers, product managers, and content managers all rely on web analytics to perform their jobs.\n\nThe most widely used web analytics tool is Google Analytics. Here’s a snapshot of what the platform can show you:\n\nBut there are other products (which we’ll discuss later in the article) that can produce similar results. These types of analytics tools help marketers and analysts in several important ways.\n\nBenefits of Website Analytics\n\nWebsite analytics helps to make sense of your website and your online visitors. So you can continually improve performance.\n\nBelow are some of the specific ways you can benefit from using website analytics.\n\nUnderstand Your Audience\n\nWebsite analytics tells you how your website visitors interact with your site. And can help answer important questions like:\n\nWhich pages do visitors view the most?\nWhich pages are holding attention?\nWhich pages lose visitors?\nHow many visitors are coming for the first time vs. making a return visit?\nHow are visitors interacting with your site content?\n\nHere’s Google Analytics data showing the most-viewed pages on the Google Merchandise Store demo account. You can see page views, the number of unique visitors who have viewed those pages, and the average time they were actively engaged with the page.\n\nAs you learn more about your audience through data like this, you can craft better content and a better website experience.\n\nDetermine Your Top Conversion Actions\n\nGoogle says a conversion is any “user action that you count because you consider it important.” And what’s important depends on the purpose of the website.\n\nFor example, an online purchase is likely the most important conversion for an ecommerce website. But a form submission may be the most important conversion for a B2B company that wants to drive leads.\n\nWhatever the conversion is, you can record data about it and measure how efficient your site is in generating that specific action. Then, you can work to improve those conversion rates.\n\nHere you see the conversions for the Google Merchandise Store demo account. The 1,496 purchase conversions are undeniably the most important. But the view_item conversion (102,361 occurrences) and add_to_cart conversion (25,626 occurrences) are also important. \n\nWhen you compare those second two numbers, you can see that 25% of all item views translate to adding the item to a cart. That 25% can be used as a baseline, and the team can see if they can improve results from there. \n\nThe team might try to improve by adding customer reviews and video demos on product pages. Small improvements in conversion efficiency can make a big impact in the overall performance.\n\nManage Your Advertising Budget\n\nWeb analytics can tell you how many visits and conversions you get from various traffic sources. Like paid search ads, paid social ads, email marketing, and organic search.\n\nHere, you can see budget and conversion data from the Google Ads platform for a business that generates new clients through completed contact forms. \n\nThis search campaign has generated 92 conversions with an advertising cost of $1,877.75 during the time period in question. Combining those two metrics yields a cost per conversion of $20.41.\n\nThe current budget is $30.50 per day, and that can be adjusted as needed.\n\nWeb analytics data like this helps you make smarter decisions about your advertising budget. \n\nYou might choose to shift budget between multiple Google Ads campaigns. Or even to shift budget between Google Ads and Meta Ads if you saw different results in terms of conversion efficiency.\n\nNote\n\nGoogle Ads can integrate with analytics tools like Google Analytics and Semrush to help consolidate your data.\n\nFind Ways to Improve the User Experience\n\nWeb analytics can alert you to issues like your links breaking or going to the wrong destination. Or when the URL of a destination page changes, a webpage gets deleted, or a large image causes a page to load slowly.\n\nHere, you can see the internal link issues from Semrush’s Site Audit tool. \n\nThere aren’t currently any broken links. But if that ever changes, this report will quickly flag it. So any problem links can be fixed.\n\nPro tip\n\nThe report shows 255 instances of nofollow attributes (meaning the attribute tells search engines not to pass authority to the link) in internal links. Fixing those issues would allow more valuable link equity to pass as part of your internal linking strategy.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nIncrease SEO Potential and Drive More Organic Traffic\n\nIf you work in SEO, web analytics can help you measure the performance of your content and identify places for improvement.\n\nTools like Google Search Console show organic search data at the page level and the keyword level.\n\nYou can see that one of the keywords (or queries) for “fever blisters” for this website has dropped in rank from 14.9 to 19.9. And impression volume and click volume have declined. \n\nAn SEO analyst could quickly identify which page is associated with the drop and put together a focused plan to improve the ranking position for that particular keyword.\n\nTip\n\nSemrush’s Organic Traffic Insights integrates with platforms like Google Search Console to consolidate your organic traffic and keyword ranking data in a single place. To help you quickly uncover insights you can put into action.\n\nExamples of Metrics to Track Using Website Analytics\n\nMetrics are quantitative measurements that help you understand your analytics performance. \n\nThe specific web metrics you prioritize should rely on your company’s unique measurement goals. That said, the following metrics are broadly applicable and worth reviewing for most organizations.\n\nBoth metrics and dimensions are used to track your web analytics data. While metrics are quantitative measurements, dimensions are attributes that help you understand those quantitative metrics. \n\nYou’ll see how metrics and dimensions work together as you read below about sessions, users, and traffic sources.\n\nSessions and Users\n\nWhenever a user visits your website, it counts as a session.\n\nWhile sessions equate to visits, users count toward the number of unique visitors. \n\nFor example, let’s say the same user visited your site three times during a month. That would count as one user and three sessions in your web analytics data. \n\nHere we see data from Google Analytics for the Google Merchandise Store demo account showing 66,342 unique users accounting for 94,465 total sessions. \n\nYour traffic trend over time can be a useful indicator of site health, brand health, and overall top-of-the-funnel performance.\n\nTraffic Sources\n\nTraffic source is a dimension you can use to dive deeper into your web traffic metrics like session count and user count.\n\nBelow, you see the same user and session data that we saw in the preceding section. But now the data is broken down by the “Session default channel group” dimension (“channel group” is a way of organizing traffic sources in Google Analytics).\n\nAnd you can see that 25 users arrived at the site in the specified time frame via links from unpaid video sites like TikTok and YouTube.\n\nWith the help of this traffic dimension, you can prioritize your top performers and identify potential new opportunities from bottom performers. \n\nFor example, the Google Merchandise Store might have an opportunity to invest in their organic video channel. It only drives a small portion of total traffic, but the average engagement time per user is higher than anything else on the screen.\n\nNote\n\nIf you’re comfortable with using Looker Studio, you can build your own web analytics dashboard to combine your traffic data with data from other sources. \n\nViews\n\nWith the help of web analytics, you can analyze views to learn more about your most popular content.\n\nLet’s consider page-level detail from Google Analytics. Which can help guide content and design decisions.\n\nFor example, the /Google+Redesign/Stationery page generates a lot of interest (24,943 page views) but little engagement. The site merchandising team might compare that page against the /Google+Redesign/Apparel/Mens page (which has a much higher average engagement time) to see if there are improvements to be made.\n\nHow to Leverage Website Analytics\n\nAnalytics can help to power real business growth when used properly within the framework of an overall plan.\n\nLet’s say you run an online store. Here’s how you might use website analytics in your business.\n\nEstablish Business Goals and Website KPIs\n\nBefore looking into your data, identify your business goals and the specific key performance indicators (KPIs)—specific metrics you use to track progress toward your overall goals—that will help you accomplish your goals.\n\nLet’s say your goal is to generate $500,000 in revenue through your online store in the year ahead. So, your KPIs should be narrowly focused on the metrics that will help you reach that goal.\n\nOne of your two KPIs is to achieve an ecommerce conversion rate of 2.5%. Meaning that out of every 100 sessions, your site will generate 2.5 purchases on average. \n\nYou’re confident that you’ll be able to reach it because it’s in line with your industry average and your own site’s historical performance.\n\nYour annual traffic forecast is 160,000 sessions. If you continue that trend and achieve your 2.5% conversion rate KPI, your site will generate 4,000 purchases during the year.\n\nYour other KPI is to reach an average purchase amount (or average “basket size”) of $125. This is a slight increase over your historical averages, but you feel confident. Because you have a new website feature that recommends complementary products to customers and a new puzzle set that you believe some of your customers will be willing to add to their baskets.\n\nIf you can achieve your $125 average basket and your 2.5% ecommerce conversion rate, you know you’ll reach your annual sales target of $500,000.\n\nCollect Data\n\nOnce you define your goals and KPIs, you need the proper tracking tool to collect the data you need.\n\nYou decide to use Google Analytics since it can collect this data for you. Which it does through a tracking code that gets installed on your website.\n\nHere’s the tracking code that you need to set up Google Analytics. (Google Analytics tracking codes are the same except for the unique measurement ID that tracks your website.)\n\nYour Google Analytics property begins collecting data once the code is properly installed. \n\nYou’re very interested in your total website traffic, your purchase conversions, and your total revenue.\n\nWhen you look at your number of purchases and overall purchase revenue after two months, you see you’re ahead of schedule. You’ve already generated $115,489.67 in sales through 20.8% of the year. With your monthly sales relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, you’re forecasting to achieve annual sales of $554,347 ($115,489.67 / 20.8%)!\n\nAnd you can see that your average basket is driving performance. It’s $160.62 ($115.489.67 in total revenue / 719 purchases)—well above your $125 goal.\n\nYou’re happy about the positive sales trend, but you don’t yet understand why the results are so good. For that, you need to dig deeper into your data.\n\nAnalyze Data\n\nYou can move beyond top-level numbers to uncover useful insights by analyzing your data.\n\nWith analysis you move past “what happened” to thinking about “how” and “why” it happened. And make hypotheses about why you see certain behaviors, which allows you to understand your audience in a deeper way.\n\nIn your case, you know that your sales are trending above your annual goal and that your average basket size is helping. But you don’t yet know what’s causing that until you dig deeper into your product sales data.\n\nYou use Google Analytics to review the specific items that are performing well in your online store and you immediately see a big reason why performance has been so strong—the new puzzle set is even more popular than you predicted.\n\nIn fact, you can see from your Google Analytics data that it has generated roughly five times more revenue than the next highest item. You had only planned to sell 200 units for your entire year but have already sold 357 through the first two months.\n\nMany of your customers have been electing to add this item to their existing baskets through the automated cross-sell tool you had added to your site. \n\nNow, let’s go over what you can do to leverage that insight to improve your performance even more.\n\nMake Decisions to Improve Performance\n\nAfter analysis, you can make data-informed decisions to improve performance.\n\nYou’ve uncovered a surprisingly strong seller that has been performing well despite not getting much marketing support or prominent placement on your site. The performance has been entirely driven by your website tool that recommends products to your customers who have already added something to their carts.\n\nYou decide to do two things. First, you’re going to capitalize on the trending puzzle set by adding it to your email and social media marketing calendars. And by featuring it prominently on your homepage. \n\nSecondly, you arrange a meeting with your merchandise buying team to brainstorm other new product ideas that also might perform as complementary products. You know you aren’t guaranteed to replicate the sales boom of the puzzle set, but you have data now that shows what kind of success if possible.\n\nYou’ll be ready to make data-informed decisions like this after you’ve established your goals, implemented your web analytics tracking system, and analyzed your resulting data.\n\nWebsite Analytics Tools to Know\n\nLet’s review four of the most well-regarded tools and consider who should use them.\n\nFor even more tool comparisons, check out these 15 Google Analytics alternatives.\n\nSemrush\n\nSemrush is a comprehensive tool suite that integrates with other analytics platforms like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to generate actionable insights.\n\nWho Uses Semrush\n\nSemrush is great for those who have questions about their site health, keyword rankings, traffic trends, and how it all connects to overall performance.\n\nHere’s a snapshot of what you can see within the SEO Dashboard:\n\nGoogle Analytics\n\nGoogle Analytics is installed on your website using a JavaScript tracking code. The software collects data as users interact with your site.\n\nWho Uses Google Analytics\n\nGoogle Analytics is beneficial for anyone who has questions about where their visitors come from and what they do on their site. Or those who want to create and share reports about what’s happening.\n\nPiwik PRO\n\nPiwik PRO is installed on your website using a JavaScript tracking code. The software collects web interaction data as your users interact with your site.\n\nWho Uses Piwik PRO\n\nPiwik PRO is a good choice for people interested in the type of data that Google Analytics can provide but who have serious data privacy concerns.\n\nMicrosoft Clarity\n\nMicrosoft Clarity is installed on your website using a JavaScript tracking code. The software collects user experience data as your users interact with your site.\n\nWho Uses Microsoft Clarity\n\nThis tool is a good choice for companies that want to see click and scroll heatmaps, view session recordings, and identify situations where their web visitors seem frustrated.\n\nIn the screenshot below, you see a heatmap identifying the most clicked sections on a page. And you can filter to watch session recordings using the “View recordings” buttons to the left.\n\nMerging Tools to Find Performance Improvement Opportunities\n\nIf you want digital analytics to be more than just reporting data, you’ll need to make decisions that can improve your performance.\n\nOne way to do that is to use Google Analytics and Semrush together.\n\nLet’s say you run a B2B website and you use your blog pages to drive new leads for your sales team. You collect your leads through a form submission that you record as a conversion.\n\nThe first step is to identify which pages to work on to drive more of those conversions. Let’s see how to use Google Analytics data with Semrush for that.\n\nIdentify Target Pages for Improvement\n\nYou want a quick and easy way to evaluate the performance of your top pages and identify areas for improvement.\n\nYou can use Organic Traffic Insights in Semrush. It combines your Google Analytics engagement rate data along with additional data about conversion count and keyword data from Google Search Console and Semrush.\n\nHere’s what you see:\n\nYou quickly spot a page that drives a lot of conversions but is declining in traffic. You know that if you can turn around the declining traffic, you could expect even more conversions.\n\nAnalyze Bounce Rate, Sessions, and More\n\nwith the Organic Traffic Insights Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUsing Semrush to Power Organic Traffic\n\nYou’ve spotted a major opportunity on a blog post that’s seen a 39% drop in users who come from organic search.\n\nYou know your competitors write about similar topics, and your research confirms that two competitors have recently published blog posts on the same subject as this landing page. \n\nYou determine that you’ll need to target additional keywords within your page to give it more ranking opportunities.\n\nYou can find keyword opportunities in Semrush. \n\nHere’s how.\n\nFirst, you click on the 65 keywords linked in Organic Traffic Insights to see what keyword opportunities you may have on the page.\n\nYou spot an opportunity in the eight row on the keyword list. \n\nIt’s a relatively high-volume keyword with a low difficulty score. So, you work with your content team to create a new H2 on the page focused on this keyword.\n\nYou also use the Keyword Magic Tool to see if there are additional keyword ideas your team should target. By entering a seed term to uncover new keyword opportunities.\n\nAs you expand your blog post by adding additional H2s targeting relevant keywords, you give your page additional opportunities to rank and drive traffic. So, you’re on your way to turning around your declining traffic and boosting your conversions.\n\nGet Started with Web Analytics\n\nWeb analytics is far more than collecting data and sharing reports. It’s an ongoing process—and a commitment to making data-informed decisions.\n\nMarketers who embrace analytics tools and an analytical mindset can uncover new insights and opportunities to help power business results.\n\nReady to try out Semrush to generate your analytics insights?
