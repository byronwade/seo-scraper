  "content": "What Is a Competitive Matrix?\n\nA competitive matrix is a tool that helps you visually compare your company against competitors. To see how you stack up.\n\nIt typically features a grid or table that lists your brand and key competitors on one axis. And important market factors on the other. \n\nThere are many types of competitive matrices that show data in different ways.\n\nFor example, this is the Growth Quadrant from Semrush. It’s a competitor matrix you can generate using the Market Explorer tool.\n\nThis quadrant-based matrix helps you visualize your industry’s competitive landscape. And divides competitors into four categories:\n\nGame Changers\nLeaders\nNiche Players\nEstablished Players\n\nWe’ll explain what these categories mean later. And show you how to build this matrix using your competitors’ data. \n\nFirst, let’s explore the benefits of using a competitive matrix. \n\nTip\n\nGet your free competitive matrix templates and sign up for a free Semrush account to follow along with the steps in this guide. Credit card is not required.\n\nWhy Is Using a Competitive Matrix Important?\n\nA competitor analysis matrix provides competitive insights that help you gain an advantage in the market. \n\nThe matrix’s main purpose is to show where your company stands compared to your competitors. To be more aware of your (and your competitors’) strengths and weaknesses. \n\nThis can then be used to:\n\nStrategically position your brand: By seeing how your offerings stack up against competitors, you can find better ways to position your products or services. And highlight what makes you different and fill in any gaps in the market.\nMake informed decisions: With a clear view of the competitive landscape, you can make data-driven decisions about product development, marketing, and resource allocation\nPredict competitor moves: Understanding your competitors' strengths and weaknesses can help you anticipate their next moves. And stay ahead of them.\n\nIn short, a well-researched competitive analysis matrix provides you insights to confidently navigate fierce competition. Even in a perfectly competitive market—where most businesses sell identical products.\n\n5 Competitor Matrix Types with Examples and Templates\n\nThere are various types of competitive matrices, each for different use cases. You can choose one or more depending on your analysis goals.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the most popular types.\n\n1. Competitive Comparison Grid\n\nA competitor comparison grid (also called a competitive positioning matrix) is a framework that visualizes how customers perceive your company relative to your competitors. \n\nIt considers factors like price, quality, service, and innovation to help you understand your market position.\n\nTypically, it’s drawn using two axes that each represents a crucial success factor.\n\nLet's look at the G2 Grid for competitive intelligence tools as an example.\n\nImage Source: G2\n\nIt has “Market Presence” on the y-axis—which is calculated using G2’s scoring methodology that draws from a number of sources. And “Satisfaction” on the x-axis is based on user reviews.\n\nBased on these scores, companies are divided into four quadrants:\n\nLeaders: High user satisfaction and high market presence\nContenders: High user satisfaction and low market presence\nHigh Performers: Low user satisfaction and high market presence\nNiche: Low user satisfaction and low market presence\n\nYou can visualize the digital competitive landscape for your industry similarly with Semrush’s Growth Quadrant matrix.\n\nOpen the Market Explorer tool and click the “Find Competitors” tab. Then, enter your location and domain name, and click the “Research a market” button.\n\nScroll to the “Growth Quadrant” widget. \n\nYou’ll see your website’s positioning compared to competing sites. Like this:\n\nUsing the “Total Traffic” and “Total Traffic Growth, %” metrics, the websites are categorized as: \n\nLeaders: High-traffic sites with high growth rates\nEstablished Players: High-traffic sites with low growth rates\nGame Changers: Low-traffic sites with high growth rates \nNiche Players: Low-traffic sites with low growth rates\n\nYou can choose different metrics for comparison as well. \n\nJust click the drop-down menu next to “X-axis” and “Y-axis,” make your selections, and hit “Apply.”\n\nNow, see where you (and your main competitors) stand for your selected metrics.\n\nNote the key metrics where your competitors are stronger. And use the insights to plan your growth strategy.\n\nFurther reading: What Is a Competitive Analysis & How to Do It (With Template)\n\nAnalyze Your Market\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nSign up Now →\n2. Competitor Comparison Chart\n\nA competitor comparison chart (also called a competitive landscape chart) is typically a table used to compare your products, services, or tactics against those of your competitors. \n\nLike this:\n\nThis competitor matrix is especially useful for a broad competitive analysis. Because the side-by-side comparison gives you quick insights such as:\n\nThe strengths and weaknesses of your competitors’ go-to-market strategies\nYour competitors’ relative presence in specific marketing channels\nYour competitors’ most successful acquisition channels\n\nUse the competitive comparison chart template (the second tab) to create your own.\n\nYou can also use comparison charts for narrower analyses (e.g., product or feature comparisons).\n\nWhich can be useful for:\n\nProduct or service development: Identify gaps in the current market, improve your offerings, and establish a strong differentiator\nMarketing and sales: Fine-tune your messaging to highlight your unique value proposition \nStrategic decision-making: Guide decisions about pricing models, feature development, partnerships, and acquisitions\n\nOr, identify a handful of areas that are most relevant to your business to focus your analysis on. \n\nYou can use the competitive landscape chart template (the sixth tab) to do this. And edit the fields to fit your needs. \n\n3. Gartner's Magic Quadrant \n\nGartner’s Magic Quadrant compares how brands stack up in a specific technology market. And analyzes them on their ability to understand and influence the future of the market and their performance in key areas like market share, product capabilities, sales channels, and customer experience\n\nBased on the above factors, each company is placed into one of the following quadrants:\n\nLeaders: These are well-established brands with strong execution capabilities. And a clear vision for the future of the market.\nChallengers: These brands have adequate resources and a strong ability to execute. But they need to work on vision. \nVisionaries: These players have a solid vision and intellectual properties. However, they’re comparatively weak or slow in execution. \nNiche players: These brands serve only a specific market segment. Or have a limited product portfolio.\n\nOne example is Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for DevOps Platforms. And the data within it can help you make informed decisions.\n\nLet’s say your brand falls in the “Visionaries” quadrant. You have a disruptive idea but lack the resources to execute it. \n\nThat insight tells you where to focus. \n\nAnd you could consider joining hands with a business in the “Challengers” quadrant. Since they need what you have—vision—you may be able to negotiate a good partnership. \n\nJust remember that the Gartner Magic Quadrant Matrix is a snapshot. Not a definitive ranking.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse this tool in combination with other research methods. Vision and execution are crucial. But they aren’t the only factors to consider when making strategic decisions about investments, partnerships, or acquisitions. \n\n4. SWOT Analysis \n\nA strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) competitor analysis matrix evaluates a company’s internal strengths and weaknesses. Plus external opportunities and business threats. \n\nIt helps you: \n\nIdentify and use your strengths (e.g., strong brand awareness) to outperform competitors\nKnow and address your weaknesses (e.g., poor customer service). Before they cause damage.\nSpot and grab emerging opportunities (e.g., new market segments)\nForesee and avoid potential business threats (e.g., political instability)\n\nHere are some questions to help you get your SWOT analysis data:\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\n\t\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\n\nWhat do you do well?\nWhat have your customers or partners said they like about you?\nIn what areas do you outpace your competitors?\nWhat's unique about your business, products, or services?\nWhat assets do you own (intellectual property, proprietary technology, capital, etc.)?\n\t\nWhat can you improve?\nWhat are your customers or partners dissatisfied with?\nWhere do you fall behind your competitors?\nWhere are you lacking in knowledge or resources?\n\n\n\nOpportunities\n\n\t\n\nThreats\n\n\n\nWhat emerging trends can you take advantage of?\nWhich of your strengths might be valuable to potential partners?\nWhat adjacent markets might you tap into?\nAre there geographic locations with less competition?\n\t\nWhat is your competition doing?\nHow could your weaknesses leave you vulnerable?\nWhat market trends are you unprepared for?\nWhat economic or political issues could impact your business?\n\nGather your leadership team and brainstorm SWOT questions and answers. This way, you’ll get diverse perspectives from multiple stakeholders at your organization. \n\nThen, compile your results in this SWOT analysis template (the fourth tab). \n\nHere’s an example SWOT for a newly launched, fictional organic coffee brand called The Conscious Bean.\n\nFurther reading: SWOT Analysis: What It Is & How to Do It [Examples + Template]\n\n5. Competitive Profile Matrix\n\nA competitive profile matrix helps you benchmark your offering directly against major competitors. To provide a more nuanced view of how you compare overall.\n\nIt focuses on rating competitors on critical success factors (CSFs) by using a weighted scoring method. \n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nList three to four main competitors you want to evaluate\nDetermine your CSFs—these are key areas that drive success in your market. Like product or service quality, pricing, customer support, distribution network, or innovation. \nAssign weights between 0.0 (low importance) and 1.0 (high importance) to each CSF. The total weight must add up to 1.0.\nRate competitors across all CSFs on a scale of 1-4 or 1-5. A higher rating indicates stronger performance for that CSF.\nMultiply the weight by the competitor's rating for each CSF to get a score. Add individual CSF scores for each competitor. It’ll give you a total weighted score.\n\nHere’s a simplified competitive profile matrix example.\n\nHow do you interpret this table?\n\nThe company with the highest total score is typically the strongest. \n\nSo, make sure to examine how you rank in each CSF compared to others. And revise your strategy accordingly. \n\nUse this competitive profile matrix template (the fifth tab) for your analysis.\n\nHow to Create Your Own Competitive Matrix\n\nTo complete a matrix, you need to conduct competitor research and gather data—likely using competitive intelligence tools.\n\nWe’ll show you how.\n\nTip\n\nSign up for a free trial of Semrush to follow along with these instructions. \n\nElevate Your Digital Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\nStep 1. Identify Your Competitors \n\nStart with a list of all potential competitors—direct, indirect, and emerging players in your market. \n\nFind them using resources like:\n\nIndustry reports \nCompany websites and press releases\nCustomer review platforms\nSocial media and online communities\nTrade shows or conferences\nCustomer surveys\n\nOr simply head to Semrush’s Market Explorer tool and click “Find Competitors.”\n\nSelect your location, enter your website name, and hit “Research a market.”\n\nIn the default “Overview” tab, you’ll see “Market Summary.” It shows a list of key players. And their market share. \n\nScroll down to reach the “Growth Quadrant.”\n\nYou’ll see the competitive landscape along with competitors' positions in the market. \n\nNow, identify your quadrant (“Leaders,” “Established Players,” “Game Changers,” or “Niche Players”). And click “Domains” near the top right corner of “Growth Quadrant.” \n\nYou’ll see the full list of the competing domains in your market. \n\nScroll to the list of domains in your same quadrant and select a few for your analysis. \n\nNote\n\nFor more information on which competitors to choose for your analysis, read our guide to digital marketing competitor analysis. \n\nAnalyze Your Market\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nStep 2. Determine Comparison Factors\n\nNext, select comparison factors based on your competitive analysis goals. \n\nThey’ll guide your research. And help you choose the right competitive matrix type for your analysis. \n\nFor our example, we’ll look at the following factors:\n\nWebsite traffic data: Visits, unique visitors, purchase conversions, pages viewed per visit, visit duration, and bounce rate\nSocial media data: Followers/subscribers, posts/videos, and engagement rates\nDemographic, geographic, and socioeconomic data: Dominant age group, gender, income level, and main market\n\nThen, add you/your competitors and your comparison factors to a copy of the matrix template that works best for your situation. In this case, we recommend using the competitive landscape chart (the sixth tab). \n\nStep 3. Gather Data\n\nNow, you’ll need to collect the data that corresponds with your comparison factors to fill in the matrix. \n\nHere’s what that entails based on the ones we identified above:\n\nWebsite Traffic Data\n\nWe’ll use Semrush’s Traffic Analytics tool to get the website traffic data. \n\nOpen the tool and click “Check Competitors.”\n\nNext, select the location, enter your domain and your competitors’ domains, and click “Analyze.”\n\nYou’ll see the important website traffic metrics for the selected sites for the last full month (you can change the date range if you wish). So you can analyze your site’s performance against the competing domains. \n\nClick “Export to PDF” to get this data in your email. \n\nOr paste it directly into your template copy.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Traffic\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nSocial Media Data \n\nNow, let’s go over how to get competitors’ social media data using the Social Tracker tool (part of Semrush Social). It lets you track the social media activity and performance of up to 20 competitors. \n\nOpen the tool. And follow the Social Tracker configuration instructions.\n\nAt the top of the “Overview” tab, you’ll see the chosen competitor’s audience size, posting activity, and engagement on different social platforms. \n\nNote\n\nThe tool also allows you to dive into channel-specific reports for each competitor. For example, click the “Facebook” tab. To see more details about a competitor’s subscribers, posts, and engagement on Facebook. \n\nScroll to the “Comparison With Competitors'' widget to see how you stack up against your competitors.\n\nThe “Audience” tab shows the total number of followers or subscribers across the social platforms. Including the changes in the audience size. \n\nClick the “Activity” tab to see the total number of social posts of each competitor. For the selected period.\n\nSimilarly, analyze the total engagement.\n\nYou can now add this data to your competitive landscape chart. \n\nFurther reading: How to Uncover Your Competitor's Social Media Strategy\n\nStreamline Social Media Management\n\nwith a Semrush Social Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\nDemographic, Geographic, and Socioeconomic Data \n\nComparing demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic data can reveal valuable insights about your target audience.\n\nUse Semrush’s One2Target tool to find this information. \n\nEnter the same domain names and select the location. Then, click “Analyze.”\n\nIn the “Demographics” tab, you can pull data about age, gender, and country.\n\nIn the “Socioeconomics” tab, you’ll see household size and employment status. Plus education and income level.\n\nThese insights can guide your product, pricing, and marketing strategy. \n\nFor example, if a large part of your audience is in a low-income bracket, then you’re most likely operating in a price-driven market. That means buying decisions are likely to be influenced most by the price of the product. \n\nIn such markets, you may want to focus your messaging around value for money. And drive sales volume with discounts, offers, and promotions. \n\nStep 4. Fill In the Matrix\n\nNow that you’ve collected your data, simply add it to your comparison matrix. In this case, the competitive landscape chart.\n\nIt might look something like this:\n\nUse Your Findings to Gain a Competitive Advantage\n\nThe main goal of creating a competitive matrix is turning data into insights you can act on to drive growth.\n\nBut maintaining a long-term competitive advantage also requires an awareness of your competitors’ actions.\n\nUse Semrush’s EyeOn to automate tracking your competitors’ online marketing activities. \n\nIt keeps you updated on your competitors’ newly published pages, blog posts, Google ads, social media updates, and more. \n\nTrack Competitors’ Marketing Activities\n\nwith the EyeOn Tool\n\nStart Free Monitoring →",
