  "content": "Whether to use a subdomain vs. subdirectory model is a long-standing debate in the SEO community.\n\nIn this post, we’ll review these two options. And provide a verdict on which is better for SEO.\n\nLet’s start.\n\nWhat Is a Subdomain?\n\nA subdomain is an extended part of your domain name that’s built for a specific purpose. And acts as a separate site.\n\nFor example, you can create a subdomain like blog.yoursite.com to host your blog content.\n\nAnother reason why you might use a subdomain is to separate the ecommerce portion of your website from its main domain.\n\nBy introducing a subdomain like shop.yoursite.com.\n\nThis helps you to create a different look, feel, and functionality for your online store than your main website. \n\nYou’ll come across subdomains like these all over the internet. They’re incredibly common.\n\nTo see whether your site is using any subdomains, crawl your website with Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nFollow the Site Audit configuration guide to set up your project.\n\nThen, go to the “Crawled Pages” tab and click “Site Structure.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of subdomains on your site.\n\nBut does having subdomains harm your SEO?\n\nLet’s find out.\n\nCheck What Subdomains You’re Using\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nThe Traditional View on How Subdomains Affect SEO\n\nMany SEOs argue that content hosted on subdomains doesn’t rank well on Google.\n\nHere’s their reasoning:\n\nSubdomains may not fully benefit from the backlinks (links from other sites that point to yours) the main domain has garnered over the years.\n\nGoogle treats subdomains as distinct websites. Which means they crawl and index subdomains separately.\n\nAs a result, you may have to work on gaining backlinks for each subdomain separately to improve their rankings. Which requires a lot of time and effort.\n\nWithout that added effort, content on those subdomains may not rank as well as it could’ve if it were hosted on subdirectories instead. (You’ll hear more on subdirectories later in this guide.)\n\nAlso, the more subdomains you have, the harder it can be to maintain your website overall.\n\nYou may end up with duplicate content (content that’s identical to content found elsewhere) and/or improper interlinking (links to other pages on the same website) between the main domain and its subdomains.\n\nThese errors can hurt your website rankings and the user experience.\n\nPlus, collecting and analyzing data for SEO reports can be more difficult when you’re dealing with multiple subdomains. Because it may require additional tools or settings to merge data effectively.\n\nFor all these reasons, SEOs usually recommend using subdirectories instead of subdomains.\n\nWhat Is a Subdirectory?\n\nA subdirectory (also called a subfolder) is a folder located within the main domain. It clearly falls under your domain name.\n\nSimilar to subdomains, subdirectories help you organize your website content into different categories or sections.\n\nFor example, you can create a subdirectory like yoursite.com/blog to host your blog content.\n\nIf you’ve crawled your website with the Site Audit tool, you can find all subdirectories you’re using.\n\nJust navigate to the “Crawled Pages” tab and click on “Site Structure.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of subdirectories on your site.\n\nBut what difference do subdirectories make to SEO?\n\nLet’s find out.\n\nCheck What Subdirectories You’re Using\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nThe Traditional View on How Subdirectories Affect SEO\n\nMany SEOs believe that subdirectories are more SEO-friendly compared to subdomains.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nWhile Google often views subdomains as separate entities, subdirectories are seen as part of the main domain.\n\nThis means that all the hard work you put into building backlinks is more likely to benefit every piece of content under that main domain, including those in subdirectories.\n\nThat’s because the link equity usually gets distributed throughout the domain.\n\nAnother upside of using subdirectories is that they allow for simplified management.\n\nBecause everything sits tidily under one domain umbrella, there are fewer technical headaches.\n\nFor example, you wouldn’t have to worry about setting up and maintaining separate hosting.\n\nAnd you can easily create new subdirectories for different sections of your website, such as your blog, your news section, etc.\n\nDoing this on subdomains would require more effort and resources.\n\nBetter yet, tracking website data is more straightforward with subdirectories. Because you can easily get a holistic view of your site’s performance in one place.\n\nThese benefits are why SEOs often insist on using subdirectories.\n\nExploring the Subdomain vs. Subdirectory Debate\n\nThe topic of subdomain vs. subdirectory is hotly debated in the search community.\n\nWe’ve heard the SEOs’ side of the argument.\n\nTo recap:\n\nOne major reason why they dislike subdomains is because they believe Google views subdomains as separate entities—not as part of the same website. So, the content hosted on them might not benefit from the main domain’s accumulated domain authority.\n\nBut what does Google think of this?\n\nGoogle’s John Muller once said that it’s fine to use either subdomains or subdirectories.\n\nGoogle web search is fine with using either subdomains or subdirectories.\n \n\n- John Mueller, Google\n\nSuggesting it doesn’t make any difference from a ranking standpoint. Positively or negatively.\n\nKeep in mind that Google has evolved its understanding of domain structures over the years. \n\nThis means that while they may treat subdomains as separate entities, they can still identify and acknowledge the relationship between the main domain and its subdomains.\n\nAnd with proper internal linking, you can make it clear that your subdomains belong to the same website.\n\nInternal linking facilitates bots’ abilities to crawl all the pages on your site (including those on subdomains). And helps distribute link equity among them.\n\nWhich puts an end to the myth that subdomains are bad for SEO.\n\nAs long as you use them correctly, subdomains are fine for your SEO performance.\n\nShould You Use a Subdomain or a Subdirectory?\n\nFrom an SEO perspective, it’s OK to use either option. They’re equally good for SEO, according to Google.\n\nBut there are other reasons to choose a subdomain over a subdirectory. And vice-versa.\n\nWhen You Should Use a Subdomain\n\nUsing a subdomain can be beneficial in several scenarios.\n\nHere’re some situations when implementing a subdomain might be the right choice:\n\n1. You Company Operates Internationally\n\nIf your business operates in multiple countries and you want to offer content tailored to each location, subdomains can be a great solution.\n\nFor example, we use subdomains like es.semrush.com and fr.semrush.com to cater to different regions.\n\nThis way, we offer a more relevant and personalized experience to our global audience.\n\nNote\n\nYou can also implement internationalization with subdirectories. But using subdomains better allows you to use localized hosting. Which can improve your page load times.\n\n2. You Need to Do Testing\n\nSubdomains are often used for staging environments. To test new features, updates, or designs before rolling them out to the main site.\n\nFor this, developers might create a subdomain like dev.example.com or staging.example.com.\n\nThis will help them spot and fix any issues before going live. And ensure that users have a seamless experience.\n\n3. You Want to Implement Distinct Design and Functionality\n\nIf a part of your website requires a very different design and functionality from your main site, a subdomain can provide the necessary distinction.\n\nFor example, you might use a subdomain to distinguish the ecommerce part of your website from the main domain.\n\nA subdomain would look something like shop.example.com, while the main domain would be example.com.\n\nGoogle does this for their own online shop:\n\nThis way, you can introduce a new design and functionality for your ecommerce store without affecting the site.\n\nWhen You Should Use a Subdirectory\n\nHere’s when implementing a subdirectory might be more beneficial:\n\n1. You Need Something Easy to Manage\n\nIf you want to simplify website setup and maintenance, subdirectories are a good option. \n\nSubdirectories don’t require additional technical configurations the way subdomains do.\n\nYou don’t need to set up a new hosting account, SSL certificate, or analytics tracking for the subdirectory.\n\nPlus, you can easily create and edit subdirectories within your main website’s content management system (CMS).\n\nThis streamlined approach not only makes the initial setup quicker and more straightforward, but also reduces the ongoing administrative work.\n\n2. You’re Prioritizing Consistent Branding\n\nSubdirectories can help you maintain a consistent branding and user experience across your website.\n\nSubdirectories share the same design elements as your main website. Which can create a unified and coherent impression for your visitors.\n\nWhich is what the American Lung Association has done:\n\nBut subdomains can create confusion. Because they may have different design elements than your main website.\n\nThis inconsistency can lead visitors to second-guess the subdomain’s authenticity.\n\nOptimize Your Subdomains & Subdirectories for SEO\n\nThe choice between subdomains and subdirectories largely depends on reasons outside of SEO.\n\nBoth can be SEO-friendly.\n\nWhether you decide to use subdomains or subdirectories, you need to optimize them for the best chance of ranking in search engines.\n\nThis means targeting the right keywords, doing on-page SEO, building backlinks, and avoiding technical SEO issues.\n\nSemrush has a suite of SEO tools that help with all of the above and more.\n\nSign up today to get started.\n\nAccess All the SEO Tools You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
