  "content": "What Is On-Page SEO?\n\nOn-page SEO (also called on-site SEO) is the process of optimizing webpages and their content for both search engines and users. It can help rank pages higher on Google and drive more organic traffic. \n\nCommon tasks associated with on-page SEO include optimizing for search intent, title tags, internal links, and URLs.\n\nBelow, we’ll cover different techniques for optimizing your site for on-page concerns.\n\nBut first, let’s explore the difference between on-page SEO and off-page SEO:\n\nOn-Page SEO vs. Off-Page SEO\n\nOn-page SEO covers anything you can do on a webpage (or internally) to improve your rankings. \n\nOff-page SEO covers anything you can optimize outside of your site (or externally) in an attempt to boost your rankings. Backlinks are arguably the biggest off-page SEO factor. Other examples include social media and PR.\n\nBoth are important components of any good SEO strategy.\n\nBut you have more control over on-page SEO factors. So focusing on those is a good place to start.\n\nWhy Is On-Page SEO Important?\n\nSearch engines use keywords and other on-page SEO elements to check whether a page matches a user’s search intent. \n\nAnd if the page is relevant and useful, Google serves it to the user.\n\nIn other words:\n\nGoogle pays attention to on-page SEO signals when ranking pages.\n\nThe Google algorithm is always changing, but Google continues to prioritize user experience. Google recommends focusing on “people-first content.” \n\nMeaning creating valuable content that matches user intent is more important than ever.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at how you can update your content to reflect on-page SEO best practices.\n\nPro tip\n\nTo quickly get actionable on-page SEO optimization ideas for your site, run it through On Page SEO Checker.\n\n9 On-Page SEO Techniques for Your Website\n\nHere are some key on-page optimization techniques you should consider:\n\nWrite unique, helpful content \nPlace target keywords strategically\nWrite keyword-rich title tags\nWrite click-worthy meta descriptions\nUse headings and subheadings to structure your page\nOptimize URLs\nAdd internal links\nAdd external links \nInclude and optimize images \n\nLet’s look at these in more detail.\n\nTip\n\nCreate a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along with the techniques in this guide. \n\n1. Write Unique, Helpful Content \n\nOne of the most important on site SEO steps you should take is to create high-quality content that matches your readers’ search intent.\n\nStart by performing keyword research to find relevant topics and target keywords.\n\nFor this example, we’ll use the Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter the topic you want to research and click “Search.” We’ll use the keyword “audio book” as our example. \n\nYou’ll get a list of keywords related to your seed keyword, sorted by search volume.\n\nHigh search volume can be useful to target. \n\nBut pay attention to the keyword difficulty (KD %) level, too. It’s much more difficult to rank for more competitive keywords (which have higher KD % scores).\n\nTarget less competitive long-tail keywords, too. \n\nThey often have lower search volume but lower keyword difficulty. Which means they can be easier to rank for.\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool automatically sorts related keywords into relevant categories.\n\nThey’re located in the left-hand sidebar. You can narrow your research by selecting one.\n\nHere:\n\nOnce you’ve selected your keywords, it’s time to create your content.\n\nRead our guide to formatting a blog post when you’re ready to get started.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few best practices to create optimized, high-quality content:\n\nIncorporate keywords naturally into your content (and avoid keyword stuffing)\nMake sure your content matches the search intent of your target keyword\nFully answer the query—your content should be useful to users\nWrite unique content that offers something competitors don’t\nInclude visual content (more on that later)\n\nFurther reading: What Is Quality Content & How to Create It\n\n2. Place Target Keywords Strategically\n\nSo you have your target keywords. Now it’s time to strategically place them in your content. \n\nGoogle scans your content to see what a page is about—and readers will likely do the same.\n\nSo you should include your target keywords in these key areas:\n\nH1\nFirst paragraph\nSubheaders (H2s, H3s, etc.)\n\nThis will help Google gain context about the topic of your page. And users will be able to quickly tell whether the page matches their search intent.\n\nYou can begin analyzing your content with On Page SEO Checker. \n\nStart by configuring the tool for your site.\n\nOnce you complete the setup, you’ll see a page that looks like this:\n\nYou can click on a specific page from the recommended “TOP pages to optimize” list, or review the “Optimization Ideas” tab for a complete overview.\n\nClick on the “# ideas” blue button to see recommendations.\n\nThe content section will let you know whether you’ve used your target keywords in key places like the H1 and body of the of the page (and whether keyword stuffing is detected):\n\nIf the tool does detect issues, it will provide recommendations.\n\nLike this:\n\nIt also provides helpful information about related keywords you can add to your text to further optimize it.\n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Write Keyword-Rich Title Tags\n\nTitle tags are pieces of HTML code that indicate what the title of a page is. And display that title in search engines, social media posts, and browser tabs.\n\nAdditionally,they can influence whether a user decides to click on your page.\n\nThey can look like this on the SERP (search engine results page):\n\nHere are a few tips to follow when writing your title tags:\n\nKeep it brief. We recommend keeping title tags between 50 and 60 characters so Google doesn’t cut them off\nInclude your target keyword. This helps both Google and users determine what your page is about.\nBe unique. Avoid duplicate title tags so that each individual page’s purpose is clear to Google (and users know what they’re clicking on).\n\nOn Page SEO Checker will also provide tips to help you write better title tags. Plus information about what, how, and why to do it. \n\nFurther reading: What Is a Title Tag & How to Optimize Title Tags for Google\n\n4. Write Click-Worthy Meta Descriptions\n\nA meta description tag is an HTML element on a site that provides a brief summary of the page. And search engines like Google may use it to generate a snippet (the descriptive text part of a search result). \n\nIt usually shows up on the SERP below your page’s title. Like this:\n\nMeta descriptions don’t directly influence Google rankings. \n\nBut, like title tags, they can be a deciding factor between a user clicking on your page or another one. Which means they can encourage more search traffic.\n\nAnd if your meta description doesn’t match the user’s search intent (or the content on the page), Google may choose its own description for the SERP. \n\nSo it’s best to follow these best practices to increase your chances of Google using your chosen meta description:\n\nConsider mobile devices. Google truncates meta descriptions after about 120 characters on mobile. So it’s best to keep them on the shorter side.\nInclude your target keyword. This helps users determine if their page matches their search intent. Google also bolds keywords (and synonyms of keywords) that match the user’s search query. Which stands out visually and could boost clicks.\nUse active voice. Active voice saves space and communicates your message more clearly.\nAdd a CTA(call to action). Entice users to click with CTA phrases (like “try for free,” or “find out more”).\n\nYou can also find tips for writing better meta descriptions in On Page SEO Checker.\n\nFurther reading: What Is a Meta Description? [+ SEO & Writing Tips]\n\n5. Use Headings and Subheadings to Structure Your Page\n\nH1 tags and subsequent headings allow users to easily skim your page. And help Google understand the hierarchy of your page.\n\nLook at the following image. And see how difficult it is to read a page without organized headings (compared to one that has them).\n\nThe right is an example of on-page SEO done right. It’s easy to skim and find specific information.\n\nHeadings also help Google better understand your page’s structure and determine whether your page matches a user’s search intent. Which can help you rank higher for relevant keywords.\n\nYou can use keywords and keyword variations in headings to give Google more context about the structure of your page and what information you cover.\n\nUse the H1 as your page title or headline. And include H2s to cover subtopics. \n\nIf you need to cover content in further detail, use H3s, H4s, etc.\n\nOn Page SEO Checker will also provide ideas to help you optimize your headings.\n\nOptimize Your Headings for Better Rankings\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\n6. Optimize URLs\n\nGoogle recommends using simple URLS that don’t look “cryptic” or intimidating. In other words:\n\nUse words that are relevant to your content so users can tell what your page is about.\n\nAnd not random numbers, publish dates, or full sentences. Website themes will often use these by default, so it’s important to update your URL before publishing.\n\nUsing your target keyword in your URL is a good way to ensure your URL matches the topic of your content.\n\nAn “unfriendly” URL might look something like this:\n\nAnd this is how you could update it to be more useful and easy to understand:\n\nThe more context Google has about a particular page, the better it can understand it. And if Google understands what a page is about, it’s able to match it with relevant search queries.\n\nFurther reading: What Is a URL? Meaning, Structure, and Optimization Tips\n\n7. Strategically Add Internal Links\n\nInternal links are hyperlinks that point to different pages on the same site. Here’s what an internal link looks like on a webpage:\n\nInternal links are an important part of on-page SEO optimization. Here’s why:\n\nThey help search engines understand your site’s structure and how pages are related to each other\nThey allow Google crawlers to discover and navigate to new pages\nThey signal to Google that the linked-to page is valuable\nThey help users navigate through your website (and keep them on your site longer)\n\nFurther reading: Internal Links: Ultimate Guide + Strategies\n\n8. Add External Links to Authoritative Sources\n\nExternal links are links on your site that point to other sites. They’re important because they enhance user experience and build trust with your audience.\n\nGoogle has said that adding links to authoritative external sources is a great way to provide value to your users. \n\nAnd providing solid user experience is always a good thing.\n\nHere are a few best practices for you to follow:\n\nOnly link to authoritative and trustworthy sites related to the topic and niche\nUse descriptive and natural anchor text to show readers what to expect when they click\nBalance the number and placement of external links to avoid looking spammy\n\nYou can quickly check your site for external link issues with Site Audit. Just head to the “Issues” tab and type “external” in the search bar.\n\nFurther reading: What Is an External Link? + SEO Best Practices\n\n9. Include and Optimize Images \n\nIncluding images in your content increases your chances of ranking in Google Images. This is a great way to get more traffic to your site.\n\nA good place to start optimizing your images is by writing descriptive alt text for them.\n\nAlt text (short for alternative text) is text included in HTML code that describes an image on a webpage.\n\nIt has two main purposes:\n\nIt provides context for search engine crawlers\nIt allows people using screen readers to hear descriptions of images\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nHere are some tips for writing good alt text:\n\nKeep it brief. Screen readers stop reading alt text after about 125 characters.\nInclude a target keyword. Include your target keyword for context (but don’t spam keywords for the sake of it).\nDon’t add alt text to decorative images. Graphics like horizontal page breaks, a magnifying glass in a search bar, etc., don’t require further explanation.\nDon’t include “image of” or “picture of.” Alt text implies that it’s describing an image, so there’s no need to waste characters on these phrases.\n\nTo find missing image alt text on your site, head to the “Issues” report in Site Audit. \n\nAnd search for “alt attributes” in the search bar if you have multiple errors to comb through.\n\nAside from adding optimized alt text, here are a few of ways to optimize images:\n\nWrite descriptive file names to help search engines understand what your image is about\nUse free tools like ImageOptim to compress images for faster load times\nUse lazy loading, which tells web browsers to wait to load images until the user scrolls to them\n\nFurther reading: Image SEO and Alt Tags: 10 Image Optimization Tips\n\nAdvanced On-Page SEO Tactics\n\nOnce you’ve got the on site SEO basics down, you can try out some more advanced SEO page optimization techniques. \n\nLet’s start with an important on-page SEO factor—page speed.\n\nOptimize for Page Speed\n\nWe may never know every Google ranking factor. But we do know that page speed is a confirmed ranking factor.\n\nSo it’s more important than ever to optimize for page speed.\n\nYou can use Google’s free PageSpeed Insights tool to get an overall performance score for both mobile and desktop, in addition to actionable suggestions for improvement.\n\nThis tool assesses Google’s Core Web Vitals, which are factors that impact page experience. \n\nThe Core Web Vitals are:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP): amount of time it takes for the main piece of content to load\nFirst Input Delay (FID): amount of time it takes for your website to respond to the first interaction from a user (like a click on a link)\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS): amount your webpage shifts (or “moves down”) as more content (e.g., banners, images) loads\n\nTo get started, enter your URL and click the “Analyze” button:\n\nHere’s what the report looks like:\n\nAnd here’s the full list of errors that might slow your site down:\n\nThere’s also an “Opportunities” report that gives suggestions for improvement:\n\nFor more in-depth information on technical errors, you can use Site Audit.\n\nFind “Core Web Vitals” under “Thematic Reports.” Click “View details.”\n\nYou’ll see the overall status of your SEO pages’ performance over time. \n\nIn this report, you’ll also see technical details like we talked about earlier. Such as LCP and CLS. \n\nThe Core Web Vitals report includes Total Blocking Time (TBT) to closely estimate FID.\n\nUnder each column, you’ll find top recommended improvements and the pages affected.\n\nClick on each underlined suggestion to read more about the issue and how to fix it.\n\nRun this report at least once a month to keep up with any errors. You can also send automated reports to yourself or clients in the “My Reports” management tab in Semrush.\n\nTarget Featured Snippets\n\nBecause featured snippets appear in “position zero” above other organic results, they can help boost your click-through rate (CTR).\n\nThere are different forms of featured snippets, including:\n\nDefinitions\nTables\nLists\nVideos\n\nTo check if a keyword has a current featured snippet, go to Keyword Overview. We’ll use the example “can dogs eat watermelon.”\n\nEnter your keyword and click “Search.” \n\nYou’ll see information about search volume, keyword difficulty, and more.\n\nScroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section of the page. \n\nTo the right of this graph, you’ll see a link that says “View SERP.” Click it to view what the SERP looks like for that keyword when it’s not influenced by location, user behavior, etc.\n\nNow we can see that “can dogs eat watermelon” does indeed have a featured snippet. And which pages are ranking underneath that.\n\nIf you want to take the top spot, update (or create) your own page following on-page SEO best practices.\n\nSome ways to target a featured snippet include:\n\nAnswering the query in a concise, user-friendly way\nUnderstanding (and catering directly to) the user’s search intent\nFormatting the answer accordingly—could be a quick one- or two-sentence answer, a table, a video, etc.\nAdd Schema Markup\n\nSchema markup allows search engines to better understand information on your website. \n\nIt adds code to a page that better communicates the page topic. So you can convey to search engines that your page is about an event, contains a recipe, etc. And the SERP result can reflect that.\n\nUsing schema can provide rich snippets in the SERP. They look like this:\n\nIn addition to taking up more valuable space on the SERP, schema markup also can improve your page’s organic CTR.\n\nThe above example uses recipe schema markup. But you can add many different types to your pages. \n\nCommon types of schema include:\n\nReviews\nProducts\nEvents\nPeople\nLocal businesses\n\nAnd more.\n\nYou can find information on every type at Schema.org.\n\nLet’s look at an example of schema markup in action. Say you type “new york events near me” into Google.\n\nThe top of the SERP looks something like this:\n\nTo better your chances of showing up above the normal search results like this, you can use “Event” schema markup.\n\nWhich communicates the event date, address, and location to Google.\n\nGoogle may then feature these events above other results because they’re more useful.\n\nHere’s Google’s resource on adding Event structured data. And here’s what the Event schema might look like in your page’s code:\n\nYou can use Site Audit to check if you’ve implemented structured data correctly.\n\nYou’ll see a report labeled “Markup” under “Thematic Reports.”\n\nClick the “View details” button.\n\nSite Audit will score any pages that have schema markup, break down pages by schema type, and alert you of any existing issues.\n\nIf Site Audit does flag any issues with your markup, we recommend running those individual pages through Schema.org’s markup validator. It’ll let you know if you’ve implemented the markup properly.\n\nFurther reading: What Is Schema Markup & How to Implement Structured Data\n\nImplement Proven On-Page SEO Techniques\n\nNow that you know what on-page SEO is, it’s time for you to take action. \n\nExecute on the techniques mentioned earlier, and you’ll be on your way to better rankings and traffic. \n\nStart by signing up for a free Semrush account (no credit card needed). \n\nYou’ll get access to On Page SEO Checker. But you’ll also be able to:\n\nDo keyword research\nAnalyze your competitors \nTrack your keyword rankings\nRun a site audit\n\nAnd more. \n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
