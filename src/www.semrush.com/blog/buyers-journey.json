  "content": "What Is the Buyer’s Journey?\n\nThe buyer’s journey (or purchase journey) is the process a customer typically goes through before making a purchase. From the moment they identify a desire or need to when they decide to buy.\n\nUnderstanding the buying journey helps you choose the best marketing tactics and communicate with your audience more effectively. And that should ultimately lead to more sales.\n\nThe process is typically broken down into three stages.\n\nWhat Are the Buyer Journey Stages?\n\nThe three stages of the buyer’s journey are awareness, consideration, and decision.\n\nThe consumer becomes aware of a problem, considers the solution(s) available, then decides where to buy.\n\nLet’s say you sell kitchen appliances: \n\nSomeone’s dishwasher breaks and they want a replacement (awareness)\nThey read online comparison guides about the best models (consideration)\nThey decide to buy from you because you offer free delivery (decision)\n\nIn reality, your customers’ buying journeys are unique. And they can be far more complex than this model suggests.\n\nBut the awareness > consideration > decision framework makes it easier to understand prospects’ thoughts and behaviors at the most important stages. So you can work out how to engage them earlier in their decision-making process. And increase the chance that they ultimately buy from you.\n\nNote\n\nThe three stages of the buyer’s journey correspond with the top, middle, and bottom of the marketing funnel (ToFu/MoFu/BoFu). This model helps you understand audience behavior on the whole, rather than a specific buyer’s perspective.\n \n\nHow to Do Buyer Journey Mapping\n\nBuyer journey mapping is the process of defining and visualizing the awareness, consideration, and decision stages.\n\nThe idea is to create representatives of valuable buyer journeys. So you can work out how to engage prospects at each crucial phase.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\n1. Create Buyer Personas\n\nBuyer personas are fictional profiles that represent different types of prospects. They help you understand the audience segments you’re targeting.\n\nPersonas typically cover:\n\nDemographics\nSocioeconomic status\nPersonality and habits\nPain points\nContent preferences\n\nHere’s an example created with Semrush’s Persona tool:\n\nTo create effective buyer personas, you need to conduct audience research.\n\nFirst, analyze your competitors’ audiences with Semrush’s One2Target tool.\n\nChoose your target country, enter the domains of up to five competitors, then click “Analyze.”\n\nThe tool will gather insights about these rivals’ audiences. \n\nHere are the charts you’ll find in each report:\n\nDemographics: Age, gender, and location\nSocioeconomics: Household size, household income level, employment status, and education level\nBehavior: Most visited social media platforms, top interests (based on visited domains), and most-used devices\n\nYou can analyze your own website visitors in Google Analytics 4 (GA4).\n\nAfter signing in, go to “Reports” > “User” > “User attributes” > “Overview.”\n\nGA4 collects the following data about web users by default:\n\nDemographics: Age, gender, interests, language, \nLocation: City, country, region, continent, subcontinent\nTechnology: Browser, operating system and version, platform, device brand, device category\n\nTo get additional data, you need to configure your own user-scoped dimensions.\n\nYou can then use the “Audiences” report to see how predefined or custom segments (e.g., users in San Francisco) interact with your site differently.\n\nThe data you gather will help build realistic buyer personas for existing and prospective audiences. So you can get into their mindsets more easily.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Audiences\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\n2. Analyze Users’ Traffic Journeys\n\nTraffic journeys are routes users take through various webpages or websites.\n\nWhen you know what websites and channels are involved in the buyer’s journey, you can try to engage your prospects through them more effectively.\n\nFor example, a prospect with a broken dishwasher might take this journey:\n\ngoogle.com, to search for information about the latest models\nconsumerreports.org, to see their dishwasher ratings\ngoogle.com, to search for their chosen model\nbestbuy.com, to see the price of their chosen model\nlowes.com, to see the price of their chosen model\nbestbuy.com, to buy their chosen model\n\nKnowing that, you might decide to:\n\nUse search engine optimization (SEO) and/or paid search ads to get more exposure in search engine results pages\nRun digital ads on popular sites in your niche\nForm partnerships with influencers\nList your business on directories, review sites, etc.\nPost social media content and ads\n\nBy reaching prospects earlier and more frequently, you increase the chance they ultimately buy from you.\n\nYou can see what sites and channels your current visitors come from by going to “Life cycle” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition” in GA4.\n\nTip\n\nGoogle can identify some traffic sources (e.g., google.com, facebook.com) automatically. For more precise tracking, use UTM parameters on links placed outside your site.\n\nTo find out where your competitors’ visitors come from, use the Traffic Analytics tool.\n\nAfter entering the domain(s) you’re interested in, open the “Traffic Journey” report.\n\nThen, scroll down to “Traffic Journey Details.”\n\nBelow, we can see that organic (unpaid) Google results drive 27.99% of competitors’ traffic. This indicates that organic search plays a major role in awareness and consideration stages.\n\nIf you go to the “Destinations” tab, you’ll see where users go after visiting your competitors.\n\nThis can provide valuable insight into the consideration and decision stages.\n\nIn our example, many users go to coupon sites like capitaloneshopping.com after visiting a competitor. This suggests that discounts play a major role in the decision stage.\n\nOur dishwasher retailer might therefore decide to offer exclusive discounts. Or partner with coupon sites.\n\nTip\n\nYou can access Traffic Analytics, One2Target, and other helpful tools with a Semrush .Trends subscription.\n\n3. Perform Keyword Research for Every Stage\n\nKeyword research is the process of identifying search engine queries that prospects use. So you can work out how to appear in the results for them.\n\nHere’s a keyword example for each buyer journey stage:\n\nAwareness: dishwasher not draining\nConsideration: best dishwasher 2024\nDecision: frigidaire dishwasher\n\nMany marketers rightfully focus on buyer keywords (search queries that people use when they’re ready to purchase). Because they’re keen to generate sales.\n\nBut it’s important to target keywords used in the earlier stages, too. Not only will this maximize your brand’s reach, but it will help you build trust that can pay dividends later.\n\nOne of the best ways to find keywords is with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a term to base your search around (e.g., “dishwasher”), choose your target country, and click “Search.”\n\nBy default, the tool presents a list of “Broad Match” keywords that contain your starting keyword or a close variation.\n\nIn the “Intent” column, you can see the type(s) of search intent behind each keyword—i.e., the general purpose behind the user’s search. This gives a good indication of what buyer journey stage the keyword corresponds to.\n\nIntent Type\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nBuyer Journey Stage\n\n\t\n\nKeyword Example\n\n\n\n\nInformational (I)\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to find information\n\n\t\n\nAwareness\n\n\t\n\ndishwasher not draining\n\n\n\n\nCommercial (C)\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to research a brand, product, or service\n\n\t\n\nConsideration\n\n\t\n\nbest dishwasher 2024\n\n\n\n\nNavigational (N)\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to find a specific page or website\n\n\t\n\nDecision\n\n\t\n\nbest buy dishwashers\n\n\n\n\nTransactional (T)\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to take action (e.g., buy something)\n\n\t\n\nDecision\n\n\t\n\nfrigidaire dishwasher\n\nYou can easily filter by intent. And other data points, such as:\n\nVolume: The average number of monthly searches for the keyword\nKD %: The keyword difficulty score, which measures organic ranking difficulty out of 100\nCPC (USD): The estimated cost per click to advertise on this keyword\n\nOnce you’ve identified the keywords you want to target, you can create SEO-friendly content and/or paid search ads.\n\n4. Fill Out the Buyer’s Journey Template\n\nUse our free buyer’s journey template to record key information about your buyer journeys.\n\nFollow the link then click “Use Template” to create your copy in Google Docs. (You might need to sign into Google first.)\n\nThen, follow the advice in this guide to fill out each section.\n\nYou should end up with a few buyer journey maps that look something like this:\n\nBuying Journey Content: Tips & Examples\n\nLet’s explore some content marketing tips and examples for the three buyer stages:\n\nAwareness Stage\n\nAwareness stage content should help prospects to recognize and understand their pain point. \n\nThat way, you can build trust with the prospect. And start guiding them toward purchase.\n\nFor example, appliance brand Whirlpool has a blog post about how long dishwashers run for. It gets around 7.3K unpaid visits from Google each month, according to Semrush’s Organic Research tool. \n\nThe post attracts people who are concerned about their appliance’s performance. And gives them useful advice and information—with no hard sell.\n\nAs a result, prospective customers are gently guided toward the next phase of the buying journey. Having built familiarity and trust with the Whirlpool brand.\n\nGenerally, the best types of content for the awareness stage are:\n\nTroubleshooting guides/videos\nHow-to guides\nChecklists\nThought leadership\nIndustry/company news articles\nOriginal research\nTemplates\nConsideration Stage\n\nConsideration stage content should help prospects weigh the solutions available to them. And present your product or service as one of the best options.\n\nFor example, Whirlpool has a dishwasher measurement guide that equips shoppers with all the information they need to find the right-sized model. \n\nIt also introduces them to relevant products.\n\nGenerally, the best types of content for the consideration stage are:\n\nComparison guides\nBuying guides\nFAQs\nProduct buying quizzes\nGift guides\nDecision Stage\n\nDecision stage content should convince customers to get their chosen product or service from you (rather than a competitor).\n\nFor example, Best Buy’s product pages immediately draw attention to special offers, financing options, pickup/delivery information, and customer reviews. Which can all play a pivotal role in customers’ buying decisions.\n\nShoppers can also read various questions and answers. Or speak to a customer service advisor.\n\nThis reduces the risk that they abandon their purchase due to a lack of information. \n\nGenerally, the best types of content for the consideration stage are:\n\nLanding pages/product pages\nFree trials or demos\nCustomer reviews/testimonials\nCase studies/success stories\n\nNote\n\nThe buyer’s journey is a subset of the customer journey, which also includes post-purchase stages such as loyalty and advocacy.\n\nStart Mapping Your Buyer Journeys\n\nIf you haven’t already, create your buyer journey template.\n\nThen, claim your free Semrush trial to start collecting valuable data:\n\nDefine your audience’s demographics, socioeconomics, and behaviors\nResearch your prospects’ traffic journeys\nFind out what keywords your prospects use\nAnalyze your competitors’ content\n\nResearch the Buying Journey\n\nwith Semrush’s Toolkit\n\nStart Free Trial →",
