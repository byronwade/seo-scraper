  "content": "We’ve put together a list of our favorite writing tools for marketers. \n\nFrom crafting copy to creating blog posts, these tools can help you with all aspects of writing. Research, organization, SEO, editing—you name it.\n\nWriting Tools\n\nThese online writing tools help you with the physical writing of your text. They can analyze and optimize existing writing. And some can compose text for you using AI.\n\n(AI tools have been known to generate misinformation. So make sure you do your research and fact-check any claims AI generates.)\n\n1. SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSemrush’s SEO Writing Assistant is a handy writing tool that helps you create quality, SEO-friendly text.\n\nIt analyzes your writing and suggests improvements in real-time. This includes tips on readability, tone of voice, and keyword placement.\n\nThe tool can also compose text snippets for you thanks to the AI Smart Writer functionality. Plus, the handy Rephraser tool lets you rephrase, summarize, or expand sections of text.\n\nGoogle Docs and MS Word add-ons let you analyze and improve your text wherever you like to write. So you can seamlessly improve your writing and boost your SEO without needing to load any extra software.\n\nPricing\n\nSemrush’s SEO Writing Assistant comes with Guru and Business plans, with prices starting at $208.33 per month (billed annually).\n\nThese plans give you access to a huge suite of SEO tools, including Position Tracking, Keyword Strategy Builder, and the Link Building Tool.

ContentShake\n\nContentShake AI is Semrush’s all-in-one content writing tool. You can generate ideas, draft content, and publish it from the app in a few easy steps.\n\nFirst, enter your topic. ContentShake uses competitive market data to generate relevant content ideas with high search volumes.\n\nThen, write the text yourself or use the AI feature to compose the text. You get scores for readability, tone of voice, and more on the right-hand side. These update as you write.\n\nYou can also ask the tool to optimize sections of text. For example, by expanding or simplifying the text.\n\nWhen your content is ready, publish it directly to WordPress using the ContentShake AI plugin. Or share it through the app or Google Docs.\n\nContentShake makes the content creation process seamless. You can do everything in one place. Making it quicker and easier to create quality, optimized content.\n\nPricing\n\nThere’s a free version of ContentShake. That gives you access to all the basic features.

So you can quickly create unique images to go with your blog and social posts.\n\nAI Writing Assistant is designed with marketers in mind. So it has a tool for every part of the content creation and writing process. \n\nPricing\n\nThe 7-day free trial of AI Writing Assistant gives you unlimited access to generate text or images. The paid version costs $25 per month and gives you unlimited credits.\n\n4. ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT is a generative AI tool that can be used for a range of purposes, including writing. For example, writers can use it to generate content ideas, create blog outlines, and rephrase content.\n\nYou can modify your prompts and ask ChatGPT to include certain information or use a certain tone of voice.\n\nFor example, you could ask it to write you a blog post introduction with a light-hearted, jokey tone-of-voice. Or using short sentences and plain English.\n\nThe handy thing about ChatGPT: It remembers your conversation history. So you can keep altering your prompts until you get it right.\n\nPricing\n\nThe basic version of ChatGPT is free. ChatGPT Plus costs $20 per month. It uses the more advanced GPT-4 dataset. You typically get faster response times and access to the latest features with the paid version.\n\n5. Perplexity.ai\n\nPerplexity is a generative AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT. But, crucially for writers, it provides sources for all the information it provides.\n\nThis allows you to quickly get summaries of topics, which you can use as the basis for your content. And click through to relevant articles to learn more.\n\nPerplexity also provides follow-up suggestions to help you delve further into a topic.\n\nAnd as a generative AI tool, Perlexity can write content for you. (Just remember to fact-check and edit.)\n\nWe find the best use of Perplexity to be for research. It makes it easy to explore a topic and bookmark key resources as you go.\n\nPricing\n\nPerplexity has a basic tool that’s free to use. There’s also a premium intelligent version called Copilot that is powered by GPT-4 or Claude 2—more advanced AI models. You have a limited number of free queries on Copilot. But for more intensive use, it’s $240 a year.\n\nEditing Tools\n\nNeed a little help with finishing touches like spelling and grammar? Check out these writers’ tools for editing:\n\n6. Grammarly\n\nGrammarly is a writing assistant that helps you with accuracy and style. It’s like an enhanced version of Microsoft Word’s spelling and grammar checker.\n\nGrammarly highlights words and phrases and suggests edits for spelling, grammar, and punctuation. It also offers improvements for clarity, so your writing is easier to read.\n\nGrammarly has recently launched an AI writing assistant called GrammarlyGO. This lets you quickly change the tone of your writing and make other edits like simplifying and shortening.\n\nWe like that Grammarly’s so easy and convenient to use. Once you’ve installed it, you get automatic prompts in MS Word, Google Docs, and web browsers. Plus, there’s a standalone app where you can paste and check your work.\n\nPricing\n\nThe free version of Grammarly provides basic writing suggestions and 100 AI prompts per month.\n\nPremium and Business plans offer more AI prompts and enhanced writing suggestions. Premium is for individuals and costs $12 per month, while Business plans start from $15 per month per user.\n\n7. Hemingway App\n\nHemingway App is an in-browser editing tool and desktop app. You copy and paste your text and it color-codes various opportunities for improvement, explaining how to improve each part.\n\nYou also receive a readability grade. It’s updated in real-time as you edit the text.\n\nWe find the color-coded highlighting in Hemingway App really speeds up the editing process. At a quick glance, you can see which sentences are too long, where you could use simpler phrasing, and more.\n\nPricing\n\nHemingway App is free to use. However, it’s not available on mobile and can’t be used in word processors.\n\n8. ProWritingAid\n\nProWritingAid is an advanced editing tool that’s available as a browser extension, desktop app, online web editor, and add-on for MS Office and Google Docs.\n\nIt was designed as a tool for authors but works for any type of writing.\n\nLike other editing tools, it color-codes sections with different ways to improve. It’s also started using AI for style improvements and rephrasing suggestions.\n\nWe like how seamless ProWritingAid is—you can use it wherever you’re writing and as you switch between different programs.\n\nPricing\n\nThere’s a free version of ProWritingAid where you get limited suggestions—a 500-word limit and 10 rephrases per day. Or the Premium version costs from $120 per year.\n\nResearch & Ideation Tools\n\nThere are also tools that help you generate ideas before you start writing. Here are our favorites:\n\n9. Topic Research\n\nSemrush’s Topic Research tool generates content ideas with an SEO focus. It works with you intuitively as you explore ideas for your content marketing and create content plans. \n\nTo find ideas:\n\nGo to the tool, enter a topic, and click “Get content ideas.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of cards showing one content area each.

This includes the top competing content pieces for each keyword. So you can see what’s already working well on Google.\n\nPlus, you get concrete recommendations for semantically linked keywords, word count, target readability score, and more. All based on competing content.\n\nYou can export your template, including all recommendations, by clicking “Export to DOC” at the top of the page.\n\nPricing\n\nSEO Content Template is part of Semrush’s Content Marketing Platform, which is included with Semrush Guru and Business plans. \n\nOrganization Tools\n\nOrganizational writing tools help you keep your writing on track.\n\nFrom to-do list tools to virtual scrapbooks, keep on top of everything with these tools:\n\n11. Todoist\n\nTodoist enhances your to-do lists for maximum productivity. Perfect for when you’re juggling writing, research, editing, emails, and more.\n\nCategorize your lists with various labels and filters—so you can make lists for different projects and clients.\n\nPlus, set recurring tasks and reminders. And assign tasks to other users. \n\nThis lets you focus on writing, safe in the knowledge that your to-do list is taken care of.\n\nWe like that, in Todoist, you can view your tasks in different formats like Kanban boards and calendar view. This flexibility lets you use the format that works best for your brain.\n\nPricing\n\nTodoist is free to start, and you can add up to five projects and five guests.\n\nBeyond that, the Pro plan is $4 per month. And you can have up to 300 projects, 25 guests, and unlimited filter views and activity history.\n\n12. Evernote\n\nIn the Evernote list app, in addition to creating classic checklists, you can easily add webpages, PDFs, and screengrabs to your lists. \n\nThis makes it easy to save helpful articles and resources for your writing and come back to them when needed.\n\nEvernote also lets you sync your notes and tasks with your calendar.

It lets you connect your Google Calendar, add due dates, set reminders, and more.\n\nThe Professional version costs $9.99 per month and lets you integrate to Slack, Salesforce, and more.\n\n13. Scrivener \n\nScrivener is an especially good long-form writing tool. It lets you write in sections and drag and drop them to rearrange.\n\nSo it’s great for getting out your first draft of an article. It helps you organize your ideas and create an effective structure.\n\nYou can also keep all your notes and research in Scrivener. So you have everything you need in one place.\n\nImage source: Literature & Latte\n\nWe like Scrivener’s intuitive and easy-to-use interface. It lets you easily switch between editing small chunks and the whole piece. Which means you can focus on small sections without getting overwhelmed or have an overview of the whole text.\n\nPricing\n\nScrivener software is free to download, but you need to buy a license to use it. A standard license costs $49. And it lasts forever.\n\nProductivity Tools\n\nIt’s not just tools for writing that help us writers. Productivity tools can help you manage your time, minimize distractions, and focus on writing. \n\nThese are our favorites.\n\n14. Freedom\n\nFreedom is primarily a website-blocking tool, but you can also block your access to the internet for defined periods.\n\nIt’s great for those times you need to completely focus on writing or meet a tight deadline.\n\nAnd you can sync Freedom across all your devices. So there’s no temptation from your computer, tablet, or phone.\n\nWe like how you can plan ahead by scheduling periods of blocked access in advance.\n\nAnd we find that the additional features like ambient music and session tracking—where you can see how much focussed time you’ve achieved—help further boost our productivity. \n\nPricing\n\nFreedom costs $3.33 per month if you pay annually, or $8.99 per month if you pay on a monthly basis. Or buy it forever for $199.\n\nIt also has a free trial that gives you seven blocking sessions at no charge.\n\n15.

Without having to open a different browser tab. \n\nPricing\n\nToggl is free for up to five users, though some features are locked.\n\nThe Starter plan for $10 per month has additional features like billable rates and project time estimates.\n\nThe Premium plan is $20 per month and is good for larger teams, with native Salesforce and Jira integrations.\n\n16.

So you can try it out, but you need to remember to cancel your subscription if you don’t want to continue.\n\n17. Trello\n\nYou can use Trello to organize your writing projects in Kanban format—using lists and cards.\n\nFor example, your content strategy board might have a list for each content pillar, with a card for each blog post.\n\nYou can assign cards to different people and archive them when they’re completed.\n\nYou could also use Trello for to-do lists, content ideas, and admin tasks. Or even integrate plugins for CRMs (e.g., Crmble) to manage writing clients.\n\nWe especially like how you can use Trello Power-Ups to add additional functionalities to boards. For example, you can integrate Trello with Gmail, Slack, and Teams to quickly create boards and cards from emails and messages.\n\nPricing\n\nTrello is free for individuals.\n\nSmall teams pay $5 per month per user.\n\nLarger teams pay $10 per month per user or a bespoke Enterprise price.\n\nTake Your Content to the Next Level with the Best Tools for Writers\n\nUsing data-driven writing tools helps you create content that shows up in search engines and attracts users to your site.
