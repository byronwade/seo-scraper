  "content": "What Are Search Terms? \n\nSearch terms are the exact words or phrases users enter into search engines when they‘re looking for information, products, or services online.\n\nThink of the last thing you Googled. That was a search term.\n\nA search term is anything you type into a search engine. Yes, anything. \n\nUnderstanding the Google search terms people use to find your website, products or services can improve your search engine marketing results.\n\nBecause it helps you optimize your website and ad campaigns for what people actually search for. \n\nWhat’s the Difference Between Search Terms and Keywords? \n\nSearch terms are what users type into search engines. Keywords are the terms businesses target and optimize their content for.\n\nOften, they’re the same. But not always. \n\nFor example, in pay-per-click advertising (PPC), keywords are the words or phrases Google Ads uses to match its ads with the terms people are searching for. \n\nSynonyms can trigger a match. Someone may type in the search term “best biodegradable cleaners for kitchens.” Which triggers an ad for “green cleaning products.” A keyword an advertiser has bid on.\n\nIn search engine optimization (SEO), keywords are researched terms selected to target relevant topics. With the goal of improving your ranking in the search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nSomeone may type in “pre owned camping equipment” and see the No. 1 result is a page titled “Used Camping Equipment.” The site has targeted this keyword in its content, and Google understands that it matches what the user is looking for. \n\nPeople type all kinds of common words and phrases into Google. They don’t necessarily know or care about using precise keywords. They just want their questions answered. \n\nYour keyword-targeted content works to do that. \n\nIn summary, search terms come from users. Keywords are identified and targeted by you.\n\nWhy Are Search Terms Important? \n\nSearch terms provide valuable information to businesses. They tell you exactly what a user is searching for.\n\nUse this knowledge to optimize your content and ad campaigns. So you can reach more customers. \n\nAnd scale your business.\n\nWhy Search Terms Are Important for PPC \n\nAnalyzing search terms helps you manage your PPC campaigns to maximize your return on investment (ROI).\n\nBecause you can use search term data to help you identify the most relevant and profitable keywords to target with your ad campaigns.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nTo run a Google Ad, set the keyword match type to dictate how closely a keyword needs to match the user’s search term.\n\nThere are three types:\n\nBroad match: Searches that use related keywords can trigger an ad. For example, an ad for the keyword “fitness equipment” showing when someone uses the search term “workout gear” because they’re conceptually similar. \nPhrase match: Ads can show when the search term includes the keyword’s meaning. Such as an ad for “running shoes” when the user searches “trendy running shoes.” \nExact match: An ad may show when the search term has the same meaning or search intent as the keyword. Like “men's gym shorts” and “gym shorts for men.” \n\nTo earn traffic that converts, balance reach with relevance. By deciding how closely search terms should match keywords.\n\nChoosing the right match type helps ensure your budget is spent efficiently on clicks that are more likely to convert.\n\nAnd that starts with analyzing search terms.\n\nTo further optimize your ad performance, leverage negative keywords to exclude ads from showing when users use certain search terms.\n\nFor example, if your photography business targets “wedding photographer” but gets clicks for “wedding videographer,” adding “videographer” as a negative keyword prevents showing ads for that irrelevant search term.\n\nThis helps prevent wasted ad spend. A key part of PPC strategy. \n\nWhy Search Terms Matter for SEO \n\nUnderstanding the search terms your target audience uses tells you how people find your website. And what they’re looking for. So you can ensure your content addresses their needs.\n\nFor example, you’re a florist in Miami with a product page for tulip floral arrangements.\n\nBut then you use Google Search Console to review the search terms people type into Google before they click on your product page. \n\n(More on how to do that later.)\n\nAnd there’s a problem. Hundreds of people type “tulip farm Holland, Michigan” before landing on your site.\n\nYou’re not running a tulip farm in Michigan. You’re selling tulip arrangements in Florida. \n\nIn reviewing your product page, a subhead near the top of the page details that your tulips are sourced from a “tulip farm in Holland, Michigan.”\n\nThat’s likely why your website appears in Google results when people enter that search term. The problem is that those people are looking for tulip farms in Michigan, not florists in Florida.\n\nYour page isn’t optimized for the right keyword. \n\nImproving on-page SEO includes elements like heading structure. You can still detail your tulips source on the page, but it’s no longer the focus of the content. \n\nInstead, you replace it with a subhead that includes the keyword “tulip floral arrangements,” which is your primary keyword for that page. \n\nNext time you check Google Search Console, you see that clicks from “tulip farm Holland, Michigan” have decreased. Which is OK. Those visitors weren’t looking for what you were selling. \n\nBut clicks from “tulip floral arrangements” have increased. Sending you qualified traffic and more potential customers. \n\nGoogle Analytics shows that conversions have increased, too.\n\nUnderstanding search terms means you can optimize for the right keywords. And doing that equals better SEO results.\n\nFurther reading: SEO vs. PPC: What the Differences Are & When to Use Each\n\nHow to Identify Search Terms \n\nIdentifying relevant search terms for your business is the first step in developing an effective search engine marketing strategy.\n\nHere are six ways to do that.\n\nView Search Terms in Google Ads \nSearch Terms Report \n\nThe Search Terms Report in Google Ads shows you the exact search terms that triggered your PPC campaign ads.\n\nTo access it, go to your Google Ads account.\n\nClick “Campaigns” from the left-side menu.

These include rich snippets, the local pack, People Also Ask, images, and more.\nPaid search info: Information relevant to Google Ads: CPC (cost per click), competition level, product listing ads, and more\n\nTo get personalized recommendations for your website, enter your specific domain:\n\nYou’ll now see:\n\nPersonal keyword difficulty (PKD): How difficult it would be for your website to rank for the keyword \nTopical authority: How relevant your content as a whole is to the analyzed keyword \nPotential Position: The rank you could achieve by creating high-quality content\nCurrent Position: Where you’re ranking now (if applicable)\nFind New Keyword Variations \n\nDig deeper into keywords and discover other target keywords with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nGenerate thousands of keyword ideas based on seed keywords.

Enter your basic topic or root search term in the search bar. Click “Explore.” \n\nYou’ll see information about your term, such as interest over time:\n\nOr interest by region and subregion. \n\nAnd related topics and queries. \n\nRefine your search by adjusting the time range, category, and search type, such as web, image, and news. \n\nHow Search Intent Affects Search Terms \n\nSearch intent is the underlying goal or motivation behind a user's search query. Their “why.” \n\nThere are four main types of search intent: \n\nInformational: Users are looking for information. Like an answer to a question. A solution to a problem. Or an explanation of a topic.\nCommercial: Considering a purchase, but not yet decided on which one. They’re browsing product or brand options. \nTransactional: A user is ready to take action. Like making a purchase. Signing up for a newsletter. Downloading a free ebook. \nNavigational: Navigational intent indicates the user is trying to get somewhere online. Like logging into their banking account or Instagram profile. \n\nPages that meet the searcher's intent usually have higher SEO rankings. \n\nApproach content with search intent in mind. Give the user exactly what they’re looking for. \n\nFor example: If you’re writing content about “fast dinner recipes,” don’t create four-hour recipe content. \n\nGive users what they asked for. \n\nThey’ll like it. And Google will reward it.\n\nSearch Term Examples \nPaid Advertising Search Terms Example \n\nLet’s say you’re a plumber in Los Angeles managing your own Google Ads account. \n\nYou add the keyword “plumber” to your campaign. Which means your ads could show up when potential customers search for \"plumber\" on Google.\n\nSomeone in Los Angeles Googles “top LA plumbers.” Your ad shows up in their search results.\n\nIn this example, the search term was “top LA plumbers.” \n\nAnd the keyword was “plumber.” \n\nYour ad showed up because you added that keyword to your Google Ads campaign. And the search term the searcher used contained your keyword.\n\nOrganic Search Terms Example \n\nSay you’re creating a page for your website. And you want it to appear in Google search results. \n\nSpecifically, when someone searches for plumbing services in your area. So, you optimize the page for this keyword: “Los Angeles plumber.”\n\nLike this:\n\nNot everyone who lands on your new page will type that exact phrase into Google. They’ll use variations. \n\nLike:\n\nBest plumber in Los Angeles\nAffordable Los Angeles plumbers\nPlumbing services LA\nLos Angeles emergency plumber\nPlumber near me (if the searcher is in L.A.)\n\nThese are all search terms. But the result is the same:\n\nThey share search intent with the keyword you’re targeting, so Google knows your page is the best solution to their query. As long as it’s properly optimized and satisfies search intent. \n\nTurn Search Terms into Valuable Keywords \n\nFinding and analyzing search terms for your website is just step one. \n\nYou must also optimize your pages for those terms. \n\nThat’s where the On Page SEO Checker tool comes in. \n\nIt compares your pages to the top 10 organic competitors for each target keyword. And provides actionable optimization ideas. \n\nUse it to:\n\nSee how well your pages are optimized for your target keywords\nGet suggestions on how to improve your content, title tags, and meta descriptions\nUnderstand the SERP features you can rank for and how\n\nAnd more. \n\nGet Optimization Ideas\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nSign Up Now →\n\nSimply enter your domain and the keywords you want to rank for. And you’ll see a dashboard with tons of optimization ideas. \n\nLike this:\n\nStart by tackling the pages in the “TOP pages to optimize” list first. These will yield the best results. \n\nClick the “# ideas” blue button to see the different ideas to improve the page.\n\nYou’ll see different ideas for that page, sorted by category. And information about what to do, why, and how. \n\nDo this for each page and you’ll be well on your way to higher rankings. And well ahead of your competition.",
