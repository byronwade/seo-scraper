  "content": "Your SEO headline is crucial for standing out in search and generating clicks to your site.\n\nWriting great headlines can help you generate more traffic—a lot more.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn what turns a good headline into a great headline and how to write them in just six steps. Plus, get a set of powerful templates you can use to write compelling headlines for every page on your site.\n\nWhat Is an SEO Headline?\n\nThe SEO headline refers to the title that’s shown when a page appears in the search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nThe headline can be optimized and carefully crafted to rank higher in search results. This increases the page’s visibility and can help generate more clicks from search engines (also known as organic traffic).\n\nIn many cases, the headline shown in search results will match the HTML <title> tag added to the header of the page. \n\nThis title tag is the page’s official title and what appears in the browser window or tab when the page is open. \n\nBut the SEO headline is not always the same as the page’s title tag.\n\nIn some cases, Google may choose to display the H1 tag as the SEO headline.\n\nThe H1 tag on your page will often match the page’s title. But, again, they don’t have to match. Your page’s H1 is an independent HTML element—meant to contain the main headline for the page’s content.\n\nFinally, Google will sometimes create a totally new SEO headline that appears in the SERP rather than using either the title or H1. \n\nWe’ll cover this in the Dealing with Title Rewrites section.\n\nWhy SEO Titles Matter\n\nWriting SEO-friendly headlines can dramatically increase your organic traffic (traffic from search engines). \n\nWe know this for two reasons:\n\n1. Headlines Are an SEO Ranking Factor\n\nGoogle Search Advocate John Mueller confirmed that title tags are a ranking factor for Google. Ranking factors are the different variables that Google uses to decide where a page ranks in the list of search results.\n\nAlthough he calls the impact, “tiny,” it still means an optimized title can help your page appear higher on the search engine results page (SERP).\n\nA higher position in the SERP means you’ll usually see more clicks.\n\nHow many more clicks?\n\nAccording to a Backlinko study, the top-ranking result on a Google SERP has an average click-through rate (CTR) of about 27.6%. The link in position two has a CTR of 15.8%.\n\nThis means writing good headlines is an important part of search engine optimization and your overall content marketing strategy.\n\n2. Headlines Affect Click-Through Rate\n\nWe also know that optimizing your headlines can improve your CTR from the SERPs.\n\nFor example, that same study from Backlinko found that titles with a positive sentiment (i.e., containing words like “best” and “healthiest”) could have a 4.1% higher CTR than titles with a negative sentiment.\n\nAnd basic copywriting techniques can entice more Google users to click your SEO headline.\n\nSo, if you improve your title tag, you could see more traffic even if your ranking doesn’t improve.\n\nNote: While it’s been hotly debated for years, Google representatives say CTR is not a ranking factor. In other words, improving your CTR alone likely won’t improve your ranking. But it will mean more traffic.\n\nWhat Makes an SEO Headline ‘Good’?\n\nGreat headlines aren’t just catchy.\n\nThey include proven headline writing strategies that attract the reader’s eye and attention.\n\nFor many marketers, the hardest part about crafting SEO titles is ensuring that they appeal to both humans and search engines. \n\nIn short: \n\nGreat titles are clear and compelling. They reveal what the content is about but also entice the searcher to click for more.\n\nLet’s look at the elements you need to write a great SEO headline.\n\nKeyword Optimization\n\nIncluding the target keyword in your SEO headline is best practice. \n\nKeywords tell both search engines and human readers what your content is about. \n\nThe headline below includes a primary keyword (“on-page SEO”) at the beginning of the title.\n\nIn some cases, it’s OK to use a close alternative or synonym if the target keyword doesn’t fit naturally into the title. \n\nBut avoid using repetitive language or jamming a bunch of unrelated keywords (“keyword stuffing”) into your headline. That would look spammy and could hurt performance.\n\nMatching Search Intent\n\nSEO titles should reflect the search intent of the search term.\n\nWhat is search intent?\n\nIt describes the type of content that the searcher is hoping to find, based on their query.\n\nFor example, if someone searches for “J Dilla albums,” they’re probably expecting to find a list of albums released by hip-hop producer and rapper, J Dilla (i.e., his discography):\n\nIf your title tag indicates a different type of content (e.g., “Who is J Dilla?”), the searcher might assume that it doesn’t provide the information they want.\n\nSo they won’t click.\n\nMatching search intent involves understanding both the type of content and format (e.g., listicles vs. landing pages) that the searcher is looking for.\n\nSearch intent is generally classified in four ways:\n\nNavigational: Users are looking for a site or page by name (“j dilla discogs page”)\nInformational: Users are looking for information on a topic (“j dilla biography”)\nCommercial: Users are looking for information about a specific type of product or service (“best j dilla books”)\nTransactional: Users are looking to make a purchase or complete a transaction (“buy j dilla albums”)\n\nTo identify the search intent for any given keyword, use Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool.\n\nWe’ll cover how to do this later in the article.\n\nIdentify Search Intent of Any Keyword\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nOptimal Character Count\n\nYour SEO title only gets so much real estate in the SERPs. If the title is too long, it could be cut off and display an ellipsis.\n\nIt’s important to optimize the length of your headline to try to maximize your space while keeping it within the limitations of the SERP.\n\nYour headline can take up 600 pixels before it risks getting cut off.\n\nThat’s generally 55-60 total characters. But it will depend on the content because some letters and characters take up more space than others.\n\nThis applies to both desktop and mobile SEO.\n\nPower Words and Emotional Triggers\n\nPower words add life to titles by getting your audience to feel a certain emotion as they read. They can “punch up” your headline and evoke a response from the searcher.\n\nUse them sparingly (i.e., one or two per title) to maintain their impact.\n\nFor example, do you want your audience to feel confident and empowered? \n\nWords like these can help:\n\nConquer\nThrive\nUnbeatable\nEffortless\n\nBut that’s just the start.\n\nYou can use all kinds of creative adjectives and modifiers to help your headline stand out in the SERPs. Experiment with different words to find what works best for your audience.\n\nClarity and Simplicity\n\nFinally, it’s important to keep in mind that headlines send a message.\n\nIf you get too creative or too clever with your headline, it may become confusing or difficult to understand. Always prioritize clarity and readability over cleverness.\n\nFor instance, a title with a metaphor or pun might not make sense right away to someone skimming the SERPs. \n\n“SEO Headlines That’ll Make You Flip Your Wig,” might be a creative take. But it’s just as likely to confuse the reader as it is to get them clicking.\n\nHow to Write an SEO Headline: Step-by-Step Guide\n\nLet’s walk through the process of writing a headline from scratch in six steps.\n\n1. Start with Keyword Research\n\nFirst, determine the primary keyword of the page. This will need to appear in your title tag. \n\nAnd if any secondary keywords would add more context, include them, too.\n\nWhen you include keywords in SEO titles, it’s common practice to place them at the very beginning whenever possible.\n\nThis isn’t a strict rule. But that’s where they’re more likely to get attention.\n\nAs an example, we’ll create an SEO title for the article you’re reading. \n\nThe target keyword is “SEO headline,” which we’ll plan to place at the very beginning of the title:\n\nIf you have a secondary keyword that you’re targeting (e.g., a close variation of the primary keyword,) then you should consider including that, too. \n\n2. Analyze the SERP and Match Search Intent\n\nNext, we want to analyze the SERP to understand what already ranks for this query and what readers are looking for when they Google this term.\n\nWe’ll use the Keyword Overview tool.\n\nIn Semrush, click “Keyword Overview” underneath “Keyword Research” in the left-hand navigation.\n\nNow, from the “Keyword Overview” page, type the keyword into the text box. Then click “Search.”\n\nNow, Semrush will return the “Keyword Overview” report for this query. Right at the top, you’ll see a widget labeled “Intent,” which automatically categorizes the search intent for this query into one of a few different buckets (sometimes, even two.)\n\nIn this case, Semrush identified that the keyword has informational search intent.\n\nThis means that the content that appears in the SERPs is generally educational—guides, blog posts, etc.\n\nThis gives you a head start on understanding the search intent for this query. But you can go one step further by also reviewing the SERP and the SEO headlines of the other pages that already rank. \n\nGoing back to the “Keyword Overview” page, scroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section, which shows a recreation of the SERP for this particular keyword. Click “View SERP” in the top right.\n\nThis will return a cached version of the Google search results for this query. Now, your job is to analyze the headlines that rank here. And learn a bit more about the kinds of titles (and content) searchers expect.\n\nAnalyze the SERP for indicators about the query and the searcher.\n\nConsider:\n\nWho is the target audience that might be searching for this?\nHow much does the searcher already know about the topic?\nWhat is the searcher looking to take away from the content? \nIs the searcher a beginner or more advanced?\n\nIn this case, we can see a few takeaways that emerge from the top-ranking pages for “SEO headlines”:\n\nIntermediate content. The pages aren’t explaining the concept of an SEO headline. They’re explaining how to write them effectively.\nActionable. Most of the titles indicate that the content contains “tips,” “ways,” or a process for “how to” write the headlines.\n\nWe’ll use this information to expand our working title: “SEO Headlines: How to Write Titles.”\n\nThis is still a rough draft, but it gives us an idea of where we’re heading.\n\nRun a Full Keyword Analysis\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Punch It Up with Power Words\n\nNow that we have a foundation for the keyword, let’s spice it up.\n\nAt this stage, we can experiment by adding power words to evoke emotion and help our title stand out from the crowd.\n\nWe might try something like one of these examples:\n\nSEO Headlines: How to Write Incredible Titles\nSEO Headlines: The Easiest Way to Write Strong Titles\nSEO Headlines: A Perfect Process for Writing Great Titles\n4. Add a Number\n\nIf it makes sense, you may consider adding a relevant number to your headline. \n\nE.g., “9 tips” or “10 facts.”\n\nNumbers and statistics can improve SEO titles for a couple reasons:\n\nThey create a pattern interrupt, which can draw the reader’s eye\nThey quantify what the content conveys, which can help users assess value quickly\n\nThe example headline below calls out, “27 of the Biggest SEO Mistakes,” to give readers a preview of what the article covers.\n\nThat said, don’t include numbers in headlines just for the sake of adding numbers. We conducted an SEO split test and found removing unnecessary numbers from a website’s headlines actually increased CTRs.\n\nLet’s see how a number works in our example headline:\n\nSEO Headlines: 6 Ways to Write Incredible Titles\nSEO Headlines: The 5 Easiest Ways to Write Strong Titles\nSEO Headlines: A Perfect Process for Writing Great Titles (Plus 9 Free Templates)\n\nBut we also need to make sure that the headline matches the content of the article. Our goal isn’t to write a clickbait headline that doesn’t pay off for the reader.\n\nSince we aren’t covering multiple “ways” or “tips,” we might instead focus on the steps we’re going through right now. \n\nMaybe:\n\nSEO Headlines: How to Write Titles That Rank in Just 6 Steps\n\n5. Optimize the Character Count\n\nNext we need to optimize the length of the title to fit within our 600-pixel space.\n\nTo do this, we recommend keeping the title to 55-60 characters. \n\nIf you want to test the title length and get an idea for how it will look in the SERP, you can use a tool like Yoast SEO plugin for WordPress. \n\nOur previous headline fits within the character count. We could take this title and run with it.\n\nOr we could continue to test and tweak it some more. \n\nUltimately, we decided to highlight the headline templates provided below as a main selling point and come up with some new title ideas.\n\nOur final title:\n\nHow to Write SEO Headlines That Rank (+9 Powerful Templates)\n\nBonus Step: Measure the Emotional Marketing Value of Your Headline\n\nThe Advanced Marketing Institute Headline Analyzer tool reveals the emotional marketing value (EMV) of any title. \n\nTo see this metric, enter a title (up to 20 words long) and click the “Submit for Analysis” button.\n\nThe tool scores your title’s use of power words or emotional language on a scale of 0-100%.\n\n6. Test Variations for Best Performance\n\nThe first SEO title you create doesn’t have to remain the title tag forever. If you notice that a page or post isn’t getting the search traffic you anticipated, consider testing alternatives.\n\nYou can use Semrush’s SplitSignal tool to easily launch and measure SEO A/B tests on all kinds of page elements, including the headline.\n\nTo get started, you’ll need to set up and install SplitSignal on your domain.\n\nOnce that’s done, from inside SplitSignal, you’ll click on the name of your project. Then click the “Create new test” button.\n\nNow, go through the set up. On the “Name test” step, you’ll provide a “Test name” and a “Test description” in the appropriate text boxes. Then click “Create.”\n\nOn the “Inspect structure” step, select the path where the page(s) you want to test live on your site. For instance, if you want to test the headline of a specific blog post, you would select the “/blog/” directory from the list.\n\nNote: If you want to test multiple pages in multiple directories on your site, you’ll probably want to set up separate tests rather than trying to target them all with one test. \n\nOn the “Filter pages” step, you’ll specify the exact URLs you want to target. Using the drop-downs, select “URL,” “Contains,” and then type the URL of the page you want to test. \n\nOn the “Create rules” step, you’ll select “Change the text content of an element” from rule dropdown. Then type “title” into the “CSS selector” text box. In the “Test value template” text box, type the new title you want to test for this specific page. Click “Next.”\n\nIn the final step, “Review and launch,” you’ll review the details of the step. Set the duration of the test (how many days you want to test the new title). Then click “Launch.”\n\nNow SplitSignal will automatically test the new title and generate a report that shows you how the new title affected your page’s organic search traffic. \n\nTest Your SEO Titles\n\nwith SplitSignal\n\nTry for Free →\n9 Powerful SEO Headline Templates\n\nNeed inspiration to create great headlines that grab the reader’s attention?

In other cases, they may totally rewrite your title. Using your H1 tag or a subheading or an entirely new title based on the contents of the page.\n\nOne study found that approximately 61% of all SEO headlines are rewritten to some degree.\n\nThis can be frustrating.\n\nEspecially if you’ve spent a lot of time crafting a perfect headline, only to have Google decide to ignore it entirely. \n\nLuckily, Google has provided some guidance on when and why they “generate” (read: rewrite) headlines. (They call these “title links.”)\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nOverly long titles are more likely to be rewritten\nKeyword stuffing can trigger your titles to be rewritten\nBoilerplate titles or title templates are likely to be rewritten\n\nIf you’re running into issues with this, try reviewing the documentation and adjusting your approach. If you have a large site with many pages that have programmatically generated titles, you might consider rewriting some of these manually. \n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n1. Is the SEO Headline a Google Ranking Factor?\n\nYes. John Mueller has confirmed that Google’s algorithm does consider the page’s title or headline as a factor when determining search engine ranking. Of course, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Backlinks and website authority, quality content, and user experience also play a role.\n\n2. What Makes a Compelling SEO Headline?\n\nA great SEO headline is clear, concise, and engaging. It incorporates primary keywords and conveys the nature of the content accurately. It also considers the audience’s search intent and addresses their questions or goals.\n\n3. How Do I Update My SEO Headline in WordPress?\n\nIn many WordPress themes, your page’s title and headline will be the same as the article or page name. If you want to customize the headline to be something different, you can use a plugin like Yoast SEO.\n\n4. Is an SEO Headline the Same as a Social Media Headline?\n\nNot necessarily. Your page’s SEO headline can be different from the headline that appears when an article is shared on social media such as LinkedIn. The social media headline is usually determined by an “og:title” meta tag in your page’s header.\n\n5. Does Case Matter in an SEO Headline?\n\nCapitalization case doesn’t affect how the page ranks. However, using a standard format like sentence or title case can make the title easier for users to read and understand. That could lead to a higher click-through rate and drive more traffic.",
