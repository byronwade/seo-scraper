Which can help you find keywords you can target to increase your visibility and grow your subscriber base.\n\nBut before we get to the tools, let’s go over the basics. \n\nWhat Is YouTube Keyword Research? \n\nYouTube keyword research is the process of finding popular keywords that viewers use in their YouTube searches. So you can incorporate those terms in your video content.\n\nFor example, if you type “How to start a youtube channel” into the YouTube search bar, you might see the following suggested queries:\n\nThese suggested search queries are essentially other keywords (also called search terms and YouTube keywords) people search for related to their initial search.\n\nAnalyzing these keywords gives insight into the search intent (the reason why someone searches for a given keyword) behind search queries. \n\nFor example, the suggested keyword “how to start a youtube channel for beginners” indicates searchers want tips for YouTube newcomers.\n\nYou can analyze the search intent of this query by looking at the words within it.\n\nThe words “how to” indicate the searcher wants a guide or tutorial. “For beginners” means they want step-by-step guidance tailored specifically for newcomers to YouTube. Not experienced YouTubers.\n\nYour goal with YouTube keyword research is to identify keywords that will help you create videos aligned with searcher intent.\n\nFurther reading: YouTube Keyword Research: How to Find Popular Search Terms\n\nWhy Is YouTube Keyword Research Important?\n\nYouTube keyword research is important because it helps you find terms you can use to create relevant video content your target viewers are searching for.\n\nFocusing on those search queries as you create video content allows you to optimize for video SEO (a set of tactics that help you rank on Google and YouTube). Those tactics include incorporating keywords into your video titles and descriptions.\n\nAnd effective YouTube keyword research will help you:\n\nCreate content that aligns with what viewers are actively looking for\nCreate optimized YouTube video content around relevant keywords to help you grow your subscriber base\n\nFurther reading: YouTube SEO: How to Create a YouTube Channel and Promote it\n\n​​The 9 Best YouTube Keyword Tools\n\nNow, let’s take a look at some of the best YouTube keyword tools.\n\n1. Keyword Analytics for YouTube \n\nKeyword Analytics for YouTube is a dedicated YouTube keyword research tool that lets you uncover popular terms and YouTube search trends you can create content around.\n\nThe default dashboard gives you an overview of the “Top Keywords” for a given country and time range (“Last Day,” “Last Week,” and “Last Month”):\n\nYou can filter and view each period’s most popular search terms by clicking on the corresponding tab.\n\nYou can also easily find related keywords for a specific keyword using the “Search” function.\n\nFor example, you can enter “start a youtube channel” in the search bar and click “Search.” \n\nYou’ll then see related keywords. Including “simple reliable gear for starting a youtube channel” and “best equipment to buy for starting a youtube channel.”\n\nThese are long-tail variations (highly specific search terms) of the keyword that could be relevant for your audience. \n\nAnalyzing these keywords can give you ideas for more targeted content around starting a YouTube channel.\n\nPro tip: You can track your channel’s performance for your target keywords with Rank Tracker for YouTube.\n\nWith Keyword Analytics for YouTube, you can uncover insights such as:\n\nSearch volume\nKeywords by country\nKeyword popularity trends\nTop videos related to trending keywords\nThe most popular keywords on YouTube by day, week, or month\n\nThese insights can help you to make data-driven decisions to help you create content that will better resonate with your audience.\n\nUncover Valuable YouTube Keywords\n\nwith Keyword Analytics for YouTube\n\nTry for Free →\nWhat We Like\n\nThe “Competitive Rate” score (pictured on the right side of the below image) allows you to better understand whether a keyword is worth targeting. \n\nThe score is out of 100. And a lower score means fewer content creators are targeting that keyword. \n\nSo, a channel with fewer than 1 million subscribers has a better chance of ranking high in YouTube search results for a keyword with a score of 20 than for a keyword with a score of 80.\n\nPricing\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Analytics for YouTube costs $10 per month. A seven-day free trial is also available.\n\n2. Rank Tracker for YouTube\n\nThe Rank Tracker for YouTube lets you see where your videos rank in YouTube search results. So you can identify opportunities for improvement.\n\nFirst, you’ll need to add your YouTube channel and target keywords. \n\n(The base subscription allows you to manage an unlimited number of channels and track up to 200 keywords. But you can increase your limit to a maximum of 1,200 keywords.)\n\nYou can enter keywords manually, import them from YouTube Studio, or import them from Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder tool.\n\nOnce setup is complete, you’ll go to the “Overview” tab.\n\nWhere you can find the following data for the previous week:\n\nYour average ranking for all target keywords\nYour keyword ranking distribution (Top 3, Top 10, Top 20, or No Rank)\nHow many rankings have increased, decreased, and stayed the same\n\nClick the “Keywords” tab to see your ranking for each target keyword.\n\nPlus:\n\nHow this ranking has changed over the past week\nThe title of the ranking video (if you rank in the top 20)\nThe average monthly search volume for the target keyword\n\nTo analyze the main competition for any keyword, click “Preview” in the “YouTube results” column.\n\nYou’ll see the ranking, thumbnail, duration, title, and publish date for the top 20 videos. You can also see which channels published them and how many views they’ve got.\n\nClick through to view the videos or channels for yourself. And collect more useful intel.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe Rank Tracker for YouTube makes it easy to monitor your YouTube SEO results. And identify the best opportunities for improvement.\n\nIf you have a low ranking—or you notice a ranking drop—you can quickly analyze the competition. And make changes to your own video strategy.\n\nPricing\n\nThe Rank Tracker for YouTube app comes with a free seven-day trial.\n\nYou can track up to 200 keywords for $19 a month or use in-app purchases to increase your limit.\n\n3. Google Trends\n\nGoogle Trends is typically used to see the popularity of Google search queries in real time. But you can also use it to find trends in YouTube searches.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEnter a keyword into the search bar and click “Explore”:\n\nOnce in the tool, select the drop-down menu that says “Web Search” and change it to “YouTube Search”:\n\nIn the time period drop-down menu, select “2008 - present” to view keyword trends for the full available date range:\n\nAnd you’ll get a graph showing the keyword’s popularity over time. Peaks show times of high interest. Low points show times with less interest.\n\nFor example, searches for “how to start a youtube channel” peaked in May of 2020.\n\nYou can also compare multiple search terms by clicking “+ Add comparison” and entering another keyword. \n\nFor example, “how to start a youtube channel” versus “how to become an influencer” looks like this:\n\nComparing keywords shows their relative popularity over time. And can tell you which keyword has historically been more popular for YouTube searches\n\nThese insights can help you make more informed keyword choices. \n\nFor example, the comparison above shows that:\n\nSearches for “how to start a youtube channel” are more popular than “how to become an influencer”\nInterest in “how to become an influencer” has been slowly rising since May 2022\nInterest in “how to start a youtube channel” declined but rose rapidly in May 2022\n\nKnowing this could suggest that “how to start a youtube channel” is likely a better keyword to target right now. And that viewers have a growing interest in content about becoming a YouTuber in general (meaning beyond just YouTube).\n\nGoogle Trends can also help uncover additional YouTube keyword opportunities to expand your research.\n\nRelated queries: Discover other keywords (including “Breakout” ones that have recently seen a 5,000% increase in search volume) people search for that are relevant to your keyword. This can uncover keyword ideas you may have missed.\nRelated topics: Identify related topics people who entered your search term also searched for\nWhat We Like\n\nGoogle Trends can help you understand how a search query’s popularity has changed over time. And determine whether a topic has peaked or is still worth covering.\n\nFor example, interest in the search query “how to start a youtube channel” in the United States peaked in popularity during 2016:\n\nBut you can see from the same chart that it’s starting to gain momentum again:\n\nThis feature helps you identify topics that are rising in popularity. So you can create content while interest is on the rise (or avoid topics that are on the decline). \n\nPricing\n\nGoogle Trends is a free YouTube keyword tool.\n\n4. YouTube Search Predictions\n\nYou can use the autocomplete function on YouTube (officially called search predictions) as a keyword suggestion tool. Because it displays suggested search queries as soon as you start typing into the search bar. \n\nIt uses a combination of factors like the popularity of search terms and your past searches to generate suggestions. \n\nYou’ll get more specific terms as you enter more words into the bar. \n\nFor example, if you enter “youtube channel” into the search bar you may see broad search terms such as “youtube channel ideas” or “youtube channel tips”:\n\nBut if you enter “how to start a youtube channel,” you may get specific searches such as “how to start a youtube channel without showing your face” or “how to start a youtube channel for beginners with a phone.”\n\nThe more specific search terms that YouTube suggests provide insights into the different angles and subtopics people are interested in related to your broader topic.\n\nKnowing these specific keyword variations and subtopics allows you to create content that caters to what people are searching for.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nYouTube’s autocomplete function reflects what users are currently searching for. This means you're getting insight into what YouTube audiences are interested in right now.\n\nFor example, if you enter “how to start a youtube channel,” you may notice the search query “how to start a youtube channel without showing your face”:\n\nIt may be worth creating a video around this topic if your channel focuses on helping people getting started on YouTube.\n\nAnd the suggested searches you see will evolve over time based on user behavior. So, regularly re-checking the suggested searches for your core keywords provides visibility into which related topics are gaining or declining in popularity. \n\nThis allows you to continually update your YouTube content strategy to align with the search terms viewers are using.\n\nPricing\n\nYouTube search predictions is a free feature.\n\n5. YouTube’s Trending Page\n\nAlthough not explicitly designed for it, the YouTube Trending page can be a valuable keyword research tool. Because it helps you find popular topics.\n\nThe default dashboard gives you an overview of the top trending YouTube videos and Shorts right now:\n\nThe trending YouTube videos and Shorts are the same in every country. So, it’s not personalized. And you might see videos in other languages, too.\n\nThe Trending list updates about every 15 minutes. With each update, videos move up, down, or occupy the same spot depending on their performance.\n\nAnd you can leverage the Trending page to:\n\nIdentify viral formats or styles to emulate in your content\nSee which topics that you could cover drive a lot of interest\nGauge what thumbnails, titles, and descriptions draw viewer clicks\nWhat We Like\n\nThe content on the YouTube trending page gives you a real-time snapshot on videos gaining momentum right now.\n\nFor example, the majority of content shown is just hours or days old:\n\nThis gives you a real-time look at trending videos and allows you to capitalize on popularity.\n\nPricing\n\nYouTube Trending is a free YouTube keyword tool.\n\n6. VidIQ\n\nVidIQ is a video creator platform that offers several features, including a keyword research tool, SEO tag suggestions, and competitor channel tracking. \n\nThe “Keywords” dashboard displays two modules for keyword research: “Top keyword opportunities” and “Rising keywords”:\n\nThe “Top keyword opportunities” section is generated based on the keywords you add to the tool.\n\nFor example, if you add “how to start a youtube channel” and “how to become an influencer,” you may see keyword opportunities like the ones below:\n\nThese are keywords you should consider targeting in your videos.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nVidIQ has a Chrome extension that allows you to do keyword research directly on YouTube.\n\nYou can use it to see the “Top related opportunities” for a given keyword. \n\nFor example, you may see the following keywords listed if you search “how to start a youtube channel”:\n\nYou can also see the “Top channels” for a specific search term.\n\nYou might see the following channels for the search term “how to start a youtube channel”:\n\nWhy is this useful?\n\nIt helps identify competitors and influential creators in your niche. Analyzing their content and channel strategy can provide insights for your own YouTube presence.\n\nOr, it can help you to discover relevant collaborators or guests for your videos based on channels ranking well for your target terms. \n\nPricing\n\nVidIQ has a free plan. And three paid plans:\n\nBasic: Free\nPro: Starts at $7.50 per month\nBoost: Starts at $39 per month\nMax: Starts at $79 per month\n7. TubeBuddy\n\nTubeBuddy is a browser extension for YouTube creators that offers features like keyword research, tag suggestions, and general SEO guidance. \n\nThe Keyword Explorer feature is similar to other tools on this list in that it will help you find valuable search terms relevant to your niche.\n\nKeyword Explorer provides several metrics on keywords, including:\n\nSearch volume\nCompetition score (how competitive the keyword is)\nOptimization Strength (how well the top-ranking videos are optimized for the keyword) \n\nThe Keyword Explorer tool integrates into your YouTube dashboard and looks like this:\n\nWhat We Like\n\nTubeBuddy is good for seeing which tags top-ranking videos are using. To help you identify ones you might want to use.\n\nThis is helpful because using the correct tags on your videos can improve their visibility.\n\nYou can see the tags for this top-ranking video on starting a YouTube channel in 2023 in the image below:\n\nPricing\n\nTubeBuddy has a free plan.

Keywords Everywhere\n\nKeywords Everywhere is a browser extension for keyword research. And it can be used for YouTube to show several keyword-related metrics.\n\nThat includes:\n\nSearch volume\nCost per click (CPC)—the amount advertisers pay each time someone clicks their ad targeting that keyword\nSearch trends over the last 12 months\n\nThe metrics are all displayed inside the YouTube platform.\n\nFor every search you make, the tool also scans the results page and provides information about those videos with a widget that shares helpful metrics like average and maximum video views, how many videos use that keyword in the title, and more.\n\nAnd the “Detailed Breakdown” link shows metrics for each video result. This lets you evaluate individual results.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nYou can see data about each keyword (search volume, CPC, and search trends) inside of the search predictions box on YouTube.\n\nThis helps to speed up the keyword research process to uncover long-tail keywords that could be less competitive and more focused on your niche.\n\nPricing\n\nKeywords Everywhere uses a credit system and has four paid plans:\n\nBronze: $1.25 per month\nSilver: $4 per month\nGold: $20 per month\nPlatinum: $80 per month\n\nNote: One credit = one keyword. Credits expire after one year.\n\n9. Keyword Tool \n\nKeyword Tool can be used as a YouTube keyword tool to help you find keywords with the help of YouTube search predictions. \n\nThe tool’s interface looks similar to the Google Search homepage and supports keyword research across multiple platforms.\n\nTo generate YouTube keyword ideas, click the YouTube icon, type in your keyword, and click the search icon. \n\nIt will give you keyword data such as:\n\nMonthly search volume based on YouTube autocomplete\nTrend over the last 12 months \nAverage CPC (in USD) \nCompetition score—which reflects how many advertisers are bidding on that keyword\n\nThe tool also gives you the ability to filter keywords by “Questions,” “Prepositions,” and “Hashtags”:\n\nWhy is this useful?\n\nFiltering keywords by questions can help you find terms that directly speak to your audience’s queries\nDiscovering hashtags on popular topics and using relevant ones can make your content more discoverable\nLooking for keywords that use prepositions helps you match your content more closely to your viewers’ specific search interests.
