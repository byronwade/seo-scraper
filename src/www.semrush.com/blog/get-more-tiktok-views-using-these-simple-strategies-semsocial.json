  "content": "Over 50 million people worldwide use TikTok every day. Captivated by the addictive, short video format, they’re bombarded with content from creators and brands, all trying to catch their attention.\n\nSo, you may be asking yourself: ‘How do I get more views on TikTok?’ \n\nThere are a few fundamentals to follow to ensure you get the most out of your content and cut through. But before we get into the specifics, it’s important to remember your “why’. \n\nA staggering 43% of users admitted they tried something new or went somewhere new after seeing it in a TikTok video. To reach these potential customers, you need to get enough TikTok views.\n\nA Few Fundamentals for Getting More Views on TikTok\n\nWhether you’re a content creator, an entrepreneur promoting your new service, or selling your product online, you need to understand the mechanics of TikTok and how to engage its algorithm effectively. \n\nWhat’s Considered a TikTok View?\n\nTikTok starts counting views from the moment the video plays. If someone rewatches your video when it loops around, that also counts as a new view. However, your own views are excluded from the stats. \n\nWith this in mind, views aren’t the most important KPI to focus on. However, you need those views to gain followers, engagement, and new customers through TikTok. \n\nAbout TikTok’s Algorithm\n\nThanks to TikTok's algorithm, the average user spends 90 minutes daily streaming videos on the app. Of course, TikTok doesn’t share details about its proprietary algorithm, but it gives us plenty of clues about the ranking factors. \n\nEach user’s For You feed contains curated videos based on their interests and the content they’ve previously watched and engaged with. It also includes enough variety to maintain the viewer’s interest.  \n\nWhen you first publish a video, TikTok shows it to a small subset of your potential audience, including followers and non-followers. Your reach largely depends on how those viewers engage with your video and how much of it they watch.\n\nEngagement feeds the algorithm with the following factors about users, which determines whether they see your videos:\n\n🙋 Accounts followed\n\n👍 Videos liked or shared\n\n💬 Comments made\n\n🎶 Music preferences\n\nVideos that receive more likes, shares and comments, and have longer watch times are more likely to be pushed to the For You pages of other users. \n\nTo get more views through users' For You recommendations, you’ll want to create and optimize your videos so that TikTok shows them to people who will watch the whole video and engage. It goes without saying that a strategy that creates interesting content tailored for discovery and engagement should see increased views. \n\nEngagement is the CEO of Getting More TikTok Views \nKnow Your Audience \n\nAll effective marketing strategies are based on understanding your ideal customer or target audience. Creating content that interests and engages is easier when you know who uses your product or service and why.\n\nIf you have drafted customer personas, consider whether people matching those personas would be on TikTok. With TikTok’s global reach, it’s pretty likely your potential customers are there. \n\nIn the USA alone, Pew Research found that one-third of Americans use TikTok. Since 62% of adults under 30 use it, that number may continue to grow despite TikTok’s recent legal challenges. \n\nWhen brainstorming topics and strategies, always keep in mind any relevant customer personas. To get started, consider the following questions:\n\n🤔 What questions do your prospective customers have? Do they have any myths or misconceptions that you can clarify?\n\n👍 What are their pain points? How does your product or service offer relief?\n\n🎞️ What entertainment do they enjoy? What kind sense of humor do they have? \n\n📱 When they have 15 minutes free, what do they look up on their phone?\n\n⭐ Case Study: Canadian retailer @LalahHijabs uses TikTok to reach a niche market. Her content includes demonstrations of hijabs and accessories. She also answers customer questions, solving their challenges and pain points. \n\nHow to Get More Views Through Cross-Promotion\n\nIf you have an established following on other platforms, consider cross-promoting your TikTok videos on those platforms. Cross-promotion is a highly effective way to get more views on TikTok after posting a video. Begin by promoting your TikTok content through your website, other socials, or your newsletter. \n\nAnother option is to link your TikTok account to your other social media profiles. Your followers can then find you on TikTok, and you can share your TikTok content directly on platforms like Instagram and Facebook.\n\nIf you prefer, you can selectively share your TikTok content. When you publish a video on another platform you want to share, don't just post the video: include a call-to-action to encourage your followers to check out your TikTok content. \n\nRemember, each social media platform has its own audience and content style. Tailor your cross-promotion strategy to fit the platform you're posting on. By effectively cross-promoting your TikTok content, you can drive more traffic to your videos, increase your views, and grow your TikTok following.\n\nFor effortless cross-promotion, check out Semrush Poster. Our tool lets you draft, schedule, and post content on Facebook (Business Pages), LinkedIn, Instagram, Google Business Profile, Pinterest, Twitter, and TikTok all from one place. \n\nSimplify Your TikTok Workflow\n\nPlan, schedule, and post your TikTok videos all in one place with Semrush's Social Poster.\n\nTry now →\nCreating Useful Content \n\nIt’s important to create content for both views and engagement. This is because they form a feedback loop and amplify each other. Good examples of useful content include: \n\n👍 Product demonstrations\n\n👍 Tutorials\n\n👍 Life hacks\n\n👍 Anything that makes your ideal customer’s life easier\n\n⭐ Case Study: @EatFishWife is credited with renewing interest in tinned fish through its stylish packaging and social media content. They share recipes featuring their product as well as behind-the-scenes updates. \n\nMix Up Your Length of Videos\n\nTikTok allows you to film content up to 60 seconds long and to upload videos up to three minutes in length. An analysis by Social Insider indicates that TikTok videos that are 15 seconds or shorter have a view rate of 9.4%. After 15 seconds, the view rate drops to 7.84%.\n\nHowever, with TikTok wanting to take a bite out of YouTube’s viewership pie, their algorithm has begun to favor longer format videos. So, we recommend using a mix of both.\n\nThe important thing to remember is to keep the viewer engaged until the end!\n\n⭐ Case Study: Not to toot our own horn, but Semrush publishes short and humorous videos on topics many marketers and social media managers can relate to. One easy format is to use two contrasting photos or video clips comparing the ideal to the real-world version. \n\nUse Popular Songs and Trending Sounds\n\nAccording to 90% of TikTok users, sound is a key element of the TikTok experience. While TikTok has moved beyond lip-synching videos, the platform still attracts music enthusiasts. TikTok reports that 62% of its U.S. users are paid subscribers to at least one music streaming service, compared to 43% of the general public. \n\nIf you have fewer than 5,000 followers, using a trendy song may be one of the best ways to boost your views and engagement. According to Social Insider, this increases engagement by 20% for small accounts. TikTok’s own study found that 68% of users said they are more likely to remember a brand that uses popular music in their content. \n\nMake the most of TikTok’s music library by adding trending songs to your videos so the song is tagged and you benefit from any interest. If you are unsure which songs are trending, look at the song’s stats to see whether people are still using it. TikTok’s Creative Center is also a great place to find trending music. \n\nOriginal sound also has its place, especially if you need to speak to your audience. TikTok found that 65% of users appreciated brand content featuring original sounds. The takeaway is to choose your soundtrack carefully and pick what best fits your message, whether it’s a trending song or your own original sound. \n\n⭐ Case Study: Simple videos with popular songs can be surprisingly engaging. Sometimes, a vintage song becomes popular on TikTok. In 2020, creator @420doggface208 went viral with a video of himself skating and sipping Ocean Spray cranberry juice while listening to Fleetwood Mac’s song “Dreams.” He started a trend, and others created their own versions. \n\nEngage With and Mention Others\n\nEngaging with the TikTok community is a fantastic way to increase engagement and views. Look for ways to tag and interact with others organically. \n\nOne of the most effective ways to do this is by collaborating with other creators or influencers. This not only exposes your content to a new audience, but also allows you to tap into the creative energy of another creator. Reach out to creators with a following who may be interested in what you have to offer. \n\nIf viewers comment on your videos, consider making short response videos and tagging the commenter. This shows that you value your audience's input and encourages more engagement. Adding a personal touch can make your followers feel seen and appreciated, leading to more engagement and goodwill.\n\nTikTok Duets are another way to participate in the wider community. Duets are a unique TikTok feature that allows you to create a side-by-side video with another TikTok video. It’s a fun and creative way to engage with other creators, which can help increase your visibility on the platform. \n\nTikTok Live is also great for building a loyal community of people interested in your content and what you do. Engaging with your followers in real time makes them feel part of something and creates a deeper connection.\n\nRemember, the key is to be genuine and authentic in your engagement. Spammy or insincere interactions can turn off your audience and harm your reputation.\n\n⭐ Case Study: A sponsored post can still be fun and attract engagement. MorningBrew’s collaboration with Dunkin tells a relatable story and even features light parkour! \n\nGet stuck in with TikTok Trends and Challenges\n\nFeel free to join in if you notice a challenge or trend that fits your brand voice. If the trend goes viral, you may reach a larger audience and potentially attract new followers.\n\nTikTok trends often involve a specific song, dance, or concept that users recreate in their own way. Challenges, on the other hand, usually involve completing a particular task or action. Both offer a fun and creative way to engage with the TikTok community and showcase your brand's personality.\n\nYou can leverage these trends and challenges to highlight your products or services. For example, if there's a trending dance challenge, you could create a video of you or your team doing the dance in your store or office. TikTok is the place to let your brand’s fun side shine. \n\nThat said, you must make sure your participation in certain trends and challenges aligns with your brand image and values. Not every trend will be a good fit for your brand, and that's okay. The key is to choose trends that resonate with your target audience and feel authentic to your brand.\n\nAlso, remember to use relevant hashtags when participating in trends and challenges. This will make your content more discoverable to users following or searching for that trend or challenge.\n\nAnother tip is to try putting your own spin on the trend so that you stand out. The most successful TikTok content is authentic, a little informal, and creative. \n\nHook Them With a Story or Series\n\nConsider breaking a longer story into two or more parts. By publishing a series, you’re encouraging viewers to stay engaged. A multi-part series allows you to go deeper and showcase your expertise in short snack-sized videos. If you leave the viewer wanting more, they may stick around and watch a few more videos.\n\n⭐ Case Study: Shopify publishes content to inform and inspire budding e-commerce entrepreneurs with short features about successful clients. Telling a story enhances their credibility in an informal, approachable way.\n\nUse TikTok SEO to Get More Views\n\nNearly half of millenials and 64% of Gen Z use TikTok as a search engine. According to Adobe, 10% of Gen Z admitted they prefer it to Google. Since users are searching on TikTok, why not optimize your content for search? \n\nTry these tips to optimize your profile and your content.\n\nMake the Most of Hashtags\n\nHashtags play a helpful part in your TikTok SEO. They help the algorithm categorize your content so users interested in specific topics can find it. Look for relevant and trending hashtags. Also, consider creating your own branded hashtag to encourage user-generated content. \n\nA good tip is to keep a list of relevant hashtags. If you’re looking for ideas, check out the Trends page in TikTok’s Creative Center. \n\nInclude Keywords in TikTok Captions and Elsewhere\n\nThe key is to keep your TikTok captions concise and help viewers understand what’s happening, even if they watch with the sound off. But that doesn’t mean you can’t include a few carefully chosen keywords.\n\nCaptions aren’t the only place for keywords. You can also include them in your video’s:\n\n👍 description\n\n👍 title\n\n👍 hashtags\n\n👍 profile bio\n\nRemember: given the low character counts, you should choose your keywords carefully. \n\n⭐ Case Study: We all know the internet loves animal videos. But San Diego Zoo does something else well on TikTok. Captions, hashtags, and video descriptions allow tourists and locals to find the zoo’s content quickly. \n\nConsider TikTok Advertising to Increase Your Views and Audience\n\nIn addition to the organic tactics discussed above, advertising is another way to build your audience and increase views. With over 1 billion monthly active users worldwide, TikTok will be used by some of your ideal customers. If you have a business account, TikTok’s Ad Manager and Creative Tools both offer insights and tools to help you create effective ads.\n\nThere are several advertising formats to choose from:\n\nIn-feed ads are short video ads that appear within the user’s \"For You\" feed, blending seamlessly with organic content. \n\nBrand takeover is a type of ad that appears when a user first opens the app, taking over the whole screen for a few seconds before turning into an in-feed ad. While more expensive, brand takeovers can provide massive exposure and immediate attention.\n\nHashtag challenges are another uniquely engaging advertising opportunity. Brands can create a challenge around a specific hashtag and encourage users to create content, potentially leading to engagement and virality.\n\nBranded effects allow brands to create interactive elements, like filters or stickers, that users can use. This increases brand visibility and encourages user interaction.\n\nChoosing ad options that align with your brand’s personality is essential. TikTok users value genuine and entertaining content, so make sure your ads reflect that, just like your organic content.\n\nUse the Business Manager and Ad Manager to monitor your analytics. TikTok analytics can help you understand your ad performance and audience engagement, allowing you to optimize your strategy for better results.\n\n⭐ Case Study: Square features short interviews where multiple people answer the same question. They cover everything from food trends that are on their way out to rookie moves restaurant staffers made. A similar quick-take interview technique could also be good for your brand, especially if you attend events or conferences.\n\nContent Ideas that Get Views\n\nGet into the habit of producing short-form videos. This is half the struggle, and there are so many ways to reach your audience on TikTok.\n\nStart by brainstorming content ideas. Here are a few prompts to get you going:\n\nThink about myths, misconceptions, or misinformation related to your field. Post short debunking videos offering your insights.\nConsider choreographing a short dance routine to a portion of a popular song. Let each of your team take their turn.\nCreate a video tour, announcement, or staff introduction video.\nMake videos highlighting mini case studies or client testimonials. And if you can get the client to tell their story, even better! \nOffer quick recipes, product demonstrations, and life hacks that address customer pain points. \nProduce a light skit to explain a complicated concept in a straightforward way.\nThink of your favorite meme or GIF. Can you recreate it and give it a new twist?\nUse TikTok to announce sales, contests, or promotions.\nUse the Duets feature to give your take on a trend related to your industry or expertise. \nEngage your audience with photos or videos of your team members, or of customers’ pets or other animals. \nFilm skits depicting lifestyle situations where your product or service fits well. \nPost hot take or response videos reacting to the news in your area of expertise. \nChallenge your viewers to answer a question, or post a video and tag you. \nPost trivia or fun-fact quizzes.\n\nTikTok offers templates that make it easier to create short videos or slideshows. If you feel stuck, check them out. \n\nAnother great way to create content for more TikTok views is Social Content AI. The tool harnesses the power of AI to generate bespoke content ideas, compelling caption copy, and eye-catching images.\n\nBoost Your Visibility on Socials\n\nJust add your URL and get posts with professional designs scheduled a month in advance\n\nTry it for free today →\n\n⭐ Case Study: Chipotle often features their own meme-style shorts featuring menu items or subtly selling their product. \n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nWhat is TikTok’s recommended format?\n\nTikTok suggests recording your videos within the TikTok app on your phone in portrait mode for the 9:16 aspect ratio. They also recommend recording in 720p+ resolution and using good lighting. Since sound is so crucial on TikTok, consider using a microphone if you’re narrating. \n\nHow should I approach creating a TikTok video?\n\nExpress your brand’s peirsonality. TikTok’s culture welcomes a more informal style that prioritizes authenticity over polish. In keeping with that, brands that balance light humor with product promotion tend to thrive. Choose an approach that works for you and your audience. \n\nWhen’s the best time to post on TikTok?\n\nThe specific answer depends on whether you market globally or whether your business targets local consumers. The best time is when your customers are online. Many find Wednesday afternoons a good time to post. Regularly check your TikTok analytics to see whether you notice more views and engagement for videos posted at a specific time. After you discover your ideal time, maintain a consistent schedule.",
