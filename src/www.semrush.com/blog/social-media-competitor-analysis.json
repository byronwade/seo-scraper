  "content": "What Is a Social Media Competitor Analysis?\n\nA social media competitor analysis involves collecting and evaluating information about your competitors’ social media presences. Which helps you understand their strengths and weaknesses and reveals ways you can improve your own social media strategy.\n\nRunning a competitive analysis for social media enables you to:\n\nBenchmark your performance\nIdentify areas of opportunity and differentiation\nGet to know your target audience on a deeper level\nDiscover new trends or conversations you can cover\n\nWe recommend running a social media competitive analysis once a quarter to ensure you stay up to date with competitor and industry changes.\n\nHow to Do a Social Media Competitor Analysis\n\nFollow along for how to do a competitor social media analysis in six steps:\n\n1. Identify Your Competition\n\nBuild a list of your main competitors to inform your analysis.\n\nWhile you could focus on both direct competitors and indirect competitors (those that sell different products or services but may compete with you for market share), focus on your direct competitors.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause direct competitors are businesses most similar to your own. So you can get the most accurate information. \n\nUse Semrush’s Market Explorer to identify your main competitors and get insights into the competitive landscape.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nFirst, select “Find Competitors” and enter your domain.\n\nThen, click “Research a market.”\n\nThe “Overview” tab shows who you compete with online. And provides information about market share, audience size, and more.\n\nNext, scroll down to the “Growth Quadrant” widget. This breaks down you and your competitors into four basic categories: \n\nGame Changers: Emerging businesses with high growth potential\nLeaders: Businesses with both large audiences and high growth rates\nNiche Players: Businesses with small audiences and low growth rates\nEstablished Players: Established businesses with large audiences\n\nNote where each competitor stands and how their audience and traffic growth compare to yours. Then, create a list of your top five competitors.\n\nFind Social Media Competitors\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nSign up Now →\n2. Analyze Audiences and Platforms\n\nGetting to know your competitors' target audiences can reveal relevant segments you aren’t yet targeting. Which can inform changes you may need to make to reach and engage similar audiences.\n\nTo do this, you’ll want to compare characteristics like:\n\nDemographics: Age, gender, location, etc.\nSocioeconomics: Education level, income, household size, etc.\nPsychographics: Interests, values, goals, etc.\nBehaviors: Habits, preferences, pain points, etc.\n\nUse One2Target to look at your competition’s audiences.\n\nOpen the tool, enter at least one competitor’s domain, and click “Analyze.”\n\nThe “Demographics” tab shows a breakdown of their audience by age, gender, and location. \n\nClick the “Socioeconomics” tab to view data about the audience’s household size, household income, education level, and employment status.\n\nNow, click the “Behavior” tab to learn about the audience’s interests, device type usage, and most-used social media platforms.\n\nLooking at these insights, we can see that this audience:\n\nIs between 25 and 44 years of age, with a higher percentage identifying as male\nIs located in the U.S.\nLives in a household of three to four people\nIs working full-time with a lower income\nPrefers to use mobile devices\nPredominantly uses YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram\n\nUse this information to inform your messaging. And determine the best social media platforms to focus on. \n\nAnalyze Your Competitor’s Audience\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\n3. Find Industry Benchmarks\n\nThe next step is to identify industry benchmarks to see how you compare and gauge whether there’s room for improvement in your social media strategy. And help you set realistic goals.\n\nFirst, return to Market Explorer. And click on the “Benchmarking” tab. \n\nNext, click the “Organic Social” tab to see how much website traffic competitors drive from their social media marketing efforts.\n\nNote the amount of organic social traffic each of your five main competitors gets. And also consider the average.\n\nThen, compare those numbers to your own. You can find the exact amount of traffic you get from social media traffic in Google Analytics. \n\nNext, analyze your competitors’ engagement (likes, shares, etc.) to understand whether their content is resonating with their audiences. And might be worth replicating for your target audience.\n\nUse Semrush’s Social Tracker (part of Semrush Social) to see competitors' social media engagement rates. \n\nFirst, add the companies you want to analyze.\n\nThen, click “Start tracking companies.”\n\nIn the “Overview” tab, choose a platform you want to evaluate.\n\nThen, click the “Engagement” tab to view specific engagement metrics like reactions, comments, and shares. \n\nIn this case, you can also see top reactions. Which helps you understand audience sentiment.\n\nThe tool makes it easy to compare your own metrics to your competitors’ metrics all in one place. \n\nFinally, use a social listening tool to uncover conversations about your brand and your competitors. And see how sentiment across brands compares. \n\nUse the Media Monitoring app for this.\n\nAll you have to do is quickly set up tracking for your company as well as your competitors.\n\nFirst, go to the “Mentions” tab to see exactly what people are saying about each brand. And pay particularly close attention to those that come from social media.\n\nThen, go to the “Analysis” tab for every brand you’re targeting to get a sense of how sentiment differs for each.\n\n4. Analyze Your Competitors’ Content and Activity\n\nAnalyze the different types of social media content your competitors share as well as when they post it. \n\nTo gain insight into what works and what doesn’t.\n\nConsider whether their posts are informational, aspirational, entertaining, or promotional. And find out which of these categories drives the most engagement.\n\nAlso, look for how competitors use content across different channels. \n\nFor example, do they post the same story on TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram? Or, do they differentiate between channels? And what impact does this have on their social media performance? \n\nUse Semrush Social’s Social Tracker tool to find out. \n\nFor example, click “Facebook” to see the selected competitors' top-performing posts over a specific time period.\n\nNote what these posts have in common. For example: \n\nWhat format are they? \nWhat topic do they speak about? \nWhat copy have they used? \nDo they include a call to action (CTA)? Where does it direct the audience to?\nWhat hashtags do they use?\n\nYou can also explore how competitors use images and video on social media. \n\nDo they use product or lifestyle visuals? And which of these do people comment on the most?\n\nHere’s an example of a product shot from Lucky Goat Coffee that shows how their product is made:\n\nWhile there aren’t many comments, you can see that it’s received well over 100 likes. Which indicates it resonated with their audience. \n\nAnd it’s a good idea to look into how often competitors share content. So you can optimize your own posting schedule for better performance.\n\nUse Social Tracker to see your competition’s posting frequency and the days of the week people engage with their content.\n\nFor example, if you notice a competitor posts consistently throughout the week and consistently generates high engagement, this signals the audience is receptive to regular updates. \n\nUse the insights you gain from studying your rivals’ content and posting cadences to refine your own social media strategy.\n\n5. Do a SWOT Analysis \n\nSummarize your competitive analysis by conducting a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis.\n\nPro tip\n\nDownload our SWOT Analysis Template to get started.\n\nHere’s how to fill in each quadrant:\n\nStrengths\n\nIdentify the areas where you meet or exceed industry benchmarks. Or demonstrate a unique and compelling point of view. \n\nFor example, let’s say you have high impressions and reach due to the use of compelling video content, interactive social media challenges, and user-generated content (UGC).\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLook at your weak points.\n\nMaybe you notice your follower growth has stagnated over the past few months. Or, perhaps you struggle to generate authentic engagement on Instagram. \n\nOpportunities\n\nExplore opportunities to outperform your competitors.\n\nLet’s say the competition creates localized content and targets a small segment of your target audience. \n\nThis could lead you to explore the possibility of expansion and tailoring social campaigns to wider regions. Which could increase your market share.\n\nThreats\n\nAssess the threats you face.\n\nLike if a competitor regularly promotes deals and savings via social media to undercut your prices. Or, perhaps they spend heavily on social media advertising, but you don’t have the same budget.\n\n6. Refine Your Social Media Strategy\n\nUse insights from your analysis to adjust your social strategy. So you can work to improve your performance.\n\nNow that you’ve studied what your competitors are doing successfully, you could incorporate similar tactics into your social media strategy. And see whether they drive similar results.\n\nLike using platforms you don’t have a presence on but that resonate with your target audience. As long as you have the time and budget for it.\n\nYou can also use your analysis to uncover content gaps that neither you nor your competitors currently address.\n\nWhatever your findings are, use them to inform your future social media efforts. \n\n5 Social Media Competitor Analysis Tools\nSemrush Social\n\nThe Semrush Social app is a one-stop shop for running a social media competitive analysis.\n\nYou can track up to 20 competitors and gather insights into their engagement rates, follower and subscriber counts, publication frequency, post types, and more.\n\nThe app makes it easy to measure your own performance.
