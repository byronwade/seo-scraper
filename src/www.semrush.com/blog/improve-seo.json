  "content": "Here are 11 ways to improve SEO on your site:\n\n1. Review Existing Content Before Creating New Content\n\nGenerally, it’s a good idea to improve existing content before creating new content. \n\nBecause it allows you to:\n\nRemove unhelpful content that can harm your entire site’s SEO\nMaximize your content’s untapped potential\nAvoid overlapping content that can confuse Google and users\nReduce content creation costs\n\nHere are three tasks to prioritize:\n\nCheck Your Outdated Content\n\nFirst, find pages that haven’t been updated in the last 12+ months.\n\nThen, review the page to see if any of the content is outdated. Or just needs improvement.\n\nFor example, this post from our blog was first published in 2020:\n\nDuring our review, we identified changes that needed to be made, sent them to someone from our editing team, and then pushed them live.\n\nIf your updates are significant, your pages can get a “freshness boost” (almost like the page was just published.)\n\nPlus, because your content is objectively better, it should perform better in search.\n\nTo ensure that Google crawls and indexes your page (i.e., shows the new version in search results) as quickly as possible, use Google Search Console.\n\nJust enter your URL into the top field:\n\nAnd hit “Request Indexing”:\n\nThis will send Google crawlers to your webpage ASAP.\n\nTip\n\nCheck for crawlability issues (and other technical problems) on your site with Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nImprove High-Potential Pages\n\nHigh-potential pages are pages on your site that have some traction. But could use a boost to get them into the top three organic (unpaid) results.\n\nThe higher you rank, the more clicks you should get. As our State of Search 2023 research demonstrates:\n\nWhich is why ranking on the first page of Google isn’t always enough.\n\nYour first step is to find pages that have the most potential to crack the top three.\n\nIf you track your Google rankings with Semrush’s Position Tracking tool, filter for keywords in positions 4-10. \n\nLike this:\n\nTip\n\nIf you’re not using Position Tracking yet, you can access your average rankings in Google Search Console. You’ll need to export your data to apply a positions filter or scroll through results manually. \n\nThose are pages that you want to focus on improving. \n\nHow you improve those pages depends a lot on the existing content.\n\nBut in general, here are some ways that you can make quality content:\n\nOptimize your content to better meet search intent\nFormat your content so it’s easier to skim\nAdd more graphics, visuals, and illustrations\nAdd internal links to and from each page\nRemove fluff and focus on actionable strategies\nUse Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker\n\nImport your pages and their target keywords into Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker.\n\nThe tool will provide recommendations based on your top-ranking competitors and on-page SEO best practices.\n\nFor each page, you can get ideas relating to:\n\nStrategy: Suggests keywords you should target and helps identify keyword cannibalization issues \nSERP features: Highlights opportunities for earning a SERP feature, which can make your result more prominent in search results\nContent: Provides suggestions for your content based on the top 10 ranking pages\nSemantics: Reveals semantically related keywords that your content should also include\nBacklinks: Shows you specific domains you may want to earn backlinks from\nTechnical issues: Identifies technical SEO issues, including whether there is duplicate content\nUser experience: Integrate Google Analytics to better understand how users engage with the page\n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Structure Your Content for Featured Snippets\n\nFeatured snippets are prominent search results that contain an “instant answer” to the user’s query. Either in the form of a paragraph, list, table, or video.\n\nHere’s an example of a paragraph snippet:\n\nThe content inside of featured snippets is typically pulled from one of the top-ranking results.\n\nHere are a few quick tips that can help you snag one:\n\nUse Keyword Magic Tool to see which queries trigger featured snippets\nAnalyze the search engine results page (SERP) in Keyword Overview to get inspiration from the current snippet\nStructure your content with the appropriate HTML tags (H2s, H3s, etc.)\nApply BLUF (bottom line up front)—i.e., start with the most important point before going into detail\n3. Create New Content Based on Low-Competition Keywords\n\nMany sites struggle with SEO because they target keywords that are too competitive.\n\nHere’s how to find untapped keywords with little-to-no competition.\n\nTarget Question Keywords\n\nQuestion keywords are great for SEO for two main reasons:\n\nThey’re highly specific questions your target audience needs answers to\nThey’re generally not super competitive\n\nFor example, take the keyword “housing market.”\n\nThis keyword has a keyword difficulty (KD) of 66%:\n\nOn the other hand, a question keyword containing that same term has a KD of only 21%\n\nYou can easily find question keywords by checking out the “People also ask” sections of Google search results.\n\nJust search for a keyword. And scroll down until you see a set of “People also ask” questions.\n\nIf you click one of the results, it will expand the section and show more related questions.\n\nNote\n\nAccording to the Semrush Sensor, 57.72% of search results contained a “People also ask” section on December 13. So not every SERP you look at will have one.\n\nYou can also find questions in the Keyword Magic Tool. This allows you to collect useful keyword data, such as the search volume (average number of monthly searches).\n\nEnter a term related to your topic. Then, choose your country and click “Search.”\n\nThe tool provides a list of “Broad Match” keywords by default. These contain your starting keyword or a close variation.\n\nUse the “Questions” filter to focus on question keywords.\n\nFind Question Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nOptimize Around Long-Tail Keywords \n\nLong-tail keywords are highly specific terms that don’t get that many searches individually. But make up a high percentage of the total number of terms that people search for.\n\nIn general, newer sites or sites struggling with SEO should focus heavily on long-tail keywords. \n\nFor example, the keyword “hiking boots” sounds like a great fit for a new shoe store.\n\nAfter all, it gets 90,500 searches per month. And sounds like a keyword that a potential customer would search for.\n\nBut if you look at the keyword difficulty rating for that keyword, it’s out of reach for most small businesses.\n\nOn the other hand, a similar long-tail keyword (hiking boots with red laces) has a KD of only 29%:\n\nGranted, this long-tail version gets 98% fewer searches. But that’s the trade-off you’re making with long-tail terms.\n\nIn the Keyword Magic Tool, you can filter results based on the number of words, their KD score, and much more.\n\n4. Get Backlinks from Authoritative Sites\n\nGoogle treats certain kinds of backlinks (links from other sites) like votes of confidence, so link building can improve your SEO.\n\nEspecially if the links come from relevant, highly regarded sites.\n\nYou just have to familiarize yourself with Google’s spam policies. Or you could build harmful backlinks that put your search engine rankings at risk.\n\nHere are some of the link building strategies you can use:\n\nCreate highly shareable content: Publish link bait that’s specifically designed to generate backlinks from blogs and news sites in your niche\nTest out data-driven content: Data-driven content that tells a story is one of the best ways to build more links to your website. Whether through an original survey, public data, or internal data, create content around your results and share this with publishers. \nHelp a Reporter Out: A service that allows you to contribute quotes and insights to journalists looking for sources\n\nWith Semrush’s Link Building Tool, you can streamline the entire process.\n\nIt finds link building prospects based on your competitors and target keywords, helps you create and track outreach emails, and much more.\n\nBuild Backlinks Easily\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Insert Useful Images and Optimize Them Effectively\n\nImage optimization is usually considered an afterthought in terms of boosting SEO. However, optimized images can help drive traffic to your website when done correctly.\n\nBenefits of Using Visual Content\n\nBesides directly sending people to your site via Google Images, visual content can help enhance your text-based content.\n\nThat’s because high-quality visual content:\n\nBreaks up large walls of text \nAllows readers to understand written content better (and makes it easy to follow specific steps)\nProvides mini content assets that people can link to or share on social media\nHelps your content stand out from the competition (especially when using 100% unique graphics)\nTips for Optimizing Images\n\nHere are a few things that you should keep in mind when optimizing images on your site:\n\nImage file size and format: Use image formats designed for fast-loading (like WebP) \nDescriptions and names: Optimize alt tags, image file names, and image titles\nCopyright: Make sure the images can be legally used in your content\nRelevancy: Ensure the images are relevant to the content\nMobile-friendliness: View the images to ensure they appear correctly on mobile devices\nUnique: Try to limit the use of stock photos that have been used on lots of other sites already \nHow to Write Effective Alt Text\n\nImage alt text is something search engines like Google use to understand what an image is. It also improves accessibility for people using screen readers.\n\nHere’s how to write effective alt text:\n\nBe descriptive: Describe the image in as much detail as you can. Imagine you are describing it to someone who can't see it. In addition to being helpful for search engines, this also helps those who use screen readers better understand images.\nBe unique: Every image on each page should have unique alt text. \nBe relevant: Just like keywords in your content itself, you want to write natural-sounding alt text. This means you don’t need to stuff keywords into your alt text.\n6. Track SEO Metrics with Google Analytics\n\nTo see exactly how your SEO is improving, it’s important to know which metrics to pay attention to in Google Analytics. \n\n(Or another website analytics tool.)\n\nHere are some of the most important SEO metrics:\n\nMetric\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nOrganic search traffic\n\n\t\n\nThe number of unpaid website visits that come from search engines\n\n\n\n\nBounce rate\n\n\t\n\nThe percentage of visitors who leave your site without performing a desired action (e.g., visiting another page)\n\n\n\n\nAverage session duration\n\n\t\n\nHow long users typically spend on a page before leaving\n\n\n\n\nPages per session\n\n\t\n\nThe average number of pages viewed each time someone visits your site\n\nNote that there are no “good” or “bad” benchmarks here. These are more metrics to pay attention to as you make changes to your page.\n\nIf those metrics improve, your changes are likely having a positive impact on your site’s UX.\n\nTip\n\nBuild a website analytics dashboard to access all your most important metrics in one place.\n\n7. Make Sure Your Site Is Mobile-Friendly\n\nGoogle uses mobile-first indexing, which means it checks the mobile version of your site when deciding on rankings. \n\nSo, if you want to improve your SEO, it’s crucial to improve your mobile SEO. In other words, to deliver a great experience to users on mobile devices, like smartphones.\n\nGoogle Search Console can help you identify issues with the mobile experience.\n\nFor example, the Core Web Vitals report shows whether your site passes various mobile speed checks.\n\nAlternatively, find the most pressing issues with Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nIt performs over 140 checks, including many related to mobile SEO. And categorizes each issue as an error, warning, or notice.\n\nYou can even get advice on fixing each problem.\n\n8. Optimize Pages for Relevant Keywords\n\nWhile you should focus on creating content for users first, using keywords strategically can help you rank higher.\n\nHere are some of our top keyword optimization tips:\n\nUse Your Keyword in Your Title Tag and H1\n\nIt’s important that your primary keyword (the main search term you want to rank for) appears in your title tag. This is the title that can appear in search results, like this:\n\nThis should be very similar to your H1 tag (the main heading that appears on your page).\n\nIncorporate Keywords into Your Body Content\n\nGenerally, you should try to include the primary keyword in the first paragraph of body content. \n\nYou can also repeat this keyword, or use other relevant keywords, throughout your content. Where it’s natural to do so.\n\nFor example:\n\nUse Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant\n\nFor help incorporating keywords appropriately, use Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nSimply input your target keywords and start writing.\n\nThe tool will let you know, among other things:\n\nWhich keywords you’ve missed\nSemantic keywords to incorporate\nWhether you’ve overused a particular keyword\n\nIt will also provide a score for your overall SEO, readability, originality, and tone of voice.\n\nIf you get stuck, use the Smart Writer to rephrase or compose text.\n\nWrite Optimized Content\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\n9. Increase Page Load Speeds\n\nPage speed plays an important role in user experience. And is a confirmed Google ranking factor.\n\nTo see how fast your website is on desktop and mobile, enter your domain into Google’s PageSpeed Insights page.\n\nThis report will show you how quickly your site loads. And specific areas for improvement. \n\nFor example, we entered one of our blog posts into this tool.\n\nFortunately, we passed.\n\nBut as with almost any webpage, there were areas to improve.\n\nIf you’ve passed the test, it might not be worth investing the time and money into making further updates. It’ll all depend on the task, the resources available, and how competitive your industry is.\n\nTip\n\nYou can also check speed metrics in Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\n10. Target Local Searchers, Where Relevant\n\nIf your business (or branch) serves people in a nearby location, local SEO is super important. Perhaps even more important than “regular” SEO.\n\nIt helps your business appear when people search for relevant products, services, or amenities in their local area.\n\nFor example, it can help your Google Business Profile appear in the local pack. Which looks something like this:\n\nHere are some of our top recommendations for optimizing for local search:\n\nClaim your Google Business Profile and provide complete information\nPerform local keyword research and optimize your content accordingly\nEncourage customers to leave reviews on Google (and respond to reviews you get)\nEnsure your online directory citations (specifically, your name, address, and phone number) are consistent across the web\n\nTip\n\nWith Semrush’s Listing Management tool, you can easily submit your business information to top directories, track your visibility in Google Maps, and much more.\n\nStreamline Local SEO\n\nwith the Listing Management Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n11. Add Internal Links with Descriptive Anchor Text\n\nWhen done right, internal linking (i.e., linking between related pages on your site) can make a significant dent in your search engine rankings.\n\nInternal links send some authority from one page to another. \n\nThey also help Google and users to explore your site effectively. \n\nFor example, this internal link uses the anchor text “Technical SEO.” This helps search engines understand that the linked page (not the current page) is the most relevant result for this keyword.\n\nImprove Your SEO with Semrush\n\nSemrush has all the tools you need to improve your SEO.\n\nWe recommend starting with Site Audit. Because it identifies major errors that could hold your site’s rankings back. \n\nYou can then explore tools like:\n\nOn Page SEO Checker, which provides tailored recommendations for your pages\nLink Building Tool, which helps you build high-quality backlinks\nPosition Tracking, which lets you monitor results and spot ranking opportunities \n\nCreate your free account to get started.\n\nFind and Fix SEO Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
