  "content": "What Is Mobile SEO?\n\nMobile SEO is the process of optimizing your site so that it ranks higher in relevant search engine results on mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets, and delivers a better experience to mobile users.\n\nIt involves many of the same best practices as desktop SEO and plays a huge role in SEO as a whole.\n\nBut people are using mobile devices for search more than ever. So it’s crucial to prioritize the mobile experience.\n\nThis includes optimizing site design, content, and more with mobile in mind.\n\nEven the keywords you target may differ when optimizing for mobile site SEO.\n\nThe Importance of Mobile SEO\n\nOver 60% of organic search visits now come from mobile devices. \n\nAs mobile searches are on the rise, desktop searches continue to decrease:\n\nAnd according to Google, 56% of in-store shoppers used their smartphones to research products while they were in a store in the past week. \n\nSo even if your business has a lot of foot traffic, you’ll still miss out by ignoring mobile SEO. \n\nGoogle Uses Mobile-First Indexing\n\nGoogle now uses mobile-first indexing for every site on the web (apart from a few exceptions).\n\nThis means the mobile version of your site is the only one that counts toward rankings. \n\nTip\n\nCheck out our guides to learn more about crawling and indexing. And the Google index in particular.\n\nThat said, if you have separate URLs for desktop and mobile (e.g., “example.com” and “m.example.com”), Google will show the version that’s most appropriate to the user in search results.\n\nIf you haven’t configured your site for mobile yet, the next section explains how.\n\n3 Ways to Configure Your Website for Mobile\n\nThere are three options when it comes to making your site mobile-friendly: \n\nResponsive design\nDynamic serving\nSeparate URLs\n\nWe’ll start with the one that’s the easiest to use and maintain: responsive design.\n\n1. Responsive Design\n\nResponsive design allows you to serve the same page to both mobile and desktop users.\n\nThe server sends the same HTML code every time. CSS changes how the page renders based on the device. Like this:\n\nResponsive design is best for SEO because it:\n\nAllows users to share pages and link to your content with a single URL (rather than a separate “mobile” URL)\nReduces the chance of common mistakes that affect mobile sites\nIs less time-consuming to maintain than other methods\nDoesn’t require redirection for users to have a device-optimized view (which can reduce load time)\nSaves resources when Google crawls your site—Googlebot will only crawl the page once instead of multiple times\n\nIn fact, Google recommends using responsive design for your site.\n\nHere’s what it looks like on a real page:\n\nWhen using responsive design, you won’t need to deal with duplicate content issues or redirects that can slow down your site. \n\nInstead, you can create one responsive page for each piece of content.\n\nThis will save you a ton of time. \n\nPlus, you won’t have to worry about the design on responsive pages. The layout will always adjust to different devices accordingly.\n\nIt’s a win-win for mobile SEO.\n\n2. Dynamic Serving\n\nWith the dynamic serving method, different HTML is shown based on the user's device. But the URL doesn't change.\n\nEssentially, the content lives on the same URL. But the server provides different code to each device.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nBut Google prefers responsive design over dynamic serving.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nDynamic serving sites can show users the wrong version of a page. \n\nSo servers can accidentally show a desktop version to someone using a smartphone. Which can be frustrating and create a bad user experience.\n\nRead Google’s guide to dynamic serving to learn more about why they recommend using responsive web design instead.\n\n3. Separate URLs\n\nThe last option is to set up separate URLs for your desktop and mobile sites. So you’ll have a URL for the desktop version of your site and another URL for the mobile version.\n\nThe desktop URL looks like your typical URL: https://www.yoursite.com/\n\nWhile the mobile version usually replaces part of the URL with an “m” or the word “mobile”:\n\nhttps://m.yoursite.com/\n\nLike so:\n\nGoogle strongly recommends avoiding this tactic.\n\nWhen someone visits your site, the server will determine what device the visitor is using and direct them to either the mobile or desktop version of your site.\n\nThe issue with this solution is that it can take a lot of effort to manage. \n\nAnd because there are two versions of each page, you’ll need to add either rel=\"canonical\" tags or rel=\"alternate\" tags to their HTML codes. This lets Google know which is the primary version of each page.\n\nOn mobile pages: Set a rel=\"canonical\" tag pointing to the desktop version\nOn desktop pages: Set a rel=\"alternate\" tag pointing to the mobile version\n\nIf you don’t properly set these tags, Google may register desktop and mobile pages as duplicate content. Which can be confusing for Google when it’s trying to rank the correct page.\n\nYou can read more about the process in Google’s guide to separate URLs.\n\nIn short:\n\nIf you don’t set up the separate URLs properly, you could spend a lot of time fixing technical SEO issues you can avoid in the first place. And your Google rankings could suffer.\n\nHow to Check if Your Site Is Optimized for Mobile\n\nOnce you’ve set up the mobile version of your site, you can check how user-friendly it is with a variety of tools.\n\nLet’s start with Google Search Console (GSC).\n\nGoogle Search Console\n\nOnce you log into your GSC account, click “Mobile Usability” in the sidebar.\n\nThe tool will let you know if there are any mobile issues. Like if the text on a page is too small or if clickable elements are too close together.\n\nUse these insights to make changes to pages if needed.\n\nMobile-Friendly Test Tool\n\nAnother option is Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test tool. This tool allows you to check the mobile usability of individual pages.\n\nThere’s no need to log in with this one—all you need to do is paste your URL into the tool.\n\nThen, it will tell you if the URL you entered is mobile-friendly.\n\nAnd if not, it will let you know what areas to address.\n\nIf you need to learn more about an issue, hover over it and click on the question mark that appears.\n\nYou can learn more about the six types of mobile usability errors in Google’s Mobile Usability guide.\n\nSemrush Site Audit\n\nSemrush’s Site Audit tool checks your site for over 140 technical issues, including many related to mobile site SEO.\n\nAfter setting up, go to the “Issues” report to view a full list of errors, warnings, and notices.\n\nClick “Why and how to fix it” for advice on any issue. Or follow the blue links to see affected pages.\n\nMany of these issues affect SEO across device types. \n\nBut you can search for “mobile” to focus on mobile-specific issues. Such as those concerning AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) or viewport meta tags.\n\nAfter making improvements to your mobile SEO, rerun your audit. To ensure the issues have been fully resolved.\n\nFind Mobile SEO Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nPageSpeed Insights\n\nGoogle uses page experience as a ranking factor. And page experience includes how quickly your page loads.\n\nGoogle recommends that mobile sites load in under a second. Luckily, they offer a tool that checks for speed issues: PageSpeed Insights.\n\nPageSpeed Insights will assess your Core Web Vitals—i.e., a group of factors that affect page experience. \n\nThe Core Web Vitals are:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP). The amount of time it takes for the main content to load.\nFirst Input Delay (FID). The amount of time it takes for your website to respond to the first interaction (e.g., a click) from a user.\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS). How much your webpage shifts (or “moves down”) as more content (e.g., banners, images) loads.\n\nTo use PageSpeed Insights, enter your URL into the tool to get a full report.\n\nYour report will look like this:\n\nIt also gives you a Diagnostics report. That lists existing errors and code that might slow down your page load time.\n\nAnd an Opportunities report that gives you suggestions for increasing page speed.\n\nIncrease page speed to improve the user experience and show Google that you’re answering searchers’ needs—quickly.\n\n8 Mobile SEO Tips & Best Practices\n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, let’s discuss how to do mobile SEO. \n\nHere are eight essential tips and mobile SEO best practices:\n\n1. Create Mobile-Friendly Content\n\nWe’ve already discussed using resources like the Mobile-Friendly Test tool and PageSpeed Insights to check whether your pages are mobile-friendly.\n\nNow let’s cover how to create mobile-friendly content in the first place.\n\nUse Short Paragraphs\n\nKeep in mind that short paragraphs on desktop will appear much longer on mobile. To keep things readable, include no more than one idea per paragraph.\n\nThere’s no magic number of sentences to add per paragraph. But reducing the number of sentences in a paragraph can make it easier to read.\n\nIt’s also helpful to split up longer sentences into shorter ones. That way, mobile users can skim more easily.\n\nHere’s an example of a skimmable series of paragraphs on mobile:\n\nYou can further break up text with bulleted or numbered lists, tables, images, or videos.\n\nKeep Introductions Short\n\nFor the same reasons as above, it’s best to keep your introductions on the shorter side. \n\nUsers will only see a few paragraphs at most when they navigate to your site. So it’s your goal to hook them early. Get to your main point quickly. Elaborate as you go within the article. \n\nAnd if the article is centered around a question-based keyword, answer the question at the very beginning.\n\nFor example, if someone searched “how many ounces in a cup,” they would ideally find the answer in the first sentence.\n\nDon’t Be Afraid of White Space\n\nWhite space is one of the most valuable elements of web design. Including white space (or simply blank space) between text blocks, images, margins, and more improves the readability of any page.\n\nWhite space can improve comprehension by as much as 20%.\n\nTake a look at the difference between these two examples:\n\nThe additional space between headings and lines on the right makes it much easier to skim.\n\nAvoid Intrusive Popups\n\nGoogle has been penalizing “intrusive pop-ups” for years.\n\nAnd has specifically called out intrusive interstitial pop-ups, which cover the page’s main content as soon as the page loads.\n\nHere are examples of what not to do from Google:\n\nThe pop-up covers the main content in each of these examples.\n\nIt’s OK to use pop-ups to ask users to accept cookies or verify a user’s age. You can even include a traditional ad—so long as it uses a “reasonable” amount of screen space.\n\nLike this:\n\nSo if you’re going to use pop-ups, be sure to use them purposefully. And definitely don’t hide content on your page behind an ad.\n\n2. Use Structured Data on Your Mobile Website\n\nStructured data organizes content so that Google can more easily understand it. And schema markup is the code that represents this data in a way that search engines can understand.\n\nSchema markup can add things like recipe stars or reviews directly to your results in the SERPs. This turns your normal SERP snippets into rich snippets (or results with extra data displayed).\n\nThat can make your webpages stand out even more in the SERPs.\n\nHere’s what “how to” schema looks like on the SERP and in code:\n\nBut keep in mind that mobile searches appear in cards in a single column, like this:\n\nSay you want to add an FAQ section below your meta description using schema markup. The actual code might look like this:\n\nAnd this is how it looks in the search results on desktop:\n\nAnd here’s how it looks in mobile search results:\n\nYou’re working with a lot less space on mobile since there’s only one column of results. So the rich results stand out even more.\n\nSo if your goal is to get more mobile traffic, it’s helpful to implement structured data for the additional contrast and space on the SERP.\n\nTo learn how to add structured data to your site, read our in-depth guide.\n\n3. Target Voice Search-Friendly Keywords\n\nVoice search-friendly keyword lists are crucial for mobile SEO.\n\nIn fact, 65% of consumers between ages 25 and 49 use voice-enabled devices often.\n\nSo it’s a good idea to optimize your content for people using voice search on their phones—i.e., optimizing for conversational or semantic search.\n\nPeople using voice assistants to search typically speak more casually. To optimize for this, find question-based long-tail keywords.\n\nFor example, users might search “buy playstation 5” on a desktop. But when speaking, they may speak more casually and ask “where can I buy a playstation 5?”\n\nTo find more examples of long-tail keywords, go to the Keyword Magic Tool and search for one of your target keywords. \n\nWe looked up “best hikes.”\n\nThen, filter your list of keywords by “Questions.”\n\nYou’ll get a list of questions that people usually search for.\n\nFind Long-Tail Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Optimize Mobile Site Speed for Better UX\n\nPlenty of Google tools can help you see how your mobile site is faring. Like PageSpeed Insights and the Mobile-Friendly Test tool.\n\nHowever, you can also get detailed information on page performance directly in our Site Audit tool.\n\nStart by setting up an audit for your website.\n\nDouble check that your crawler settings are set to “SiteAuditBot-Mobile.” Then, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nOnce your audit is complete, navigate to the “Core Web Vitals” report found under Thematic Reports on the main page.\n\nHere, you’ll find an overview of your site’s Core Web Vitals score. As well as a list of suggested improvements for specific pages:\n\nWe recommend making these adjustments (along with any other technical adjustments you need to make on your site). Then, re-run your Site Audit to check that everything is in order.\n\nClick on the task you want to start with for a quick overview of what’s happening and how to fix it.\n\nHere’s one example:\n\nTo learn more, read our guide to measuring Core Web Vitals with Site Audit.\n\n5. Optimize Title Tags & Meta Descriptions for Mobile SERPs\n\nOptimizing your title tags and meta descriptions can improve the CTR (click-through rate) of your page.\n\nTo optimize your title tags for mobile search, keep your title tag between 50 and 60 characters.\n\nGoogle shortens or rewrites 99.9% of titles that are over 70 characters long. Titles at the recommended length are less likely to get shortened or rewritten.\n\nAdditional title tag tips include:\n\nTarget one primary keyword\nAvoid keyword stuffing \nMake each page’s title unique\nFront-load important information\n\nAs for meta descriptions:\n\nYour best bet is to keep your meta descriptions under 120 characters. \n\nAny longer, and they’re likely too long for mobile. (And Google will cut them off or rewrite them.) \n\nSo, keep them under 120 characters. This way, users will be able to read the whole thing whether they’re on desktop or mobile.\n\nAdditional meta description tips for mobile include:\n\nSummarize your page’s content\nUse unique descriptions for every page\nInclude your primary keyword\nAdd a call to action or a value proposition to encourage clicks\n6. Monitor Your Keyword Positions on Mobile\n\nKeep tabs on your mobile rankings by setting up a Position Tracking campaign.\n\nWhen setting up your campaign, be sure to select “Mobile” under the device category.\n\nEnter the keywords you’d like to track. Then click “Add keywords to campaign.”\n\nOnce setup is complete, go to the “Overview” tab.\n\nScroll down to see an overview of rankings for the keywords you chose:\n\nWant to compare mobile vs. desktop traffic for your tracked keywords? If you have a Semrush Business or Guru account, you can do so by visiting the “Devices & Locations” tab.\n\nAll you need to do is click “Add new target,” where you’ll add the same keywords you added earlier. Just be sure to choose “Desktop” instead of “Mobile” this time.\n\nNow, you can see the difference between desktop and mobile performance for the keywords you’re tracking:\n\nWant to keep an eye on your tracked keywords with minimal effort? Click on the bell icon at the top right of the screen to subscribe to a weekly email from your Position Tracking campaign. \n\nTrack Your Mobile Rankings\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n7. Review Your Competitors’ Mobile SEO Performance\n\nTo get a bird’s-eye view of your competitors’ mobile performance, head to a competitor research tool like Semrush’s Organic Research.\n\nHere, you can find your competitors’ best keywords, discover new organic competitors, and observe domains’ position changes.\n\nStart by entering the domain you want to review.\n\nThe main overview page will look like this. (Be sure to toggle the device to “Mobile” to get the correct data):\n\nScroll to see your competitor’s top keywords and position changes. And click into the corresponding reports for more detail:\n\nTo find related competitors, click on the “Competitors” tab at the top of the screen.\n\nYou’ll see a Competitive Positioning Map highlighting the top competitors. As well as a graph that covers shared keywords, competition level, and more of all competing sites:\n\nAnother way you can find opportunities is with the Keyword Gap tool.\n\nGo to the tool and enter your domain alongside the domains of up to four competitors. Then hit “Compare.”\n\nYou’ll get a report containing a short list of keywords that your competitors rank for (but you don’t).\n\nBelow that, you’ll also see a table with more keywords. The table has data about how you and your competitors are ranking for each keyword.\n\nAnalyze your competitors to find keyword opportunities you might have missed otherwise.\n\n8. Compare Desktop vs. Mobile Site SEO Performance\n\nYou can use Google Analytics to compare how your pages are performing on desktop vs. mobile.\n\nStart by logging into your Google Analytics account. Navigate to “Behavior” > “Site Content” > “Landing Pages” on the left-hand navigation bar.\n\nHere, you’ll see a list of all your pages. The best-performing pages are listed first. \n\nTo include mobile and desktop information for each page, click on “Add Segment” at the top of the page.\n\nSelect “Mobile Traffic” and “Tablet and Desktop Traffic” segments. Then click “Apply.”\n\nNow you’ll see mobile vs. desktop (and tablet) traffic for each page.\n\nYou can also tweak the date range for more specific results.\n\nCheck for any pages that are getting a lot of desktop traffic compared to mobile traffic. \n\nMost users search via mobile these days, so an influx of desktop traffic may indicate an issue with the mobile usability of the page in question.\n\nSupercharge Your Mobile SEO with Semrush\n\nMore users than ever are turning to mobile devices over desktop.
