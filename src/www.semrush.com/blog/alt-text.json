  "content": "What Is Alt Text?\n\nAlt text (alternative text) describes an image on a page. Alt text helps visually impaired people understand what the image shows, helps search engine bots understand image contents, and appears on a page when the image fails to load.\n\n(This is in contrast to an image caption. Which always appears on the page.)\n\nAlt text is typically added via the alt attribute in an image’s HTML code. \n\nLike so:\n\n<img src=“image-file-example.jpg” alt=“Alt text goes here”>\n\nThat’s why it’s sometimes known as the “alt attribute” or “alt tag.”\n\nMost content management systems (CMSs) have a dedicated field for alt text. So you don’t need to edit the HTML directly.\n\nHere’s an example from WordPress:\n\nYou can also use image alt text on social media platforms like Twitter. \n\nHere’s an example from Dogs Trust:\n\nWhy Is Alt Text Important?\n\nAlt text is important because it makes images more accessible to people and search engines. Even when they cannot be displayed.\n\nIf you don’t provide appropriate alt text, people using screen readers can’t get information from images. This unfairly excludes users with visual impairments. Which can harm your brand reputation, traffic, and conversion rate.\n\nPlus, web accessibility is good for SEO.\n\nGoogle and other search engines use alt text to determine what images portray (or link to). This can enhance their understanding of your content and therefore lead to higher rankings.\n\nAlt text is particularly helpful for image SEO—i.e., ranking high in Google Images and other image results. \n\nThis type of exposure can drive valuable traffic to your site.\n\nFor example, the search engine results page (SERP) for “corgi puppies” is dominated by images. Which link through to the owners’ sites.\n\nMany of these images use the keyword “corgi puppy” or “corgi puppies” in their alt text.\n\nBecause alt text is important in on-page optimization, it’s sometimes referred to as “SEO alt text.”\n\nGet a team account\n\nTo save on Semrush subscription\n\nLearn more →\nHow to Write Alt Text (Best Practices)\n\nLearn how to write alt text that improves your site’s accessibility and SEO.\n\nWe’ve rounded up three alt text best practices to help you write perfect alt text:\n\n1. Add Alt Text to the Right Kinds of Images\n\nDon’t write alt text for purely decorative images (like the one below). These descriptions can cause distraction and confusion for users with visual impairments, rather than adding useful context.\n\nInstead, provide a null (empty) alt attribute. Like so:\n\n✅ <img src=\"decorative-image-title.jpg\" alt=\"”>\n\nThis tells screen readers to ignore the image.\n\nIf you leave out the alt attribute altogether (as below), assistive technologies may read out the image file name instead. Creating a poor user experience.\n\n❌ <img src=\"decorative-image-title.jpg\">\n\nDo write alt text for all other images—images that provide additional meaning to the reader.\n\nFor example:\n\nImages of useful text (e.g., screenshots of social media posts)\nIcons that denote functionality (e.g., shopping cart icons)\nPhotos that provide supplementary information (e.g., a smartphone size comparison)\nCharts that illustrate otherwise unmentioned data\nGraphics that demonstrate processes (e.g., how to hold chopsticks)\n\nTip: If you draft content in Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant, the tool will remind you to add image alt text. It also provides readability, SEO, originality, and tone of voice suggestions.\n\nCreate SEO-Friendly Content\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Be Descriptive Yet Concise\n\nAlt text should be “the most concise description possible of the image’s purpose,” according to the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). \n\nWhat’s important about an image depends on context. So take the surrounding content and audience into account when writing alt text.\n\nConsider the photo below. The alt text “Woman doing yoga” would be appropriate in many contexts. \n\nBut in a workout guide, a detailed description of the woman’s pose could be necessary.\n\nWhen writing alt text, think about how you’d describe an image to someone in a phone conversation.\n\nDon’t include the following details in your alt text:\n\nPhoto credits and copyright information—include in the image caption instead\nRedundant phrases like “image of” or “photo of” (unless the format is particularly relevant)\nInformation that all your readers need—add this to the caption or body content instead\nInformation that’s already provided via the image caption or body content\n\nTip: Some people recommend sticking to a maximum of 125 characters when writing alt text for images. That’s because many assistive technologies stop reading alt text at 125 characters. But it’s not a strict limit. If you need to write much more, see the WAI’s advice on complex images.\n\n3. Include a Keyword\n\nAdding relevant keywords to alt text can help your images rank in Google image results. \n\nFor example, this alt text tells Google that our marketing funnel guide contains a helpful marketing funnel illustration:\n\nMeaning it would be a relevant Google image result for queries related to marketing funnels.\n\nTo understand which keywords to include in alt text, you’ll need to do some keyword research. \n\nTry conducting keyword research with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nJust enter a keyword related to your image then click “Search.”\n\nGo to “Advanced filters” then “SERP Features.” \n\nThen check “Image” and “Image pack” before clicking “Apply.”\n\nThe tool will show keywords that contain your starting keyword (or a variation) and generate image results. \n\nThese words and phrases are great candidates for your image’s SEO alt text. As long as the image will meet searchers’ needs.\n\nFind Keywords That Trigger Image Results\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nAlt Text Examples\n\nLet’s look at three alt text examples that follow best practices.\n\nExample 1: NASA\n\nThis blog post is about a photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA provides highly descriptive alt text to ensure users with visual impairments can understand what’s in the photo.\n\nAlt text: Spiral galaxy with bright core, spiral arms, and a slight glow surrounds it. Below, strands made of bright blue patches trail down like tentacles. Galaxy is just touched by a second, faint galaxy on left.\n\nExample 2: Bureau of Internet Accessibility\n\nThe Bureau of Internet Accessibility homepage features logos of the brands it’s worked with.\n\nWhen users don’t have access to these images, the alt tags provide a substitute.\n\nExample 3: The Guardian\n\nIn this product review, The Guardian uses alt attributes and image captions to give readers and search engines the information they need.\n\nAlt text: The back of the Pixel 7 Pro showing the aluminium camera bar.\nImage caption: The camera bar design still divides opinion but there is no doubt it stands out against the crowd. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nNotice that the alt text acts as a replacement for the image. Whereas the caption provides extra information, such as the photo credit.\n\nHow to Find & Fix Missing Alt Text\n\nTo check if there’s missing alt text for images on your site, use Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nEnter your domain and click “Start Audit.” \n\nThen follow the prompts to configure the tool.\n\nOnce the audit is ready, click on the “Issues” tab.\n\nYou’ll see a list of errors, warnings, and notices.\n\nSearch for “alt attributes.” Then see if you have the “# images don’t have alt attributes” warning.\n\nIf you do, click the “# images” link to see affected URLs.\n\nClick the “open link” icon beside each page title to view any page or image.\n\nFound an image that doesn’t need alt text? Click the eye icon to hide the warning. \n\nOr use the filters, check boxes, and “Hide selected” button to remove warnings in bulk.\n\nReady to work on your alt text? Use the check boxes and “Send to…” button to create tasks in the Semrush CRM, Trello, or Zapier. (You may need to set up the corresponding integration first.)\n\nThen add missing alt text via your CMS.\n\nMake sure to rerun your Site Audit afterward. Just click on the gear button and hit “Rerun campaign.” And watch your image alt text warnings disappear.\n\nFind Missing Alt Text\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
