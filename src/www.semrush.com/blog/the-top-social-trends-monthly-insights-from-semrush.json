Keep it simple, e.g.,\n“You need new shoes.”\n“You need a new bag..”\n“You need a babysitter.”\n\nAdapt the message to the product or service you offer.\n\nThen, record the below clip in one continuous shot—with the camera fixed over the table.\n\nPour some water on the table.\nPut the napkin on the spilled water.\nKeep recording as the message appears.\n\nPro tip: Your video is more likely to get noticed if you accessorize your table aesthetically. Try to keep your product on the table if possible, or else have a potted plant or some flowers.\n\nExample post\n\nResources\n\nPaper napkin, pen, table (white preferred). \n\n#2 Introduce yourself ⭐️\n\nConcept\n\nA video clip showing someone bumping into you. You are initially angry, then introduce yourself politely.\n\nUse it to\n\nHumorously introduce yourself.\n\nSteps for adapting\n\nAdapting requires a friend with a camera. Tell the friend to keep recording while walking towards you.\n\nWalk into the camera—fake bump the friend.\nThreaten the friend: “Bump into me one more time, and I’ll show you exactly who I am.”\nGet the friend to touch you.\nReach out, shake hands, and politely introduce yourself and your business.\nEnd by saying, “Have a nice day.”\n\nPro tip: Try and record where your business operates— a mall, shopping strip, market, or the neighborhood where you usually offer services. Remember to mention the location in the video to make it more memorable.\n\nExample post\n\nResources\n\nFriend with a phone.\n\n#3 Dancing trend⭐️\n\nConcept\n\nA video clip showing you or your team members dancing funnily. You can caption the video with an upcoming event or product launch.\n\nUse it to\n\nEnthusiastically promote your event/product.\n\nSteps for adapting\n\nRecord yourself or any team member dancing in a funny/cool way to some catchy music.\n\nCaption the video with a statement like\n“Expo tomorrow!”\n\n“25% discount on XYZ item.”\n“New <product name> has arrived.”\n\nPro tip: Your video is more likely to get noticed if your outfit is unique and you do some editing, like two of yourself dancing or you dancing over an existing dance clip.\n\nExample post \n\nResources\n\nMusic - https://www.instagram.com/reel/DALyKN1IpU0/\n\nDance tutorial - https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAGhBozBVTu/\n\n#4 I am the owner ⭐️\n\nConcept\n\nA video clip shows someone asking for free service, claiming they know the owner. You say you are the owner—shocking them.\n\nUse it to\n\nShow off your store/display or as innovative behind-the-scenes content\n\nSteps for adapting\nStart with a shot of yourself checking out an item and stating the price.\nShot of a friend/ yourself in different clothes saying they know the owner.\nZoom in on your face—smile—“I am the owner.”\nZoom in on the customer, who should have a shocked expression.\n\nPro tip: In the first shot, you can show your shop, display it in a zoomed-out shot, and then pan into you checking out the item.\n\nExample post\n\nResources\n\nA friend, although you can shoot it yourself with different clothes on and then edit the shots together.\n\n#5 Commenting on others ⭐️\n\nConcept\n\nA video clip of you commenting on another video.\n\nUse it to\n\nShow off your expertise in a relatable and funny way.\n\nSteps for adapting\nFind a video that shows a mistake/trend in your niche.\nRecord yourself commenting on it. \nEdit it so your video plays in the corner of the original video.\n\nPro tip: Remember to shoot your video for the same time length as the original video. Match expressions with what's happening in the video. If you want to explain/educate, you can always record yourself talking for longer and use the pause effect on the other video.\n\nExample post\n\nResources\n\nTutorial on how to make and edit a commentary video.\n\nLearnings for the Month\n#Free downloads increase engagement (and grow mailing lists).\n\nAlongside entertaining and informational posts, consider educating your audience too. Prepare little booklets of informational content and share the link for a free download—but remember to redirect your customers to an email capture gateway. Give them access to the download via emails so you can continue nurturing leads for conversion.\n\nFor example, we recently shared the Anatomy of a Perfect Blog Post as a gated downloadable, resulting in 200 reposts and nearly 1000 new email captures!\n\n#Instagram carousels can still be very effective if you know how to use them.\n\nIt can feel like Reels have taken over Instagram, but static posts still have their place. Use your carousel to share a story or humorous message your audience can relate to and watch your engagement soar.\n\nFor example, our Instagram carousel post received thousands of likes and shares. It involved a mean shooting star and marketing budget woes—something that resonates deeply with our audience. Feel free to reuse the graphics with your messaging!\n\n#Current event memes are always popular.\n\nMemes can seem frivolous but are popular among both young and older audiences. Try and find memes related to current events and adapt them to your context. Such content is quick to create and always popular.\n\nFor example, our Olympic meme was a huge hit on Instagram. Check out the comments—we love our audience!\n\nOur Moo Deng Meme went viral on LinkedIn. Yes, we compared a pygmy hippo to the over-enthusiastic marketing professional.\n\nWe even had the LinkedIn team comment on our post!\n\nWondering how you can stay on top of trends while running a stressful business?

Enter your domain name or business description for a customized content plan with all the latest trends!\n\n⭐️Supercharge Your Social Media with Social Content AI⭐️\n\nInput your website or description for dozens of social media ideas customized to your business.\nIdeas are organized by themes for strategic content planning.\nAutomatically generate ready-to-publish posts, images, videos, and designs.\nUse the same idea to generate multiple posts adapted for different social media platforms.\nEasily edit and tweak or re-design any post if you want to.\nTrends for September ‘24\nSocial media trends for September 2024\n#1 Crying girl meme ⭐️\nConcept\n\nA video clip showing a crying girl who starts laughing when she sees your product.\n\nUse it to\n\nShow off your product in a relatable and funny way.\n\nSteps for adapting\n\nAdapting requires some skillful video editing.\n\nStart with a shot of the crying girl.\nInsert footage of yourself looking at the camera as if you've just noticed the crying girl.\nZoom in on the face of the crying girl.\nInsert footage of yourself showing your product to the camera.\nShow the girl's surprised and laughing expression.\n\nPro tip: Your video is more likely to get noticed if your outfit or accessories are unique and your product is showcased glamorously.\n\nExample post\nResources\n\nTake the original crying girl clip from TikTok and edit it with your own recording.\n\n#2 Annoying salesman ⭐️⭐️\nConcept\n\nA stranger asks you (the business owner) about what you do. You respond by chasing them down, asking for contact details, and trying to make a sale.\n\nUse it to\n\nPoke fun at your hustle spirit (humble brag ;)) or at an industry stereotype.\n\nSteps for adapting\nYou can take the original video, but record your voice and dialog and edit the subtitles. OR \nRecord yourself getting out of the car and chasing the camera, asking questions.\n\nPro tip: Your video will get more attention if you pretend to slip and almost fall like the original guy.\n\nExample post \nResources\n\nTake the original clip from Instagram. Remember to credit the original creator!\n\n#3 Sales teleporter ⭐️⭐️ \nConcept\n\nYou are standing outside your storefront waving enthusiastically as a customer drives by. The camera pans, and you are now in the back seat of the car, smiling creepily at the customer and encouraging them to buy your product. \n\nUse it to\n\nPoke fun at your hustle spirit or promote a special discount or giveaway.\n\nSteps for adapting\n\nThis requires some shooting effort.\n\nRecord yourself waving outside your store, a busy shopping center, or an event venue. Ask someone to record you from within a moving car.\nRecord yourself sitting in the back seat of the same car. Use a camera in the front seat for recording.\n\nPro tip: To create a creepy/horror video mood, act like you are threatening the driver in the last shot. You could also wear a creepy costume or enthusiastically promote your product.\n\nExample post\n#4 Board & paper ⭐️⭐️⭐️\nConcept\n\nUse a board and pen to share tips. Key information is hidden, and you uncover it in the video.\n\nUse it to\n\nEducate your audience with short tips that they can remember and implement.\n\nSteps for adapting\n\nPrepare the board and record yourself revealing key information. Try to keep the written content short and neat.\n\nExample post\nResources\n\nYou will need a whiteboard, marker, and stickers or labels to hide some parts of your message.\n\nPro tip: Your video will attract more attention if you use a bigger board, neater handwriting, and colorful labels/stickers.\n\n#5 Dangerous situation ⭐️⭐️\nConcept\n\nA special-effect video that shows you promoting your product or sharing a safety tip around a dangerous situation like a reversing car or a slowly oncoming bus.\n\nUse it to\n\nEducate your audience memorably or show your commitment to your product in a funny way.\n\nSteps for adapting\n\nThis requires some video-editing skills and knowledge.\n\nRecord yourself talking about your product with the product in your hand. Use a blank screen and background and record from a slight distance.\nTake just your clip and overlay it over another video of a car reversing or other dangerous situation.\n\nPro tip: You can record the car reversing or bus video outside your storefront if you have a physical store.\n\nExample post\nResources\n\nFree video clip - moving car\nFree video clip - car crossing road\nFree video clip - oncoming train\n\n#6 Dancing ⭐️⭐️⭐️\nConcept\n\nDance and show different product variations or product items to catchy music.\n\nUse it to\n\nPromote your products, showcase a new release, or humble brag about the different roles you play while running your business (manager, cleaner, cook, etc.).\n\nSteps for adapting\n\nRecord the same dance movement with different clothes in the same spot.\n\nJoin the different clips so transitions look seamless.\n\nPro tip: Record with a tripod for maximum stability. Start at the exact same spot in the exact same pose for a smooth final video.\n\nExample post\n#7 Product Giveaways ⭐️⭐️\nConcept\n\nYou meet a stranger and give away your product if they complete a challenge.\n\nUse it to\n\nShowcase your products or promote a discount, voucher, etc.\n\nSteps for adapting\nGet a friend/colleague to act like a stranger, introduce yourself, and ask them to perform the task.\nThe task should be related to or even using your product.\nShoot the video with your hand camera so it looks natural.\n\nPro tip: Share some educational tips about using your product or on the subject. Keep the video shorter than 90 seconds for maximum impact.\n\nExample post\n\nFAQ of the month\n\nCan I repurpose video content between Instagram Reels and TikTok?\n\nAbsolutely! Reach a wider audience by sharing your videos on both platforms.\n\nPro Tip: Aim for higher quality when creating videos for Instagram, then adapt them for TikTok.

We know digital marketers struggle with wearing many hats in their roles, and acknowledging this reality in a comical way really hit the mark with our audience.\n\n#Emojis are always popular.\n\nOur #WorldEmojiDay posts went down a treat with our audience, getting over 5000+ reactions and 200,000 impressions on LinkedIn and Instagram.\n\n\t\n\t\n\nOne person commented: \n\nThe key takeaway? Keep a calendar of important ‘National Days’ that align with your brand and target audience—and consistently celebrate those days with engaging social content. These are great opportunities to connect even better with your followers! \n\n#Freebies don't have to be physical products.\n\nBrands think they have to give away physical products to drive engagement. But sometimes, solving a problem for free or giving away ideas works just as well!\n\nWhen we launched our Social Content AI, we released an interactive post that promised to give 30+ custom social media marketing ideas to anyone who asked.\n\nWe responded to every comment, skyrocketing engagement on LinkedIn.\n\nAn example list of ideas we shared\n\nSocial Content AI can generate personalized content ideas and posts for your brand, too!\n\nCompelling social copy and captions \nUnique images and designs\nVideos and memes\n\nStress Free Social Media Management\n\nWith Social Content AI\n\nTry it Now →",
