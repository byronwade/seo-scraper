  "content": "It’s surprisingly easy for awesome content to generate few or no returns.\n\nFor a blog article, social media post, podcast, or any other type of content to perform well, it must reach the right people. Only then can it drive high-value traffic, boost conversion rates, and help you grow.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn about content amplification: what it is, how it gets the right eyes on your site, and how to get started.\n\nWhat Is Content Amplification?\n\nContent amplification is the process of using online platforms and other channels to reach a larger or more targeted audience with your content.\n\nThe process involves multiple strategies and techniques, all with the goal of generating web traffic. Typical amplification tactics include online advertising, influencer partnerships, email marketing, and guest posting.\n\nFor example, in this ActiveCampaign marketing email, the brand promotes a selection of recent blog, event, and case study content:\n\nAfter creating helpful content, the brand uses email to share it with people who might have missed it on their website. \n\nBy segmenting its audience, ActiveCampaign can ensure subscribers only see content that’s relevant to them. That way, it’s more likely to engage readers and generate traffic to the ActiveCampaign website.\n\nWhy You Should Use Content Amplification\n\nThere’s more to content amplification than showing off your hard work. \n\nWhen you amplify high-quality work effectively, you can build brand awareness, solidify relationships, and squeeze more from your content budget.\n\nGrow Your Audience\n\nThe more eyes on your content, the more brand awareness and familiarity you’ll build. \n\nPromote with channels like paid ads and search engine optimization (SEO) for the best chance of finding potential customers.\n\nFor example, content management system (CMS) provider Contensis uses promoted posts to amplify its content strategy guide:\n\nPaid ads are ideal for precise targeting and fast results, while SEO can be super cost-effective over longer periods.\n\nStay Familiar with Existing Customers\n\nRegular content promotion keeps you in view of existing customers and followers. It reminds them you’re active, knowledgeable, and keen to deliver value beyond paid products and services.\n\nOrganic social media activity and email newsletters will help you maintain these relationships. Use them to reach people who know your brand but rarely visit your website.\n\nExtend Content Lifespans\n\nYou can use all amplification techniques to make your content work harder for longer. They’ll help you get bigger returns on your content marketing investments.\n\nSay you build a library of case study content. You could amplify each success story around relevant industry events to generate new interest. You’ll have spent the same time and budget on the content creation process. But now you’re getting more views over a longer period.\n\nHow to Create a Content Amplification Strategy\n\nEvery content marketing strategy should include a promotion campaign. It’s how you'll make sure people see your content after you worked so hard to create it.\n\nChoosing your amplification tactics before the content creation process helps you use your time effectively. With the right preparation, you won’t need to pause after signoff and lose momentum.\n\nFor example, if you’ll use influencer marketing to extend your content’s reach, form the necessary relationships in advance. You might create a pool of relevant influencers within niche communities, ready to call on when a new piece is live.\n\nEven better, try getting influencer contacts involved at the content creation stage. If they agree to provide an idea or commentary for a blog post, they’ll be more enthusiastic about promoting the work once it’s live.\n\nEntertainment website IGN enriched an article using comments from art director Ovidio Cartagena, who then shared the piece on Twitter:\n\nWhile every content amplification strategy is unique in detail, having a general roadmap will help you remember the most important actions. You can break the process down into six main steps.\n\nStep 1: Talk to Your Customers\n\nCustomer interviews will help you select the most effective amplification channels.\n\nYou can also gain helpful feedback by sending surveys to people on your email list.\n\nWhichever approach you choose, aim to speak with a cross-section of buyers. Use the answers to refine your amplification and broader lead-generation tactics.\n\nSay you learn that your most valuable customers (i.e., those with outstanding customer lifetime values, or CLVs) prefer LinkedIn to Twitter. You’d then know to promote content around high-ticket items in LinkedIn posts rather than tweets.\n\nQuestions you could ask in a survey or interview include:\n\nWhich social media platforms do you use most?\nDo you read emails from brands?\nAt what times are you most active online?\nDo you trust influencer recommendations?\nHow often do you pay attention to search engine advertisements?\n\nCustomer behaviors evolve, so make a point of collecting data periodically. You might find that social media channel preferences change, for example.\n\nStep 2: Prioritize Your Content Inventory\n\nContent audits help you quickly identify the best content for amplification. \n\nThey show you which pieces perform well and which don’t. So you know what’s most likely to resonate with your audience.\n\nSemrush’s ImpactHero tool uses real-time data from your website to help you do just that. \n\nUse its reports to build an amplification priority list:\n\nThe lowest-performing content. Revisit the content itself before trying to get more attention. Your messaging or format may have missed the mark.\nMid-performing pages. It’s had some engagement but needs a boost. Ensure the content’s still relevant before promoting it through appropriate channels.\nTop-performing content. Keep the momentum going. Ensure your most successful content keeps reaching new audiences by promoting it regularly.\nHow to Use ImpactHero:\n\nEnter your domain into the tool.\n\nThen, add the tag to Google Tag Manager or add the HTML code to every page you’d like to track through the tool.\n\nData takes about a day to show within the tool.\n\nNow, you can set your content scope (or URLs to be analyzed).\n\nIn the “Overview” report, you’ll see “Content Performance Insights” based on the impact of your content (e.g., monetary value or number of leads).\n\nAnd in the “Analytics” report, you can break down your content by traffic, impact, engagement, conversions, etc. So you can analyze which content is performing best for your business.\n\nAnd in the “Explorer” report, you can see useful data on each analyzed URL.\n\nStep 3: Get Creative with Your Messaging\n\nMatch your message to your channels when repurposing content, as different formats suit different audiences and environments.\n\nFor example, snappy, insightful threads (with a content link in the final post) work well on Twitter. They’re much less effective on Instagram.\n\nBut the general goal is consistent: you need to entice clicks by grabbing attention and building intrigue.\n\nIn this recent tweet, we attracted followers by highlighting some of our content’s key takeaways before sharing a link:\n\nWe covered the same topic on Instagram but went with a lighter tone and used the carousel feature to appeal to the platform’s more visual audience:\n\nAnother way to turn heads is with a hook. In this Facebook ad, Nom Nom leads with a relatable customer quote over an intriguing product image:\n\nThe post takes people back to landing page content to learn more about Nom Nom’s product. It generated more than 149 shares, helping the brand grow its audience. \n\nStep 4: Decide on a Budget\n\nSet a budget to keep paid promotion cost-effective.\n\nOnly you will know what’s affordable or justifiable for your business. But it’s always sensible to start small. \n\nTest the waters with a few low-cost promotions on the channel most relevant to the biggest section of your audience. You’ll get a feel for what works and doesn’t so you can refine your approach before spending more.\n\nChoose the content you promote carefully. Paid methods like social media and search engine ads provide fast results, making them ideal for amplifying time-sensitive content, like year-based lists or topical news articles.\n\nThey also work well for short-term product offers (think flash sales) and event-based content, as these come with definitive deadlines.\n\nThe exact costs of paid promotion depend on:\n\nThe platform. Facebook ads are often cheaper than Instagram ads, for example. \nWhat you’re promoting. Targeting broad keywords (e.g., “bakery”) almost always costs more than targeting specific ones (e.g., “vegan bakery in Flagstaff”).\nAmplification intensity. How often do you want your ads to show? And how many people are you aiming to reach?\n\nWith those factors in mind, develop a budget that aligns with organizational goals and restrictions (e.g., is there money left in the existing marketing pot, or will you need approval to access more?). Then make a plan for allocating those resources.\n\nCPC is an ad revenue model by which a publisher charges an advertiser every time a user clicks their ad. Look at the average CPCs for search and social to understand how much it costs to amplify content on these channels.\n\nThis WordStream chart shows what you can expect to pay (per click) for search engine ads in different industries: \n\nAnd here are average CPCs for the main social media platforms:\n\nThese figures (from 2022 data) will inevitably fluctuate, but the hierarchy still shows which platforms are the cheapest and most expensive.\n\nJust remember it’s all relative. For example, you may justify paying extra for LinkedIn if the B2B buyers you’ll reach typically spend more.\n\nStep 5: Map Your Influencer Network\n\nCarefully curate your network of contacts before you need it—influencer marketing only works if you collaborate with the right people.\n\nAccording to one Matter survey, more consumers trust recommendations from friends, family and influencers (61%) than branded social content (38%).\n\nThe Matter study reported that consumers were more likely to trust influencers with “relatable” and “expert” personalities than celebrity figures. So prioritize authenticity, relevance, and knowledge over follower count when considering partners.\n\nBalance is important, though. Anyone you work with should have enough of a following to boost your organic reach.\n\nStart by listing high-profile contacts from your industry. It could be the leader of a more established company from your field or a partner who’s active (and popular) on a relevant social platform.\n\nOnline communities help, too. You can use social media or dedicated networks. \n\nStart by joining or creating relevant groups and pages on LinkedIn, YouTube, and other social platforms. Post your content, then track who shares it and drives the most engagement. Next time you want help amplifying content, target these users directly.\n\nFor a more direct approach, use the Influencer Analytics app. It has an easily searchable database of over 27 million contacts.\n\nClick any influencer’s profile to get insight into their average number of likes, the audience’s age and gender, and more.\n\nDiscover Influencer Analytics\n\nthe All-in-One Influencer Marketing Platform\n\nStart Free Trial →\nStep 6: Metrics and Measurement\n\nPlan how you’ll measure success. You can use what you learn to optimize future marketing campaigns for bigger results.\n\nBecause your goal is to boost the performance of existing content, you can use some of the same key performance indicators (KPI) you’d track for a new campaign.\n\nThe main metric groups to focus on are:\n\nUser behavior. Page views, new users, average time on page, and traffic sources all help you gauge the short-term impact of your amplification efforts.\nEngagement. You want people to engage with your content, not just see it. Track upvotes, likes, shares, comments, and mentions to check that your content is relevant and valuable.\nCompany revenue. What long-term impact does your strategy have? Measure this using conversions, new leads generated, cost per acquisition (CPA) and general content marketing return on investment (ROI).\n\nLearn about these metrics and where to find them (Semrush and Google Analytics are great starting points) in our guide to measuring content performance.\n\n5 Content Amplification Channels to Drive Traffic\n\nA solid amplification strategy comprises multiple channels. Here are a few to get you started, with examples for inspiration:\n\n1. Organic Social\n\nOrganic social refers to unpaid activity on social media platforms, like Instagram and LinkedIn.\n\nSocial media amplification works well because you can share content in various formats. And reach large, highly targeted audiences.\n\nPlus, other users can interact with your posts and amplify them further.\n\nFor example, Semrush shared the image below on X (formerly Twitter). And more than 400 users reposted it for their own followers to see.\n\nIn total, it got over 5.7K views.\n\nHere are some tips for social amplification:\n\nProvide value directly within your post—not just via a linked page\nTag users in your posts, where appropriate (e.g., people quoted in your content)\nUse relevant and popular hashtags\nMaintain a regular posting schedule\nPost at your audience’s most active times of day\nUse a variety of social content formats (videos, images, etc.)\n\nYou can streamline social media management with Semrush Social.\n\nThe Social Poster tool allows you to schedule posts on X, Facebook, Instagram Business, LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, and Pinterest.\n\nYou can also track social media metrics, analyze your competitors’ posts, and much more.\n\nStreamline Social Media Management\n\nwith Semrush Social\n\nSign up Now →\n2. Paid Social\n\nPaid social refers to social media advertising—i.e., paying to get your content seen on social media platforms.\n\nThis is a great way to supplement organic reach while you’re growing your following. Or tap into new audience segments.\n\nLet’s explore Facebook Ads (one of the best channels for B2C marketers) and LinkedIn Ads (one of the best channels for B2B marketers):\n\nFacebook Ads\n\nFacebook Ads allows you to target incredibly specific groups among its nearly 3 billion users. That’s useful given how broad the channel’s reach is–it attracts a healthy mix of businesses and consumers of all ages.\n\nHere’s what the targeting process looks like on Facebook Ads:\n\nSource:\nDemand Curve\n\nUK eco-cleaning brand Smol uses Facebook Ads to share user-generated content (UGC). This video-based post got plenty of engagement (comments, shares, and likes) and likely led to some trial conversions:\n\nFacebook is a prime meeting place for people and businesses. Meta reports that 1.6 billion users “like” brands on the platform. \n\nIn addition to driving traffic, your sponsored amplification posts could be enough to gain some valuable new followers. \n\nLinkedIn Ads\n\nIf you’re marketing for a B2B brand, LinkedIn is a more suitable content promotion channel. \n\nIts advertising platform, Campaign Manager, allows you to segment 850 million professionals, including 190 million senior executives (i.e., the big decision-makers you’ll want to impress most).\n\nTake this cleverly targeted promotion from Ocean.io. It uses a LinkedIn Ad to amplify “how-to” content on advertising techniques:\n\nThe download link takes users to Ocean.io’s content via an automatically populated web form. In addition to driving more traffic to the advertiser’s site, it helps them collect insightful customer data.\n\n3. Influencer Partnerships\n\nInfluencer marketing helps you reach ad-wary buyers. It’s most useful for engaging consumers on visual channels like Instagram and TikTok. \n\nIt works because people generally trust third-party recommendations more than branded promotion. \n\nBut be careful. Partner with the wrong people to promote your content and you risk wasting budget, alienating potential customers, and damaging your reputation.\n\nGood Foods got it right by partnering with the blogger Target Gems to amplify giveaway content on Instagram:\n\nThe brand’s previous Instagram post received 70 likes after two days, while the collaborative one reached 500 within two hours. This is because it chose an influencer with a large, relevant following.\n\nDiscover Influencer Analytics\n\nthe All-in-One Influencer Marketing Platform\n\nStart Free Trial →\n4. User-Generated Content (UGC)\n\nUGC is the organic equivalent of influencer marketing. It refers to social posts endorsing brands or products that individuals create without being paid.\n\nThe lack of payment can make UGC appear more authentic than influencer marketing content. It carries extra weight as a word-of-mouth promotion because there’s less reason for bias.\n\nFor example, dog accessories brand Cocopup is super active on TikTok. A quick search of the “#cocopup” hashtag brings up plenty of UGC, like this video review:\n\nCocopup could have plugged product reviews and demonstrations from its account but likes to let real customers do the talking. This organic trust-building tactic has helped the brand grow fast.\n\n5. Content Syndication Platforms\n\nContent syndication refers to republishing content via a third-party outlet, like another brand’s website, social profile, or email.\n\nIt can help you get a new marketing strategy off the ground by:\n\nExtending your reach. You’re effectively borrowing a more established platform’s audience to introduce your brand.\nIncreasing backlinks. Content published on other platforms often contains links back to your website (backlinks). These can contribute to search performance. So, in addition to referral traffic (people visiting through the links), you could see organic traffic grow.\n\nThere are two types of content syndication platforms: free and paid.\n\nThe audience you’ll reach depends entirely on the outlet. For example, you could pay to reach young consumers on a platform like Buzzfeed or target corporate decision-makers by posting in a niche community on LinkedIn.\n\nOther popular free channels include Quora, Medium, and SlideShare. \n\nHere’s an example of a repurposed post about user interface (UI) design on Medium:\n\nAt the end of the post, the writer clarifies that the content is a taste of what’s available elsewhere and links back to their book.\n\nAlternatively, paid platforms can get your content onto big-name partner sites to boost your online presence.\n\nFor example, Taboola has ties with media outlets like USA Today, Insider, and CBS News.\n\nHere’s what Taboola’s sponsored content looks like on Insider:\n\nThe downside of paid syndication platforms is that sponsored content can look spammy. Stand out by providing genuine value to your audience and avoiding click-bait headlines.\n\nUK news outlet The Guardian publishes some genuinely insightful paid-for content, like this article from HR consultancy Seek:\n\nIt’s clear that the post is sponsored. But that doesn’t detract from its journalistic quality or audience value.\n\n3 Content Amplification Tools to Get Started\n\nAs with most digital marketing areas, there’s plenty of tech out there to help with content amplification. \n\nYou won’t need it all. But the right tool or two will streamline your processes to boost your ROI.\n\nThree of the best to start with are Semrush, Google Analytics and GaggleAMP.\n\nSemrush\n\nSemrush has various tools to help you plan, execute, and measure content, social media, and ad campaigns—three key elements of content amplification.\n\nThe Content Marketing Toolkit makes it easy to build effective content plans, improve existing ones, find strategy gaps, and write and audit content. \n\nIt’ll support you through the content creation phase and again during amplification, helping you understand what works and what doesn’t so you know what to promote.\n\nThe Social Media Toolkit gives you numerous tools to build your strategy and make social media marketing easier. \n\nIt allows you to create and schedule posts, monitor performance, benchmark your progress against competitors, and interact with followers efficiently–ideal for driving website traffic from social followers.\n\nLastly, the Advertising Toolkit can be your go-to for planning amplification campaigns on Google Ads. It’ll help you research key topics, study competitors’ campaigns, and build your data-informed strategy.\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →\nGoogle Analytics\n\nWhile Google Analytics’ feature set is vast, a couple of its reports are particularly valuable for running content amplification campaigns.\n\nThe Traffic Acquisition report tells you which social media channels drive traffic to your website. That information will help you: \n\nIdentify the best places to promote content \nUnderstand how well your strategies work\n\nThe Multi-Channel Funnels report visualizes the impact your social activity has on revenue and traffic. It’ll help you gauge the big-picture effects of your amplification efforts.\n\nGoogle Analytics is free to use with a Gmail address. You’ll find the Traffic Acquisition report under “Reports” > “Acquisition” and the Multi-Channel Funnels report under “Reports” > “Conversions.”\n\nGaggleAMP\n\nGaggleAMP is an amplification tool that allows you to distribute company content through consenting employees’ social network accounts.\n\nIt’ll help you to:\n\nWiden your audience. By putting branded content in front of employees’ followers, not just the company’s own, you’ll be more visible and build brand awareness.\nBuild trust. People trust other people more than they trust brands. Posting through employee accounts can humanize your message.\n\nAs well as reposting, users can request that employees perform more than 50 activities on various social channels. That includes posting comments, writing reviews, and subscribing to channels.\n\nMake Your Content Work Harder \n\nSuccessful content marketing never stops at the first publication. \n\nFor the best campaign ROI, ensure your work is always visible to the right people—those who fit your ideal customer profile.\n\nA carefully crafted multichannel content amplification strategy will help make that happen.\n\nResearch your audience, run your first campaign, and measure the results. Then use what you learn to refine your approach and repeat. You’ll soon see the full long-term impact of great content marketing.\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
