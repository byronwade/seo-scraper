  "content": "Want to grow your business with competitor traffic analysis? You’re in the right place. \n\nIn this article, you’ll learn how to analyze your competitors’ website traffic, why this strategy works, and which tools give you the most accurate data. \n\nTip: Create a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along with the steps in this guide.\n\nWhat Is Competitor Traffic Analysis? \n\nCompetitor traffic analysis is the process of analyzing your competitors’ website traffic and using the data to improve your own website performance. There are many tools that can help you do competitor analysis, including Semrush’s Traffic Analytics tool.\n\nThese tools can provide you with various metrics and insights, such as:\n\nHow much traffic your competitors are driving\nIf their audience is growing or declining\nWhich channels drive the most traffic \nWhat user experience looks like (i.e., average visit duration and bounce rate)\nVisitor demographics and locations that bring in the most traffic\nWhich pages users visit after visiting their websites\n\nAnd lots more. \n\nEssentially, competitive intelligence helps you see what’s already working for others. And build upon that success.\n \n\nCan You Really Track Competitor Website Traffic? \n\nFor your own website’s traffic data, Google Analytics is the most comprehensive and accurate tool. \n\nBut it won’t do the trick for your competitors. \n\nYou can check a competitor’s site traffic, but you need a specific tool. Like Semrush’s Traffic Analytics.\n\nThe tool leverages clickstream data (data about the pages a user visits) from multiple proprietary and third-party data sources. \n\nThen, it uses an AI algorithm to accumulate, clean, and process the raw data from over 200M+ internet users. \n\nFor example, you’ll be able to see general information about your competitor’s audience. \n\nLike this:\n\nA consumer journey report to see where your competitor’s audience comes from and where they go next. \n\nAnd tons of other traffic insights. Like the top visited pages, top subfolders, geographic distribution, and more. \n\nAnalyze Any Company’s Website Traffic\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Analyze Competitor Website Traffic\n\nData can tell a story. \n\nIt can tell you whether visitors are finding what they’re looking for. Or if your new partnership is paying off. \n\nAmong many other things. \n\nWhich means insights drawn from competitor data can help you outcompete them. And earn more traffic. \n\nLet’s take a look at a few tactics you can use. \n\nMeasure Competitor Website Traffic\n\nLet’s start with a broad view. It helps lay the foundation for more in-depth research later on. \n\nSo, first, enter any competitor website into Traffic Analytics, hit “Analyze,” and you’ll see this dashboard:\n\nYou’ll quickly see estimates of the site’s traffic and engagement. And how they’ve increased or decreased over time. \n\nHere’s a quick overview of what each metric means:\n\nVisits: the estimated total visits to the website during that month\nUnique Visitors: the estimated total unique visitors to the website during that month\nPages/Visit: the average number of pages a person visits in one session on the website\nAvg. Visit Duration: the average amount of time visitors spend on the website\nBounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who leave the website after seeing just one page \n\nYou can also add your domain in the “Root domain” field and compare these broad metrics to yours. \n\nNote: Traffic Analytics data is based on estimates and averages. The best way to look at your real numbers is with Google Analytics. \n\nNow let’s dive a little deeper. \n\nExamine Traffic Trends Across Time\n\nScroll further down in the Traffic Analytics dashboard and you’ll see a trend graph. \n\nLike so:\n\nIt shows the same broad metrics we saw before, but depicted over time. \n\nWhich can help spot any competitor trends and provides a forecast of what they expect to see in May. \n\nAnd you can also add up to four more competitors to compare website traffic data against. \n\nIt may help uncover other trends.\n\nFor example, are there spikes or significant drops in organic traffic? If so, are they seasonal (do they happen every year)? Does it affect all the websites you’re comparing?\n\nThink about what could’ve caused them. \n\nEspecially for spikes. Did a competitor do something special? Was it due to a campaign they ran?\n\nLearning what caused spikes can help you see what works. Then, you can mimic your competitors’ strategies and win some traffic yourself. \n\nLikewise, discovering what caused drops in traffic can help you learn what you should avoid. \n\nCompare Website Traffic Customer Experience \n\nNow let’s compare user experience across your competitors. Namely, pages per visit, average visit duration, and bounce rate. \n\nAdd your domain (or up to four other competitors) to the tool. Click “Compare.”\n\nAnd you’ll quickly see how these user experience metrics compare. \n\nAnalyzing these metrics is important because, sometimes, seeing a high number of visitors can be deceiving. It doesn’t paint the full picture. \n\nComparing these engagement metrics can give you a better understanding of how users are behaving. And if they’re finding what they need. \n\nFor example, has a competitor’s bounce rate worsened over time?\n\nIf so, this could mean: \n\nUsers aren’t finding the content interesting or helpful \nA promoted offer isn’t as good is it seems \nTraffic is coming from countries where the product or service isn’t available\n\nTracking these metrics over time can reveal who is winning when it comes to serving customers what they want. \n\nAnd can help you learn from what is working and steer clear of what is not. \n\nTrack User Sources & Journeys\n\nNow let’s take a look at where your competitors' traffic comes from and goes. \n\nYou’ll see that in the “Traffic Journey” tab. \n\nIf you’re comparing multiple competitors, the first graph shows each competitor’s traffic volume by traffic channel. \n\nLike this:\n\nIf you just analyze one competitor, you’ll see a more detailed graph showing the traffic volume each channel brings in per month. \n\nBoth graphs can help you see the channels driving traffic for your competitors. So you can replicate what’s already working (in a better way). \n\nNow, to understand the user journey, scroll further down. \n\nThis next graph shows where users come from and where they go afterward. \n\nFurther down, the “Traffic Journey Details” table contains more details about the traffic sources and destination sites.\n\nUse this information to identify trends. \n\nFor example, do lots of users go to a particular website after visiting your competitor? Why do you think that is? \n\nPerhaps that site has helpful content that is missing on your competitor’s site. If so, think about adding that content to your site. And try to win (or retain) some traffic that way. \n\nExplore Top Pages, Subdomains, and Subfolders\n\nFirst, to see your competitors' top pages head to the “Top Pages” tab. \n\nYou’ll see a report with detailed data. Including page views, unique visitors, traffic channels for each page, and a variety of sorting options.\n\nTo search for specific pages (those promoted on organic social media or with paid social ads), filter according to the traffic channel to bring those pages to the top. \n\nLike this:\n\nYou can also filter by page. And see the actual page by clicking on it. \n\nFor example, we sorted Vrbo pages by the word “vacation.” \n\nAs the graph shows, the page selected focuses on “Santa Barbara.” And receives a lot of traffic from paid search and organic socials. \n\nWhich means you now have insights into Vrbo’s marketing strategy.\n\nFinally, the “Subfolders” and “Subdomains” tabs show your competitor’s top subfolders and subdomains by traffic and channel. \n\nLike this:\n\nAnd this:\n\nUse this information to determine if you should focus on creating similar subfolders or subdomains. \n\nPro tip:Another tool you can use to monitor traffic changes easily isOrganic Research.\n\nStart by entering the domain name you would like to examine. Navigate to the “Position Changes” tab and then look at the “Top Page Changes” widget to see the domain’s pages with the most change in estimated traffic. \n\nYou can click on the built-in filter icon to be taken to the “All Position Changes” report. \n\nThis report has several preset filters about the keywords your competitor is gaining or losing traffic to (plus more). This makes it easy to isolate certain metrics for more thorough analysis. \n\nYou can even see if they have been dropped in or out of a SERP feature. \n\nOnce you’ve got the specific data you’re looking for, you can export this report using a customizable date range. Click the “Export” button to send the information to an Excel spreadsheet, CSV, or CSV Semicolon. \n\nFurther reading: \n\nWhat Is a Subdomain and How to Set One Up?\nSubdomain vs. Subfolder: Which Is Better for SEO?\nGenerate Audience Insights \n\nThe “Audience Overview” tab is a great starting place for understanding how your market’s audience interacts with you and your competitors. \n\nThe overlap graph shows the size of your competitors' audience. And the extent to which their audiences overlap. \n\nFor example, the graph below depicts the audiences for five major U.S. newspapers.\n\nThe largest circle belongs to The New York Times, indicating they have the largest audience with 48.6M monthly visitors. \n\nThey share the largest overlap with The Washington Post, meaning 7.9M people who visited The New York Times website also visited The Washington Post. \n\nTo see smaller newspapers in relation to each other, use the drop-down menu. \n\nThe graph shows that The Wall Street Journal shares a larger audience with The New York Times than the LA Times does. \n\nAnd the shared audience between The Wall Street Journal and the Chicago Tribune is also quite small.\n\nUsing this information, you might learn who you could partner with or which audiences to target to grow your traffic.\n\nNote: For more detailed audience insights, check out One2Target. You’ll get information about their income levels, employment status, education level, interests, and more.\n\nTrack Competitor Web Traffic Globally \n\nThe “Geo Distribution” tab shows information about audiences worldwide. \n\nFor a general picture of a competitor’s global web traffic, start by analyzing the “Traffic Map.” \n\nIn this case, the majority of The Guardian’s traffic is split between the United States and the United Kingdom—with the U.K. taking the prize when it comes to total traffic numbers. \n\nOn the map, countries that account for less than 10% of the website traffic are light blue, suggesting there is some audience in these countries, even if those markets are small.\n\nFor a closer look at traffic trends over time, scroll down to the “Trend by Visits” graph. \n\nThe graph above shows the growth trend in various countries. \n\nFor example, notice the spike in traffic from Australia in late 2020. It might be a good idea to do some more research into this specific market. \n\nAnd the “Traffic by Country” table below shows data for specific locations. Each entry has a drop-down tab that shows top website pages in that country. \n\nConsidering the Australian market again, the market seems to be growing. And may be a good target for future growth. \n\nAnd examining the country’s top pages (business, education, and U.K. news), you might need to consider similar content if you’re looking to expand into this market. \n\nTake Competitor Analysis a Step Further \n\nChecking competitor website traffic is a smart way to boost your own website’s traffic. \n\nBut you shouldn’t stop there. \n\nConducting a more thorough competitor analysis can help you capitalize on their weaknesses, replicate their strengths, and prioritize tasks. \n\nFor example, you can run a keyword gap analysis to find keywords your competitors are ranking for but you aren’t. \n\nOr find sites that link to your competitors but not to you. Or discover their best-performing pages to create something better or similar. \n\nCheck out Semrush’s suite of competitor analysis tools.
