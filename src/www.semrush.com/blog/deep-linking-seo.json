  "content": "What Is Deep Linking for SEO?\n\nDeep linking for SEO is when you add links to specific, relevant pages on your website rather than general ones like the homepage. Like blog posts, pricing pages, and case studies.\n\nThis process helps your content rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs). \n\nAnd makes it easier for users to navigate your website.\n\nDeep links can be internal or external. Internal deep links are links within your own content that point to your specific pages. \n\nFor instance, in our “Link Building for SEO: The Beginner’s Guide” piece, there’s an internal link to our “What Is Anchor Text? Best Practices for Optimizing Link Text” post.\n\nWhile external links are backlinks from other websites that take readers to your relevant content.\n\nLike this Backlinko piece that links to our anchor text blog post:\n\nBuild Backlinks Easily\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nWhy Is Deep Linking Important for SEO?\n\nLinks are one of the most important ranking factors.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause links in and pointing to your content help you build credibility in the eyes of readers and search engines. Deep links, in particular, demonstrate the depth and breadth of relevant, useful content that your site contains.\n\nSo, deep links help you establish your Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). Which play a key role in Google’s Search Quality Rater Guidelines.\n\nFun facts: \n\nIn studying 11.8 million Google search results, Backlinko found that higher rankings were “strongly” correlated with a website’s link profile. And, on average, web pages ranking for the top spot have nearly four times as many backlinks than the second through 10th spots.\nAuthorityHacker also found that, on average, pages that ranked in the top four spots all had more internal links than those in spots five through 10.\nIt Distributes Link Equity and Boosts Your Credibility\n\nGoogle uses its PageRank algorithm to measure the value of your content based on the number and quality of links pointing to it. \n\nAnd deep linking for SEO passes link authority, otherwise known as link equity or link juice, from the linking page to the target page. It’s like getting a “thumbs up” on your content that Google sees as a vote of confidence.\n\nThe more link authority you distribute, the more pages that have a better chance of ranking.\n\nSome pages, like your homepage or pillar pages, probably have more links pointing to them. But other pages, like specific blog posts on your website, may have fewer links. \n\nBy deep linking from high-authority pages (e.g., homepage) to lower-authority pages (e.g., blog posts), you can pass more link equity to those pages and boost their ranking potential.\n\nFurther reading: Everything You Need to Know About Google PageRank\n\nIt Creates Clear Connections Between Your Pages\n\nDeep linking for SEO makes it easier for search engines to find, index, and rank your web pages. \n\nBasically, it creates a clear “map” for search engines to follow. Without this map, it’s harder to locate your content. And if Google can’t find your web pages, it’s even less likely that people will find them.\n\nPro tip\n\nYou need to have a logical website structure to make deep links meaningful and improve your website navigation. Users should be able to follow a clear path from one deep-linked page to related content on your site.\n\nTopic Clusters \n\nFor example, say you have five pages on your site about planning a trip to Disney World:\n\nDisney World Planning Guide\nDisney World Packing List\nDisney World Budgeting\nDisney World Restaurants\nDisney World Hotels\n\nAdding deep links between each of these pages helps users and Google find them easily. And this interlinking shows Google that you have content on related, relevant concepts. \n\nWhich demonstrates your website’s subject matter expertise, helping you climb the SERPs to drive more traffic.\n\nThese kinds of related, interlinked pages are known as topic clusters or content hubs.\n\nSo, your topic cluster on Disney World might look like this: \n\nUsing a tool like Keyword Strategy Builder, you can group together keywords to figure out topics that can fit together as part of a larger topic cluster.\n\nThe Topical Overview view illustrates a visual representation of how the main topics and subpages relate to each other. \n\nIf you scroll down, you can review metrics for the pillar pages, subpages, and keyword clusters. \n\nWhen you're ready, you can select \"Write Content\" to create content based on a keyword. \n\nAnchor Text\n\nThe anchor text you choose also impacts Google’s understanding of your site content and structure.\n\nAnchor text is the text a user clicks to visit a link. \n\nBasically, the anchor text gives Google a sneak peek of what the linked content is about. And helps it form connections between the linked topics.\n\nSo, using clear, descriptive anchor text tells Google what topics and keywords your website covers.\n\n(We’ll go over this more in the “Optimize Your Link Anchor” section later).\n\nFurther reading: Keyword Clustering in a Flash: An Update to the Keyword Strategy Builder Tool\n\nOrganize Keywords by Similarity\n\nwith the Keyword Strategy Builder Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nIt Makes It Easier for Users to Browse Your Website\n\nDeep linking for SEO gives users easier access to relevant content on your site. So, they’re more likely to visit multiple pages and stay on your site longer.\n\nThe result?\n\nReaders gain trust with your brand, so they can start to move them down the marketing funnel. And your website’s bounce rate goes down.\n\nImportant:\n\nYour bounce rate isn’t a direct ranking factor. But a high bounce rate tells search engines that users don’t find your content useful. And content quality is the cornerstone of SEO success.\n\nCheck out our bounce rate guide for other tips on how to lower it.\n\nHow to Implement Deep Links on Your Website\n\nThere are four core practices you can use as part of a deep linking for SEO strategy. Each of these will help you thoughtfully build more deep links that’ll improve your website’s rankings and traffic.\n\n1. Evaluate Your Existing Content for Linking Opportunities \n\nStart by identifying deep link opportunities within your existing web pages.\n\nHere’s how you can do this with our Site Audit tool:\n\nUnder “On Page & Tech SEO,” click on “Site Audit.” \n\nThen, click the blue “Create project” button.\n\nType your domain into the box. And click the green “Create project” button.\n\nGo through the Site Audit Settings to set up your site audit. (If you need help, check out our Site Audit tool guide). You can also set up the site audit for existing projects. \n\nThen, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nAfter the audit is finished, you’ll see a dashboard pop up. Scroll down to the “Internal Linking” box. Click “View details.”\n\nNote\n\nThe score shown in the “Internal Linking” box (60%) represents the overall health of the internal links on your website. The lower the score, the more issues the audit uncovered.\n\nOn the Internal Linking report page, you’ll see the Internal Link Distribution widget. This gives you a high-level look at how you’re spreading link equity across your content.\n\nOur Internal LinkRank (ILR) metric ranks your content in three different categories:\n\n“Strong” pages: ILR greater than 70. Have the highest number of internal links pointing to them. These are usually the most frequently visited pages (e.g., homepage, landing pages). \n“Medium” pages: ILR between 10 and 70. These pages have a medium amount of links pointing to them.\n“Weak” pages: ILR below 10. Have relatively few internal links. These pages have little to no link equity.\n\nIn this example, 77% of all internal links on the site point to just 21% of the site’s pages. So, there’s plenty of content (59%) that can benefit from being linked to more often.\n\nStart off by adding links on “Strong” pages that point to “Medium” and “Weak” pages.\n\nClick on the link that says “XX Weak pages” and open it in a new tab.\n\nThis “Weak Pages” report will list all the pages that could use some internal link boosts.\n\nThen, go back to the Internal Link Distribution widget. Click the “XX Strong pages” link and open it in a separate tab.\n\nThen, you can see a list of your pages with the most link authority.\n\nGo through both lists and look for strategic opportunities to add links to weaker-scoring pages from higher-scoring ones.\n\nWhen looking for places to deep link, consider the following:\n\nRelevance: The content you link to should be relevant to the topic of the page containing the link\nBusiness value: Prioritize adding links to specific, valuable pages within your site, such as product pages, key articles, or landing pages that have a low ILR\nContent pillars and clusters: Adding links to related topics (cluster pages) on pillar content, or in-depth cornerstone pages, helps search engines better understand your website structure\n\nFurther reading: The Most Common Internal Link Building Mistakes: A Semrush Study\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Build Internal Linking Into the Content Creation Process \n\nThe sooner you make deep linking a habit, the faster your content performance can improve.\n\nIt’s easy to skip adding internal links when writing new web content for the sake of time. Especially if you have a lot of content or don’t have a content team to support you.\n\nBut without deep linking, you’re missing a powerful way to improve your rankings and traffic. \n\nAnd it doesn’t need to be overwhelming. You can quickly find relevant content to link to by heading over to Google and performing a Google site search.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nVisit Google.\n\nIn the search bar, type “site:[website.com]” and a keyword or topic that you’re discussing in the piece of content you’re working on. You don’t need a “www.” before the domain. \n\nSay we wanted to find Semrush content on internal links. Our search would look like this:\n\nPress the “Google Search” button. Then, you’ll see a list of web pages on that website that mention your topic keyword.\n\nThen, review the results for pages to link to.\n\nContinue to do this each time you have a new post. And run a Site Audit once a month or quarterly (depending on your bandwidth) to make sure you’re effectively spreading that link authority around.\n\nCreate Quality Content in Seconds\n\nwith AI Writing Assistant\n\nTry It Free →\n3. Optimize Your Link Anchor Text\n\nAs we previously mentioned, your anchor text is as important as the link itself.\n\nYour anchor text tells both readers and search engines what topic is being covered. So, it needs to be specific and relevant.\n\nDon’t use generic anchor text like “click here” or “this article.”\n\nInstead, use descriptive anchor text like, “SEO guide” or “packing for Disney World tips.”\n\nPro tip\n\nTry to keep your anchor text under five words so it’s still easy to read.\n\nAnd incorporate target keywords into your anchor text where it feels natural. \n\nCheck out our anchor text guide for more tips to optimize your text.\n\n4. Reach Out to High-Quality Websites to Write Guest Posts\n\nInternal deep links are an important part of your SEO strategy. But building backlinks from external websites are just as important for improving your rankings.\n\nWriting guest posts on another website is a common way to do this.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause many brands are willing to publish content from outside experts. \n\nThis way, they can quickly publish more high-quality content without having to pay for more writers. And you build your authority, traffic, and backlink profile. It’s a win-win.\n\nWhen looking for guest posting opportunities, you want to choose credible websites that are relevant to your niche or industry. \n\nSo, how do you find them?\n\nYou could search manually. But that takes a lot of time.\n\nInstead, try our Link Building Tool.\n\nEnter your homepage URL and click the “Start Link Building” button.\n\nClick on the “Keywords” tab. Then, enter relevant keywords or topics in the “Add your keywords” box. Click “Add.”\n\nNote\n\nBased on your domain, the keyword box might automatically suggest certain keywords or phrases. You can leave them in or remove them by clicking the trash can icon to the right of the keyword. \n\nNow, click on the “Competitors” tab. \n\nYou’ll see a list of suggested competitor domains. If you want to remove them and add in your own, hit the red “Remove all competitors” trash can in the top right corner. Then, type your new ones in.\n\nWhen you’re finished, click the green “Start Link Building” button. \n\nAfter a few minutes, you’ll see a box that says “Collecting and analyzing data is complete.” \n\nClick the “View prospects” button. \n\nNow, you’ll see a custom database of relevant sites where you could potentially guest post.\n\nClick on “Advanced filters” to sort through your results. We suggest using “URL Type” first and selecting “Blog” to narrow things down.\n\nNow, click the column labeled “AS” to sort these websites by our Authority Score. Generally, the higher the AS, the more credible the site is. The highest score is 100. \n\nWe determine each website’s AS by evaluating:\n\nLink power: Quality and quantity of backlinks\nOrganic traffic: Estimated monthly average of traffic \nSpam factors: Indicators of manipulation or spam in the link profile\n\nSave the sites you’d like to write for by clicking the drop-down arrow next to the “To In Progress” button > “Guest post.”\n\nThis will add the site to your “In Progress” tab, where you can keep track of your outreach efforts. Our cold email templates post can help you write solid pitches. And the tool can help identify the correct email addresses for sending pitches.\n\nOnce you’ve gotten the green light to guest post, keep these tips in mind while writing:\n\nAvoid competing with yourself: Don’t write an article that’s too similar to something you’ve already written or are planning to post. Put a new spin on the topic you’re covering so it doesn’t compete with your own site for rankings and traffic.\nFocus on being helpful to readers, not just yourself: It’s obvious when brands are salesy or overly-promotional. And it steers readers away from wanting to revisit your content. Attract new traffic and higher rankings by creating unique, useful content.\nKeep the links to a minimum: While guest posts are great opportunities to build your backlink profile, you don’t want to go overboard on the deep links. Or your piece will seem spammy. One to three links back to your website is reasonable.\n\nOnce the post goes live, make sure to share it on social media to help boost its reach and your opportunities to earn backlinks.\n\nFurther reading: How to Guest Post for SEO in 2023\n\nBuild Organic Landing Pages\n\nwith the SEO Content Template Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nTake Your SEO to the Next Level\n\nUsing deep links is a powerful part of an SEO strategy.\n\nBut it’s just one piece of the puzzle. \n\nTake the guesswork out of optimizing your pages with our On Page SEO Checker.\n\nFrom internal link suggestions to content tweaks, this tool gives you comprehensive recommendations on how to improve your rankings for any page on your site.\n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →",
