  "content": "Content marketing is a type of marketing that involves creating and sharing valuable content with your audience. \n\nIt’s one of the most effective ways to grow your business—when done well.\n\nAnd if you want to be successful, you need a solid content marketing strategy.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll teach you how to create one. But first, let’s start with the basics.\n\nWhat Is a Content Marketing Strategy?\n\nA content marketing strategy is a plan for creating and sharing content that appeals to your target audience. And helps you achieve your business goals.\n\nYou might assume that creating a content marketing strategy is complex. But that doesn’t have to be the case. It just needs the right elements.\n\nAt a high level, it should at least include the following information:\n\nSpecific goals (i.e., what exactly you want to achieve with your content)\nAudience insights (i.e., who your content is for)\nContent types (i.e., what kinds of content you’ll create)\nPromotion plan (i.e., how you’ll distribute your content)\n\nFor example, let’s say you’re making a content marketing strategy for a website in the health and fitness niche.\n\nYour goal might be to get a certain percentage increase in relevant traffic from search engines. The audience could be young individuals who want to lose weight and/or stay fit. The content types may include blog posts and videos relating to workout plans and diet.\n\nAnd to promote this content, you might distribute it via your email newsletter, your social media channels, and your website—to draw visitors through SEO (i.e., ranking in search engines).\n\nWhy Have a Content Marketing Strategy?\n\nWithout a guiding strategy, content marketing efforts can feel haphazard. But a well-defined strategy has several benefits:\n\nIt aligns your content with business goals. So you don’t waste resources creating something that has no value for your company.\nIt helps you get stakeholder support. You can communicate the value of your content marketing efforts to management and senior leadership. And get their buy-in.\nIt streamlines your content creation and distribution process. You can plan, publish, and promote your content more efficiently and effectively.\nIt enables you to analyze and optimize your results over time. You can measure and track your content performance so you can adjust your strategy as needed to achieve your goals.\n\nAnd make sure it’s documented. Because our State of Content Marketing report shows there’s a correlation between success and having a documented content marketing strategy.\n\nNow, let’s see how to actually create a content strategy.\n\n8 Steps to Creating a Successful Content Marketing Strategy \n\nBelow, we’ll cover how to create a content marketing strategy for your business. \n\n1. Set a Goal\n\nThe first step of formulating any content marketing strategy is to define a goal. \n\nWhat do you want to achieve with your content? \n\nYour goal will shape everything about your strategy, so make sure it’s clear upfront.\n\nPotential goals could include:\n\nEstablish yourself as a thought leader in your niche\nIncrease traffic from search engines by 50% over the next year\nAchieve 30% year-on-year sales growth\nImprove customer retention by 20%\nGet 1,000 new backlinks (links from other sites pointing to your pages) in the next six months\n\nContinuing from the previous content strategy example, let’s say your goal is to increase traffic from search engines by 50%.\n\n2. Understand Your Audience\n\nWith your content goal(s) defined, the next critical step is to understand the target audience you're trying to attract.\n\nYou can create the most mind-blowing content in the world, but it could be practically worthless if it doesn't resonate with the right people. \n\nTo know your audience, you need to answer questions like:\n\nWho are they? Go beyond just basic demographics to their deeper beliefs, values, fears, and aspirations.\nWhat are their biggest pain points, challenges, and problems related to your products/services?\nWhere do they spend time online? And which information sources do they trust most?\nWhat types of content capture their attention and compel them to take action?\n\nDon't rely on assumptions or guesswork here. You need real data from surveys, interviews, and other audience research tactics.\n\nUse Semrush’s One2Target tool to gather some of these insights.\n\nTo get started, open the tool, enter at least one competitor website, and click “Analyze.” \n\nIn the “Demographics” tab, you’ll see the audience’s age and gender information.\n\nThis can help you tailor your tone and language to what might appeal most to that specific demographic.\n\nIn the “Socioeconomics” tab, you’ll find the audience’s household size, income level, employment situation, and education. Which can help you adjust your content to their lifestyle. \n\nAnd in the “Behavior” tab, you’ll get insights into the audience’s online behavior. Meaning which social media platforms they use and the types of websites they visit. \n\nThis can help you decide which platforms to share your content on.\n\nLooking at the overall research data, here’s some of what we learned about our audience for a health and fitness website:\n\nThe majority of the audience is young individuals between 18 and 34 years old, with three to four people in their household and relatively low incomes \nMost work full-time and show a strong preference for video content on YouTube, as well as written material like blog posts from online publications\nThey’re also active on social media sites such as Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram \n\nGet Audience Insights\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Choose Your Content Types\n\nThe next step is to choose the content types you’ll focus on.\n\nThere are lots of content types you can choose from: \n\nBlog posts\nVideos\nPodcasts\nEbooks\nInfographics\n\nHow do you know which ones are the best?\n\nBoth your goals and your audience insights should inform your choices. \n\nUsing our same example from before, we’re going to focus on blog posts and videos. Because they align with our goal of increasing our traffic from search engines. \n\nPlus, our audience research showed a preference for those two content formats. Our intended audience likes to consume video content on YouTube and read blog posts from online publications.\n\n4. Find Topic Ideas to Cover\n\nNow, it’s time to discover the specific topics you’ll create content around.\n\nIf you’re focused on blog posts, you need to choose topics that have high search demand. Otherwise, you won’t get organic (unpaid) traffic to your site—which is one of our main goals for this strategy.\n\nTo find topics, use Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nOpen the tool, enter a broad term related to your niche, and click “Search.”\n\nThen, go to the “Questions” tab.\n\nAnd the tool will display topic ideas in the form of questions.\n\nFor each keyword, you’ll see detailed insights such as how popular the topic is (search volume) and how difficult it is to rank for it in Google (keyword difficulty).\n\nWe’ll explain how to use this information to pick the best topics later. But now, let’s quickly see how to find topic ideas for YouTube videos that can drive views, engagement, and eventually website traffic.\n\nTo find these topics, use the Keyword Analytics for YouTube app.\n\nOpen the tool, enter a broad term related to your niche in the search bar, and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see lots of topic ideas. \n\nIn addition to topic ideas, the tool also displays the top videos associated with each topic on the right-hand side of the screen.\n\nThis feature provides a clear view of what successful content in your niche looks like.\n\nUnderstanding this helps you create similar (or even better) content.\n\nFind Content Topics\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Prioritize Topics with High Potential\n\nYou now probably have hundreds of topic ideas at your disposal. But which ones should you pursue first?\n\nLet your goal guide your choices. Continuing from the previous example, our goal is focused on getting more traffic from search engines.\n\nSo, we’ll need to prioritize topics that receive a fair number of monthly searches.\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool organizes topics by this criterion by default.\n\nBut make sure the topics you choose are within your ranking capabilities. Meaning, they shouldn’t be too difficult for you to rank for. \n\nTake a look at the “KD %” column to gauge the difficulty of ranking for each topic on Google. The higher the percentage, the tougher the competition.\n\nApply the same logic when selecting topics for YouTube videos. Our Keyword Analytics for YouTube app gives you the important metrics to make the right choices.\n\nAnd when you’re ready, you can easily export these topics using the export button.\n\n6. Create a Content Calendar\n\nNow that you’ve prioritized your topics, it’s time to put everything in a content calendar.\n\nA content calendar is a document that helps you plan, coordinate, and execute your content strategy. It records all the details of your upcoming content, such as the:\n\nTopic and title\nOwner \nContent type\nStatus (writing, recording, editing, etc.)\nDue date\n\nMaintaining a calendar like this helps you ensure consistency in your content publishing. And keeps you on track with your goals.\n\nAlso, make sure to define roles and responsibilities for your team members. So everyone knows what they need to do and when they need to do it.\n\nYou can use something as simple as Google Sheets to create a content calendar. Or you can use tools like Trello, Asana, or Basecamp if you need something more sophisticated.\n\n7. Promote Your Content\n\nYour content strategy should have a clear plan for distributing and amplifying your content to reach your target audience.\n\nHere are a few content promotion strategies:\n\nEmail marketing: Use your email list to notify your subscribers about your new content and encourage them to engage with it\nSocial media: Use your social media platforms to share your content with your followers and drive engagement.\nPaid advertising: If you have the budget, you can also use Google ads and/or Meta advertising solutions to boost your content’s visibility and reach more people\nContent syndication: Share your content on third-party sites (like Medium) to tap into new audiences\nPublic relations (PR): Utilize PR tactics to get your content featured in media outlets and publications that your target audience trusts\nInfluencer marketing: Partner with influencers (famous bloggers and/or social media personalities) to share your content\nSearch engine optimization (SEO): Optimize your content so it starts ranking higher in search results\n\nNot every tactic will make sense for every business. And the promotion channels you prioritize should align with your goals, audience preferences (i.e., where your audience is actively consuming content), and budget. \n\nFor example, our audience research showed that for a health and fitness website, the primary audience frequently uses YouTube and other social media platforms like Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram. And they also read blog posts from online publications.\n\nSo social media, paid advertising, SEO, influencer marketing, and PR have to be our main focus when distributing content.\n\n8. Monitor Your Performance\n\nA good content marketing strategy doesn't end with creating and promoting content. It’s also important to continuously measure the impact of your strategy.\n\nThis will help you see if your content is working toward your goals. And if you need to make any changes to improve your performance.\n\nThe specific metrics you track will depend on your goal.\n\nFor example, you can use Google Analytics to measure your traffic performance. This is the most widely used tool for tracking traffic data.\n\nFor YouTube, you can use YouTube Analytics to see how your videos perform.\n\nTo track Google rankings for each of your main keywords, use the Position Tracking tool.\n\nOpen the tool, type your domain name, and click “Set up tracking.”\n\nIn the “Targeting” section, configure your tracking preferences by choosing a search engine, device, location, and language.\n\nThen, proceed by clicking “Continue To Keywords.”\n\nInput the keywords you wish to monitor into the text box and add them to your campaign with a simple click on “Add keywords to campaign.”\n\nThen, initiate the tracking process by selecting “Start Tracking.”\n\nNow, the tool will maintain a continuous watch over your keyword rankings. \n\nRegularly review your performance data to identify what's working well and what needs improvement. And make adjustments based on your findings.\n\nStart Crafting Your Content Marketing Strategy\n\nYou just learned how to create and execute a content strategy.\n\nNow, it’s time to put these steps into practice. And start creating your own strategy.\n\nThroughout the process, Semrush tools and data will help you effectively execute your strategy.\n\nTry them for free.
