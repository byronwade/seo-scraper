  "content": "Blogging is a great way to share your ideas, opinions, and expertise with the world. \n\nBut how do you make your blog stand out from the crowd? How do you attract and retain loyal readers? How do you turn your passion into a profitable business? \n\nThese are some of the questions that many bloggers face every day. \n\nIn this article, we’ll give you some blogging tips that’ll help you take your blog to the next level. \n\nWhether you are a beginner or an experienced blogger, you'll find something useful and inspiring in this guide. \n\nBlogging Tips for Beginners\nEstablish clear objectives\nFind your blogging niche\nAnalyze your competitors\nPick a blogging platform\nRead other blogs consistently\nBuild a content strategy\nFind topics with high potential\nEstablish a posting schedule\nWrite for your readers first\nUse AI the smart way\nMake your titles clickable\nMake your blogs easy to read\nOptimize content for search intent\nShare unique research\nCollaborate with other bloggers\nInclude external sources\nEdit thoroughly\nDistribute and promote on various channels\nGuide blog visitors to take action\nTrack blog performance\nRefresh and repurpose your content\nCreate a quality control process\n1.Establish Clear Objectives\n\nWhether you run your own blog or grow a corporate website, setting up objectives should be your priority.\n\nIf your company has decided to start a blog, make sure to create a list of business goals you hope to accomplish.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n“We are starting a company blog to increase brand awareness and visibility by ranking for high-volume keywords.” \n“We are launching a blog to generate more conversions by sharing product-led content.”\n\nIf you are building a personal blog, a business model should still be at the forefront of your mind. \n\nAccording to Adam Connell, Founder of Blogging Wizard, it’s key to understand all critical components your content needs in order to achieve your goals.\n\nThere are typically four components to any successful content-based business. Whether this be a blog, YouTube channel, or something else. Start with understanding your business model. This should drive every marketing decision you make. Once you understand how you'll drive revenue and win new business, you can integrate the other core components—your audience, content, and marketing. The key is to have all of these components in perfect alignment.\n\nAdam Connell, Founder of Blogging Wizard\n\nYou can plan to monetize your blog by running ads or offering paid courses to help you set a specific course of development for your blog.\n\n2. Find Your Blogging Niche \n\nHalf the fun of blogging is writing about topics you’re interested in. When you demonstrate your passion for a topic, your readers will be more invested in what you have to say.\n\nIt’s also essential to find out whether there’s demand for what you have to share. \n\nYou can investigate the demand for your topic by:\n\nAnalyzing the search volume for your topics and keywords\nTalking with people in your network\nBeing active on community platforms and forums like Reddit and Quora\nDigging into social media platforms, including LinkedIn and Facebook groups\n\nAs per Lenox Powell:\n\nIdeally, target audience research—even persona creation—has been done long before a blog post topic is selected. But the rubber meets the road when you actually write it. Your target audience should be front and center of your mind when writing the post. A blog is just a publishing platform. How well the content on that platform respects your audience, gives them useful information in an enjoyable way, and puts their needs first is what matters most.\n\nLenox Powell, Content Strategy Manager at Fortified Health Security\n\nIn reality, it applies to both corporate blogs and individual bloggers. Always strive to find the spot where your background, your mission, and your expertise intersect with an actual market gap.\n\nIf you’re not entirely sure which niche to choose, here are some questions to help you brainstorm which kind of blog to write:\n\nWhat are your interests and passions?\nWhat are some areas where you can share real-life experiences?\nAre there others talking about your same interests?\nWhich ones have the lowest competition?\nDo your potential topics get a lot of traffic?\nWhat are some ways you can monetize your blog?\n\nThe GrowingYourCraft website is a great example of a niche business with a niche content offering. \n\nIn addition to offering an integrated learning experience for growing your Etsy shop, they run a blog that covers the trendiest topics in the niche.\n\n3. Analyze Your Competitors\n\nBy analyzing your competitors, you can get a deeper understanding of what’s trending in your niche. It’ll also help you see what kind of blog topics and formats resonate with your audience.\n\nIf you’re not sure how to analyze your competitors, use this free template for competitive content analysis and focus on the following:\n\nIdentify the key websites creating content in your niche (even if they’re not your direct competitors)\nAnalyze the content categories they have on their blogs, the most popular pages, and the keywords they are ranking for\nFind out what makes each of them unique and what their differentiation points are\nAssess their tone of voice, the visual look, and overall formatting\nLearn about ways they are monetizing their websites\nExamine their social media channels\n\nFor example, imagine you wanted to see which topics and keywords perform well for GrowingYourCraft’s competitors. \n\nFirst, manually inspect their websites to find the most popular/trending blog section or identify topics they seem to target the most.\n\nIf you are not sure how to find your competitors, you can start by googling the most important keywords related to your business (e.g. “etsy courses\") and analyzing the websites ranking on the first pages.\n\nTo make this process more data-driven, head to the Organic Research tool and enter your own domain. \n\nThen, head to the “Competitors” tab to see the websites in your niche that are competing with yours.\n\nThen, click on any of those websites to learn more about each competitor. \n\nYou can use the “Pages” report to find the pages (and keywords) that have been performing well for each of those websites.\n\n4. Pick a Blogging Platform\n\nFinding the right content management system (CMS) is important. This is the platform you will use to host and manage your blog.\n\nChoosing the best one will depend on several factors, including your budget, your customization needs, customer support, etc. \n\nIf you are launching a corporate blog, you will also need to check whether your existing business website is already being managed via a CMS. If it’s not, think about ways to connect them.\n\nThere are many great blogging platforms with varying capabilities. But the most popular ones are:\n\nWordPress (used by 43% of all websites)\nWebflow\nDrupal\nGhost\n\nIf you plan on using WordPress, be sure to check hosting sites like GoDaddy, Bluehost, and Siteground for their WordPress website subscriptions. \n\nOftentimes, they are more affordable than hosting a website directly from WordPress.\n\nYou can also use drag-and-drop type platforms like Wix and Squarespace, which are easier to use and are good for beginners. However, their capabilities can be somewhat limited compared to the other CMS products.\n\nEnsure technical optimization \n\nOnce you have your blogging platform set up, ensure that all potential technical issues are taken care of. \n\nIt’s important to make your website crawlable by search engines and to avoid having pages that are loading too slowly.\n\nYou can use the Site Audit tool to automatically check your website and find any important issues that need to be fixed.\n\n5. Read Other Blogs Consistently\n\nNovelists should read more books to be better authors and bloggers should read more blogs to be better bloggers.\n\nWhen we read other work besides ours, we are exposed to other ideas, other writing styles, other tones of voice. And all of what we read can influence how we write. \n\nSo no matter how much time you have during the day, whether it’s 30 minutes or two hours, spend some time reading through online content that interests you or is related to your niche. \n\nEven reading content outside of our interests or wheelhouse can be beneficial!\n\nIf you’re not sure whose content to read, try reading content by influencers, thought leaders, subject matter experts, publications, and even your competitors. \n\n6. Build a Content Strategy for Your Blog\n\nNow that you have a platform and a good understanding of your niche and audience, it’s time to start building a content strategy.\n\nSure, you can aimlessly cover various blogging topics on the fly and see where they stick. But in the long term, that isn’t always the best solution. \n\n80% of marketers felt their blogs performed better when they had a strategy. With a strategy, marketers can focus on goals more, find areas for improvement, and create more measurable progress. \n\nA good strategy also helps you establish your brand and story more clearly. That way, your audience knows who you are and what you’re about from the beginning.\n\nDocumenting your content strategy will involve listing the following items:\n\nYour target audience\nPrimary goals for your blog (e.g., building a contact list and converting those people into paying customers)\nMetrics you’ll use to track performance (e.g., traffic and newsletter subscriptions)\nResources and budget\n\nNext, you’ll move to creating a content plan for your blog that will speak to specific content topics, keywords, dates, promotion tactics, etc.\n\n7. Find Content Topics with High Potential\n\nNow it’s time to find content topics you can cover on your blog. \n\nIt’s important to focus on the high-efficiency topics that have lower competition and an optimal search volume, especially at the beginning. \n\nYou can find high-efficiency topics using the Topic Research tool. Simply enter a high-level idea and it’ll generate dozens of related subtopics.\n\nFilter them by topic efficiency.\n\nIt means that the tool will show topics that have the best combination of search volume and ranking difficulty.\n\nOnce you’ve selected your topics, proceed to more detailed keyword research using the Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nLooking to speed this process up?\n\nTry AI content tools like ContentShake AI. It suggests weekly new content ideas based on what's trending in your niche.\n\nSimply pick a content idea and ContentShake AI will generate a SEO-friendly blog post optimized for your target keywords.\n\n8. Establish a Posting Schedule\n\nYou want your customers to rely on you. You also want them to be repeat readers as your website grows. \n\nPosting consistently shows your readers you are dedicated to your website and its growth. It also helps you rise in the rankings much faster.\n\nWhen you’re setting up your strategy, be sure to factor in not only a writing schedule but also a posting frequency. \n\nDo you want to post once a week, twice a week, or four times a week? \n\nDecide which post frequency will work best for you. If doing four posts a week feels like a lot, start with one or two posts per week.\n\nIf you don’t blog often, that isn’t a bad thing; blogging randomly here and there is terrible. The biggest mistake is committing to a specific frequency, then not delivering on your promise to your audience.\n\nAndy Crestodina, Chief Marketing Officer and Co-Founder of Orbit Media Inc.\n\nThere are a few ways to make sure you’re maintaining your blog post frequency. \n\nYou can:\n\nBlog from your phone on mobile apps like Notepad, WordPress, Google Docs, etc.\nWrite a few posts at a time and schedule them weeks in advance\nJot your ideas down as they come to you and expand on them later if time is limited\n\nBeing consistent, having a schedule, and keeping up with your ideas will help you in the long run. It will also save you more time than being a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants blogger.\n\n9. Write for Your Readers First\n\nWriting for search engines is important because you want to rank. But if you write for search engines first, you risk losing your readers and their attention.\n\nAnd if you’re writing for yourself, that can also turn readers away. You can still write about topics you’re passionate about while meeting your readers’ needs, though.\n\nTake recipe blogs, for example. \n\nRecipe bloggers tend to give a lengthy and detailed history of their simple chicken and dumpling recipe before getting to the ingredient list.\n\nBecause of the way they structure their blogs, recipe bloggers as a whole have faced criticism.\n\nKeep in mind, the most important thing is to make sure your reader gets what they came for when they visit your blog. \n\nThey should have something to walk away with, whether it’s a new product, new information, or a deeper inspiring message.\n\nAs per Ardath Albee, CEO at Marketing Interactions:\n\nWrite for the takeaway. What will your reader learn and remember from their experience with your blog post? The relevance of that learning/insight will keep them coming back for more.\n\nArdath Albee, CEO & B2B Marketing Strategist at Marketing Interactions\n\n10. Use AI the Smart Way\n\nAI can save you hours of work and lead to better outcomes.\n\nFor example, 79% of small businesses and bloggers report an increase in content quality thanks to AI.\n\n65% of them also see an improvement in SEO rankings when using AI.\n\nHow do they achieve this?\n\nBy combining AI with human oversight. \n\nRemember: Google does not penalize AI content. What Google really cares about is your content’s quality.\n\nSo, here's how to use AI writing tools:\n\nLeverage AI to brainstorm ideas and analyze your audience\n\nEnrich your AI content with original ideas and expertise\nUse specialized tools to find keywords and analyze search intent\nFocus on creating a great reader experience\nEdit, fact-check, and further refine your AI content\n\nMany AI tools like ChatGPT don't provide real-time data on keywords, search intent and content optimization.\n\nYou can either pair them with thorough manual research or use specialized content tools like ContentShake AI.\n\nIt combines ChatGPT's capabilities with Semrush's SEO data and a user-friendly blog editor.\n\n11. Make Your Titles Clickable \n\nIt’s essential that you create engaging blog titles that capture the reader and increase the click-through rate (CTR) on search engines and other channels. \n\nThere are variations of articles that get more clicks than others because of how their titles are formatted. Here are some generic variations you may have clicked on yourself:\n\n“How To…”\n“Everything You Need To Know About…”\n“A Guide to…”\n“3, 5, 7, or 9 Things You Should…” (odd numbers in posts get clicked more)\n\nAccording to our research, “Everything You Need To Know” titles and comparison articles generate the most unique monthly pageviews on average.\n\nBesides, “Mistakes To Avoid” articles and guides get the most shares.\n\nA few attributes of engaging blog titles are:\n\nSpecific: Let the reader know right away what to expect\nActionable: Show the reader the value they’ll get from reading the article\nCatching: Hook your readers right away while also keeping them intrigued\n\nFor example, imagine you are writing an article about beginner vegan recipes for people on a gluten-free diet. \n\nIt’s important that your headline showcases that these vegan recipes are easy to cook and fit the gluten-free diet. \n\nYou might also want to share the number of recipes and highlight the uniqueness of your selection.\n\nFor instance:\n\n“20 Vegan & Gluten-Free Recipes You Can Make in 15 Minutes”\n\nOr: \n\n“20 Easy-to-Make Vegan & Gluten-Free Recipes [With Video]”\n\nRemember, your blog’s page title should be between 50 and 60 characters long. It’s also important to include your target keyword(s) in the headline.\n\n12. Make Your Blogs Easy to Read\n\nHave you ever seen a giant wall of text in a post, found it daunting, and left the site immediately?\n\nDon’t worry. We’ve also been there. \n\nBlog posts that look like walls of text tend to drive readers away, increasing bounce rates and decreasing time spent on the page.\n\nTo avoid this, focus on the following:\n\nKeep your paragraphs short (1-3 sentences)\nHave lots of white spaces\nAdd lists, bullet points, and subsections\nKeep your sentences short and focus on one idea per paragraph and per sentence\nAvoid using over-complicated words where possible\nInclude images and videos\nUse bold and italics to highlight important parts of text\n\nHere’s an example of improved readability by breaking up big blocks of text and adding bullet points.\n\nLow Readability\n\n\t\n\nHigh Readability\n\n\n\n\nA crucial part of any successful marketing team is the ability to measure campaign success and establish baselines that can serve as a reference for future efforts. With this in mind, accurately measuring ROI helps marketers do both. By understanding the impact of individual campaigns on overall revenue growth, marketers can better identify the right mix of offline and online campaign efforts. Moreover, measuring ROI consistently allows marketers to establish baselines to quickly gauge their success and adjust efforts in order to maximize impact.\n\n\t\n\nIt is crucial for any successful marketing team to be able to measure campaign success and establish baselines for future reference. Accurately measuring ROI helps marketers do both.\n\nIt allows them to identify the right mix of offline and online activations\nIt enables them to establish baselines to gauge their success and adjust accordingly\n\nYou can also check your copy’s readability automatically using ContentShake AI. The tool highlights paragraphs, sentences, and words that need to be rewritten for readability.\n\nNext, use the AI features to simplify or paraphrase the bits of text that need to be changed.\n\n13. Optimize Content for Search Intent\n\nSearch intent refers to the primary reason a user is googling a certain keyword or phrase. \n\nGoogle aims to show the most relevant pages first, meaning that analyzing those pages can be extremely useful.\n\n“If you want organic search traffic, search intent should be your number one priority. Google your target keyword and look at the top-ranked pages. How are they structured? What subtopics do they cover? Take cues from those pages as you write your blog post.”\n\nIf you want organic search traffic, search intent should be your number one priority. Google your target keyword and look at the top-ranked pages. How are they structured? What subtopics do they cover? Take cues from those pages as you write your blog post.\n\nKyle Byers, Director of Organic Search at Semrush\n\nIn other words, analyzing the top-ranking pages can help you make decisions regarding:\n\nTitle structure \nBlog post format\nAttributes of the audience searching for your keyword (e.g., beginners vs. advanced)\nQuestions and subtopics to cover in the article\nVisual elements to add in your article (e.g., lists and images)\nOptimal length of the blog post\n\nFor example, imagine you were analyzing search intent for “revenue operations.”\n\nIn that case, you could see that your article should target beginner readers and use the “What Is” structure just by looking at the blog titles returned by your search.\n\n14. Share Unique Research\n\nAs per the Helpful Content Update that Google announced in August 2022, creating original and useful content for people (not for search engines) is becoming the number-one success factor.\n\nIn simple terms, it means that content based on real-life experience and featuring original information will be further prioritized by search engines.\n\nHere’s what you can do in this regard:\n\nAvoid publishing blog posts that are simply repeating information from other sources available online\nTalk about your unique experience: for example, if you run a blog for a marketing agency, share the real-life cases and tactics you are using at work\nShare original research: for example, you can run surveys, test products yourself, read and analyze scientific papers\n\nFor instance, in this article on how to make an extra $2,000/month passive income with Etsy printables, the author is sharing real-life experience on generating 5,000 sales annually on Etsy.\n\nThey even provide screenshots from the Etsy store for further evidence. This is a great example of expertise-driven content you can’t replicate.\n\n15. Collaborate with Other Bloggers\n\nFeaturing ideas and insights coming from experts and influencers in your niche is another way to make your content more original.\n\nBesides, building a network of bloggers can help you learn, exchange ideas, and cross-promote and support each other. \n\nThere are several ways you can work with industry experts. For instance:\n\nReach out to ask for a quote or an opinion\nCo-create an article or other content\nRun research together \nCo-promote each other’s content\n\nThe blog site Fluent in 3 Months by Benny Lewis is a great example. As a polyglot, he blogs about how to learn different languages. He also offers other freelance writers opportunities to contribute knowledge on language learning to his blog site, whether they are teachers, travel influencers, or experts in language learning.\n\n16. Include External Sources\n\nHaving good, relevant internal and external sources to support your blog content makes you more credible.\n\nLinking to external sources also gives you opportunities for cross-promotion.\n\nFor example, suppose you are talking about the history of glitter latte art as part of a comprehensive guide for this magical creation. \n\nIn that case, you’ll probably want to link to the people who started the trend, Coffee By Di Bella in Mumbai. \n\nIf your post happens to drive a lot of traffic to their site, you may be able to reach out to the original creators and get them to share your content on their channels.\n\nAs for internal resources, include related posts you’ve already published on the topic you’re writing on. This allows users to visit more areas of your website, makes your content more comprehensive, and sends positive signals to Google.\n\n17. Edit Thoroughly\n\nNothing can turn a reader away like a poorly edited post. And if you’re strapped for time, you might even talk yourself out of editing before you publish—not a good idea. \n\nHere are some ways to edit your work:\n\nRead your blog posts out loud to yourself\nHire an editor from sites like Upwork or Fiverr\nUse editing software like Grammarly and SEO Writing Assistant\n\nUsing Grammarly can help you catch issues, but you shouldn’t rely solely on tools like that to be your editor. \n\nBe sure to take the time to read through your posts, even if 30 minutes is all you can spare. \n\nHaving a dedicated person proofreading your blog posts can be a worthy investment, ensuring the highest quality of your content. \n\n18. Distribute and Promote on Various Channels \n\nIt’s a good idea to think through your distribution strategy even before creating the actual content. \n\nSEO usually takes time, and it’s a good idea to work on a channel mix that will allow you to grow your audience in the short-, mid-, and long-term.\n\nYour decision on the promotion platform will largely depend on your audience. In other words, you should be where your community hangs out.\n\nFor example, Buzzfeed does a great job on Instagram of creating enticing graphics for a visual audience that will also generate clicks. Take this post below as an example.\n\nThey used a headline that was funny and intriguing, while also including one of the disturbing facts mentioned in their content. Ultimately, the image makes you want to go through the trouble of tracking down the link in their bio just to read it.\n\nSuch platforms could include:\n\nSocial media (from Instagram and TikTok to LinkedIn and Twitter)\nForums, as well as platforms like Reddit and Quora\nFacebook and LinkedIn groups\nIndustry community platforms \nIndustry publications \n\nTo make the best decision on your promotion strategy, spend enough time analyzing your audience and their habits. \n\nIt’s also a good idea to continuously engage with various channels and examine special requirements each of those platforms might have. For example, Twitter posts can have a maximum of 280 characters.\n\n19. Guide Blog Visitors to Take Action\n\nOnce you’ve attracted the initial traffic to your blog, it’s important to capture at least a part of it.\n\nOn your site, have a form where people can subscribe to your newsletter. \n\nOne way to do that is by offering gated content on your blog for newsletter subscribers. This way, you’ll be offering something valuable in exchange for your readers’ contact details.\n\nThat will allow you to keep sharing newly published content with subscribers, build a community, and sell your products/services.\n\nWhen designing such conversion paths, think about the following:\n\nHow can you add value? Think newsletter-only exclusive content or downloadable templates, maps, and guides\nHow can you prove its worth? For example, you can mention the topics you will cover in the newsletter and provide social proof (e.g., 300+ Etsy shop owners already subscribed)\nHow can you strategically position your call to actions (CTAs)? Those should be the spots where your offering organically fits. Be careful—adding a dozen pop-ups and random buttons might only create the opposite effect. \n\nFor example, look at how NerdFitness attracts email subscribers. They provide a motivational message with a tone of voice relevant to their audience and offer a gift (a free ebook) to all newcomers. \n\n20. Track Blog Performance\n\nAfter you publish your posts, you should move on to writing the next one, right? \n\nEssentially, yes. But it’s also best to monitor your published posts to see what is performing well and what isn’t.\n\nThere are several important metrics you can track, depending on your goals. The main ones include:\n\nTraffic on your blog (source: Google Analytics)\nSources of that traffic (source: Google Analytics)\nRankings (source: Position Tracking)\nAverage time spent on your blog posts (source: Google Analytics)\nConversion rates on the blogs (source: event tracking in Google Analytics or your marketing automation platform)\n\nIt’s a good idea to have several levels of goals and metrics.\n\nFirst, make sure to refer to the overall goals you’ve set for your blog. Next, regularly track secondary metrics that affect those goals.\n\nFor example, imagine that your goal is to generate a certain number of purchases coming from your blog. In that case, you can set a target for traffic and the average conversion rates you’ll need to achieve this objective.\n\nYou can use this template to get started:\n\nMain objectives\n\n\t\n\ne.g., generate 500 paid course subscriptions coming from blog posts in 2024\n\n\n\n\nPrimary metrics\n\n\t\n\ne.g., course purchases, leads, conversion rates\n\n\n\n\nSecondary metrics\n\n\t\n\ne.g., organic traffic, rankings, social media mentions, and shares\n\n21. Refresh and Repurpose Your Content\n\nRunning content audits should become part of your regular activities. It’ll help you collect the low-hanging fruit—improve existing content to rank higher—and keep track of your overall performance.\n\nContent audits involve analyzing your existing blog posts and assessing whether they help you meet your targets. \n\nFor example, you can check whether they rank for the target keywords and generate traffic and conversions.\n\nBased on the information you collect, you can add several changes, such as:\n\nUpdate blog posts that are losing ranking and traffic\nDelete or update old blog posts with irrelevant information\nRepurpose high-performing blog posts (e.g., create an ebook)\n\nBased on our research, it’s most common to run content audits twice a year.\n\nWe also saw that running content audits tends to generate positive results both for ranking and engagement.\n\n22. Create a Quality Control Process\n\nContent quality is quickly becoming the number-one strategy for ranking on Google. \n\nYou can design a quality assessment process for every blog post published on your website to keep up with this trend.\n\nTo do that, grab our free Blog Post Quality Checklist. Make sure to share it with your writers and use it to check every article before releasing it.\n\nAnd remember to always be on the lookout for new ideas and opportunities for improving your content.\n\nThis could mean learning about the newest Google algorithm update, attending conferences where you learn about SEO and content marketing, or just paying attention to trends and news.\n\nAs a Beginner, What Makes a Successful Blog?\n\nRemember to remain consistent, be authentic, do your research, and always be willing to learn and grow.\n\nBut most importantly, don’t give up. When it feels like you’re not getting back what you’ve invested, just keep going. \n\nNow, let’s click that “publish” button, and we’ll see you in our advanced blogging articles down the road.\n\nCreate unique, engaging content that clicks with your audience\n\nTry ContentShake: Get content ideas, write articles faster with AI, optimize them, and publish directly to your blog.\n\nTry it Now for Free →",
