  "content": "Landing page builders allow you to craft pages that can capture your visitors’ attention and drive conversions—all with a few clicks.\n\nUsing the right software for your site’s needs helps you raise your conversion rate potential and boost your marketing campaigns effectively.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn about the top landing page builders on the market and key factors you must consider when choosing one. So you can maximize your return on investment (ROI).\n\nWhat Are Landing Page Builders?\n\nLanding page builders are digital tools you use to create single pages that encourage visitors to perform a specific action. Like registering for your webinar, signing up for your product demo, or purchasing your product.\n\nIn other words, they’re tools that make it easier to design and set up your website’s landing pages. Which normally contain these elements:\n\nLanding page builders often offer a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop features. Which makes for a straightforward process regardless of your technical knowledge.\n\nFor example, you build a landing page as part of your lead generation strategy to convert visitors into leads. The page design will aim to collect email addresses from prospects interested in your latest product launch. \n\nPage features can include:\n\nA comprehensive product description\nA high-quality image of your product\nA simple signup form to get more info or claim an exclusive pre-launch offer\n\nFocusing on this last single action can optimize your conversion rate. Because the landing page promotes a clear path with next steps for your visitors.\n\nYou can easily customize your design and content with an SEO-friendly landing page builder. Which specifically helps your page perform well in search engine results. \n\nHow?\n\nBy letting you target particular keywords that potential customers use when searching online for services or products like yours. You can tailor your content to meet these needs more closely by addressing search intent (why users make certain search queries).\n\nFurther reading: SEO for Landing Pages: Best Practices to Rank on SERPs\n\nWhat to Look for in a Landing Page Builder\n\nThe best landing page builders are highly functional and straightforward. So you can focus on your marketing goals without getting overwhelmed by complex processes.\n\nConsider the following factors when choosing your landing page builder tool.\n\nEase of use\n\nLook for drag-and-drop interfaces that allow you to create and customize pages quickly. The less time you spend figuring out how to use the tool, the more attention you can dedicate to optimizing your campaigns.\n\nCustomization and templates\n\nA good landing page builder offers a collection of high-quality templates that are visually appealing and fit your requirements. Templates should be easy to customize—so you can brand your pages and tailor content without starting from scratch every time.\n\nIntegrations\n\nEffective landing page builders should work seamlessly with other tools in your marketing stack. Whether it’s customer relationship management systems (CRMs) or analytics tools, easy integration increases your landing page’s functionality.\n\nAnalytics and testing\n\nUnderstanding how visitors interact with your landing pages can help you improve them. Look for builder tools that provide built-in analytics or enable easy connection to platforms like Google Analytics 4. \n\nA/B testing functionality lets you compare different versions of your page to see what converts best.\n\nCustom domains and automation\n\nUsing a custom domain like \"yourcompany.com\" instead of a generic subdomain for your landing page enhances your brand's professional image and credibility. Landing page builders let you connect your custom domains easily. \n\nOn top, page builders enable conversion funnels—sequences of interconnected pages that guide visitors from initial contact to final conversion. Providing a seamless customer journey.\n\nPlus, built-in automation tools can integrate with your domains to automate follow-ups and personalize interactions based on visitor actions. Helping you nurture your leads effectively and boost conversion rates.\n\nSEO and mobile optimization\n\nChoose a landing page builder that enhances your page’s visibility and accessibility.\n\nBuilt-in SEO tools can help your pages get better search engine rankings. They often include automatic mobile optimization that delivers a seamless experience across all devices—which can also contribute to higher SEO ranking. \n\nThis dual functionality not only simplifies the page creation process. It also maximizes the effectiveness of your campaigns by reaching a broader audience.\n\nTop 7 Landing Page Builders\n1. Semrush Landing Page Builder\n\nThe Semrush Landing Page Builder app—developed by Landingi—lets you create tailored landing pages easily. Without any need for technical know-how.\n\nHere are some of our favorite features on this app:\n\nA drag-and-drop interface for easy customization, including form builders\nOver 400 customizable page templates to choose from\nPlugins to keep your landing pages on your servers\nGlobal cloud hosting to enhance that all-important page speed\nA/B testing to optimize your page and campaign performance\nSmart Sections feature that updates up to hundreds of pages with one click\nMonitoring of traffic flow from your landing pages plus advanced testing techniques\n\nHere’s how easy it is to use the Landing Page Builder to set up and publish a high-converting landing page with zero coding skills.\n\nGo to the Semrush App Center and start typing “Landing Page Builder” in the search box. Click “Landing Page Builder” when it appears.\n\nThen, hit the “Go to app” button.\n\nNext, click “Create your first landing page.” Or \"+ Create new landing page\" if you’ve used the tool previously.\n\nChoose your landing page goal from the left-side column.\n\nThen, select a template based on your landing page objective. For example, let’s choose a landing page template to get visitors to sign up for a webinar.\n\nYou can hover your mouse over a template and click “Preview” to have a look before choosing it.\n\nClick “Use template” in the top right of the screen to start building your page.\n\nIn the template example below, you can switch between two tabs to preview both the main and the “Thank you”page first. \n\nNow, type in your landing page name and click “Start editing.”\n\nYou can begin customizing as soon as the builder editor loads. By adding and changing elements like copy and images to match your preferences. \n\nDrag and drop elements from the left sidebar menu to include them on your landing page. \n\nThen, click on a specific element to edit it. You can also specify the element’s settings from the right sidebar menu. \n\nTip\n\nOne of the most critical elements to consider is your form. Ensure it’s straight to the point, asks for the user details you need, and has a clear submission button.\n\nWhen you’re done editing, you can preview, save, or publish your landing page. These buttons are in the top right of the app screen.\n\nClick on “Preview” to review your landing page one last time before publishing. This action automatically saves your landing page. \n\nYou can also switch between desktop and mobile views.\n\nClick “Back” to return to the editing page, then hit the “Publish” button.\n\nYou’ll see the live page’s shareable link.
