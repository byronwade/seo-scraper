  "content": "What Are Marketing Automation Tools?\n\nMarketing automation tools are software programs that streamline website monitoring, campaign management, ad retargeting, and other marketing processes. They reduce or eliminate the need for manual intervention, which can result in higher efficiency and fewer errors.\n\nIn 2023, research firm Ascend2 surveyed marketers to gain insight into how they use this technology.\n\nOf all respondents, 63% said they automate email marketing activities. And 50% reported automating social media management. The next most common uses for marketing automation tools were:\n\nPaid advertising\nContent management\nLanding pages\nSMS marketing\nCampaign monitoring\nAccount-based marketing (ABM)\nPush notifications\nLive chat\n\nAdditionally, 25% of marketers said their customer journey was \"mostly\" automated, and 44% said it was \"partially” automated. While 10% managed to fully automate their operations in this area.\n\nThese tools have numerous benefits, from improved productivity to increased customer satisfaction. It all comes down to how you use them. \n\nBenefits of Marketing Automation Tools\n\nAutomating marketing processes isn't just about business efficiency. It can also improve lead nurturing and boost customer satisfaction through:\n\nA better omnichannel experience\nPersonalization at scale\nFaster response times\nImproved sales and marketing alignment\n\nFor example, say you run an online store. \n\nWhen someone places an order, you can use this technology to recommend complementary products or offer a discount on future purchases.\n\nGo one step further and leverage email marketing automation tools to send personalized thank-you emails. You can also set up automated workflows to enroll buyers in loyalty programs based on their total spending.\n\nSuch initiatives can improve the customer experience and drive repeat sales.\n\nBut that's not all.\n\nIn a 2021 survey, 49% of companies agreed that marketing automation saves time. An equal number of respondents said it enables personalized communications, and 37% saw an increase in conversion.\n\nOut of the companies surveyed, 45% said marketing automation tools can boost efficiency and ROI. Other advantages cited were higher-quality leads, greater customer loyalty, and increased website traffic.\n\nOn a similar note, 25% of the professionals surveyed by Ascend2 felt their marketing automation efforts were \"very successful.\" Seventy-five percent also agreed this technology makes it easier to create effective customer journey maps. \n\nTop 13 Marketing Automation Tools by Category\n\nTo keep things simple, we’ll focus on the four main types of marketing automation software: \n\nAll-in-one platforms\nEmail marketing automation tools \nSocial media marketing automation tools\nAI-powered marketing automation tools\n\nListed below are our top picks in each category. Let’s dive in. \n\nAll-in-One Marketing Automation Tools\nHubSpot Marketing Hub\n\nHubSpot Marketing Hub offers a full suite of tools for marketing teams, from live chat software to automated email sequences. You can also use it to create online forms, monitor website traffic, and manage your advertising campaigns—all in one place.\n\nFor example, you can set up a chat flow to connect website visitors with your marketing or sales team.\n\nWith this feature, users can automatically assign conversations to specific team members.\n\nFor instance, let’s say someone asks about a particular product via live chat. Their inquiry is redirected to the person in charge of that product line. This can improve customer response time and drive efficiency.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nHubSpot Marketing Hub provides everything you need to attract, nurture, and convert leads. Plus, you can start with a free plan that includes a landing page builder, ad management software, reporting tools, and other helpful features.\n\nWe also like its intuitive interface and the detailed instructions. You’ll see the exact steps needed to set up workflows, create email sequences, build web pages, and more.\n\nPricing\n\nHubSpot’s all-in-one marketing automation platform includes three subscription plans:\n\nFree\nStarter: $20/month per user\nProfessional: $890/month (three users)\nEnterprise: $3,600/month (five users) \nAdobe Marketo Engage\n\nAdobe Marketo Engage is an all-in-one B2B marketing automation platform with landing page templates, form editors, SEO tools, and other features.\n\nThis software program uses AI to create predictive content based on customers’ behavior, browsing history, and preferences.

And the drag-and-drop interface allows you to easily create graphs for your reports.\n\nThese features enable data-driven decisions. And can help you make the most of your marketing budget. \n\nPricing\n\nAdobe Marketo Engage features four subscription plans: \n\nGrowth\nSelect\nPrime\nUltimate\n\nThe cost of each plan depends on your database size. Adobe doesn’t display the prices on its site, so you’ll have to contact the company to get a quote.\n\nEmail Marketing Automation Tools\nActiveCampaign\n\nActiveCampaign's email and marketing automation platform features over 900 third-party integrations and 800 pre-built automations. Use this tool to A/B test your email newsletters, build advanced marketing sequences, and track interactions at every stage of the buyer's journey.\n\nIts intuitive interface and pre-built templates make it easier to create marketing emails, landing pages, and detailed reports. You can also segment your audience and send personalized content to each customer group.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nWith ActiveCampaign, setting up automated email sequences is a breeze. Easily segment, manage, and update your contacts, nurture them via personalized email messages, and gain insights in real time. \n\nPricing\n\nActiveCampaign offers four membership plans that can be customized based on your needs.\n\nFor example, the Lite plan appeals to solopreneurs with up to 1,000 marketing contacts. But if you have a larger customer base, you can add more contacts to your subscription plan for an extra fee.\n\nLite: $39/month\nPlus: $70/month\nProfessional: $187/month\nEnterprise: $323/month\nCampaign Monitor\n\nCampaign Monitor doubles as a marketing and email automation platform, offering dozens of tools for small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). It features a drag-and-drop email builder, 100+ fully customizable email templates, and real-time reporting capabilities.\n\nBelow, see how easy it is to use Campaign Monitor's email builder:\n\nAlso, users can automate just about every aspect of their email marketing campaigns, from audience segmentation to content delivery.\n\nFor example, you can set up an automated welcome email series and display dynamic content based on the user's location or other criteria. This practice allows you to personalize your marketing message, which can increase customer engagement and sales.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nCampaign Monitor's automation tools are easy to use, even for those with little technical knowledge. \n\nOn top of that, its email templates are fully responsive, so they look great on any device. They're organized by category, and you can customize them with just a few clicks.\n\nPricing\n\nChoose from three pricing plans based on your number of contacts and the features you need.\n\nIf you're just getting started and have up to 500 contacts, you'll pay the base rate for any of the plans selected. The cost will increase as your list grows.\n\nLite: $11/month\nEssentials: $19/month\nPremier: $149/month\nKlaviyo\n\nKlaviyo offers over 300 pre-built integrations, 100+ email templates, and 50+ signup form templates.

There's also the option to automate A/B testing.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThis powerful tool combines AI and automation to streamline email marketing. Crafting engaging subject lines and high-converting emails is a breeze, thanks to its AI-powered capabilities. \n\nYou can also integrate Klaviyo with your existing systems and marketing channels to get a full picture of your audience. This feature allows for more advanced targeting and highly personalized shopping experiences.\n\nPricing\n\nKlaviyo features three membership plans, including a free option for users with up to 250 contacts. Just like with Campaign Monitor, you can customize your subscription based on the size of your contact list.\n\nFreeplan: (up to 250 contacts)\nEmail: $20/month (251 to 500 contacts)\nEmail and SMS: $20/month (251 to 500 contacts plus 150 SMS/MMS credits)\nOmnisend\n\nOmnisend is quite similar to Klaviyo, as both platforms appeal to ecommerce businesses. \n\nHowever, Omnisend offers more customization options and features like browser push notifications and gamification tools. It also allows you to create and automate more complex workflows for a better omnichannel experience.\n\nUsers can go directly to the Automation page and select a pre-built workflow. Or, create one from scratch.\n\nThe platform also features customizable signup forms, audience segmentation tools, and professional-looking email templates.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nWhat we like most about Omnisend is its ease of use. Users can automate reporting, list segmentation, A/B testing, and other marketing processes with just a few clicks. Regardless of their technical know-how.\n\nPricing\n\nOmnisend has three subscription plans, including a free package for businesses with fewer than 250 contacts.\n\nFreeplan: (0-250 contacts)\nStandard: $16/month (up to 500 contacts)\nPro: $59/month (up to 2,500 contacts)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you can customize your subscription plan based on your list size.

Plus, you can add image alt text for accessibility and SEO, create hashtag groups, and preview your posts.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nWith Buffer, it’s easy to automate social media posting, scheduling, and reporting. The platform involves a low learning curve and has lots of great features. Such as a hashtag manager, link shorteners, and individual post analytics.\n\nIt also integrates seamlessly with over 30 third-party apps, including Mailchimp, Canva, OpenAI, and others. For example, connect it to Zapier to automatically send content from hundreds of other apps to Buffer.\n\nPricing\n\nBuffer offers a free subscription plan with limited features.

It lets you monitor your posts by profile, keyword, or location, offering the insights you need to optimize your campaigns. \n\nHere's what the dashboard looks like:\n\nOnce signed in, track the messages received across all platforms from a single inbox, which allows for faster response times. Go one step further and create chatbots to engage with your followers on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter).\n\nCreate custom workflows, automate link tracking, and use AI to uncover emerging trends. These capabilities can take the guesswork out of social media planning while reducing your workload.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nA notable feature is Sprout's Social Media Listening tool.

Next, select the social networks where you'll publish your post.\n\nLet's say you want to write an educational post on how to cut calories and then publish it on Facebook.\n\nAdd your topic, choose your settings, and click \"Create post.\"\n\nAs you can see, ContentShake AI generated three social media posts with hashtags, images, and emojis.\n\nChoose the version you like most or make edits as needed.

The app comes with a three-day free trial.\n\nWhat to Look for in a Marketing Automation Tool\n\nThese business tools can streamline your marketing efforts, but each has distinct capabilities.\n\nFor instance, all-in-one marketing automation platforms can handle just about every aspect of your campaigns. These usually have built-in tools for lead scoring, A/B testing, SEO, ecommerce, and more.\n\nA potential drawback is that you may end up paying for features you don't need. Also, all-in-one tools often involve a steep learning curve. So you may have to invest in employee training or outside help.\n\nThat said, consider the following when choosing a marketing automation solution. \n\nSpecialized vs. All-in-One Tools\n\nSpecialized software can help with specific aspects of a marketing strategy, such as content creation or social media planning. All-in-one platforms, on the other hand, offer a wide range of tools with different uses.\n\nIn general, all-in-one solutions are suitable for large enterprises. These have more complex needs than smaller companies and deal with large amounts of data. Plus, they have multiple teams and departments that collaborate on campaigns.\n\nWith an all-in-one marketing platform, large enterprises can manage their data in a centralized location. They can also connect their existing CRM and ERP systems to the platform to gain a holistic view of their marketing efforts.\n\nBut if you're a small or medium-sized business, you probably don't need all these bells and whistles. Think about what marketing tasks you want to automate. Then, choose a couple of tools accordingly.\n\nFor instance, SEO automation tools can streamline competitor analysis, reporting, website monitoring, and other routine tasks. This will give you more time to fine-tune your SEO strategy and focus on revenue-generating activities. \n\nFeatures and Capabilities\n\nCheck your marketing stack to determine what you need help with.\n\nFor example, you may want to automate repetitive tasks like posting on social media or sending out surveys. Or perhaps you're looking to automate specific workflows, such as cross-selling or upselling to potential customers.\n\nAlso, think about which features are most important to you. These may include:\n\nUser-friendly interface\nClear navigation\nAI assistance\nAnalytics and reporting\nLearning resources\n24/7 customer support\nScalability\n\nLook for digital marketing automation tools that can grow with your business. For instance, a scalable email marketing platform can handle increasing subscriber numbers. \n\nThe best marketing automation tools usually include several subscription plans. \n\nEach plan targets companies in different stages of growth, from startups to enterprises with a large customer base. This means you can switch to a more compressive plan as your business evolves. \n\nIntegration Capabilities\n\nSelect a marketing automation platform that integrates with your existing systems and apps.\n\nFirst, make sure it's compatible with your CRM—if you have one in place. Second, consider the following integrations, depending on which marketing tools you already use or plan to use soon:\n\nEmail service provider (ESP)\nEcommerce platform\nLive chat\nEnterprise resource marketing (ERP) system\nAccounting system\nContent management system\nAnalytics apps\n\nWith these integrations, you'll create a single source for your data and unlock new capabilities.\n\nFor instance, say you connect your CRM to an email marketing automation platform like Mailchimp.\n\nThe two systems will continuously exchange data, leading to better insights into customer behavior. This allows for a higher degree of personalization, which can result in more effective email campaigns.\n\nFurther reading: CRM Integration: What It Is, Why It Helps, and How to Do It \n\nPricing\n\nDigital marketing automation tools vary in price from $20 to $2,000+/month. The higher their complexity, the more you can expect to pay.\n\nHowever, many platforms include a free trial, so try them out before committing to a paid plan.\n\nAlternatively, start with free marketing automation tools like Zoho Campaigns, MailerLite, or SendPulse. These include a free basic plan with limited features, but you can upgrade later on.\n\nFor instance, MailerLite's free plan appeals to solopreneurs with up to 1,000 subscribers. Users can send up to 12,000 monthly emails and have access to basic automation tools, like an email builder.\n\nNote\n\nThe cost usually depends on the software's features, the number of users, and the size of your customer base. Check all pricing options to see what you'll pay if you exceed your plan's limits. \n\nLeverage Automation to Streamline Your Marketing Activities\n\nMarketing automation software can help you get things done faster—and often better. This technology takes the guesswork out of planning email campaigns, allowing for highly personalized messages. Plus, it provides actionable insights into campaign performance.\n\nIf you want to level up your marketing strategy,try out Semrush's marketing automation tools, such as ContentShake AI and Social Poster. Our apps can help you move customers further down the sales funnel and gain a competitive advantage. \n\nElevate Your Marketing Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
