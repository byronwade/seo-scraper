  "content": "What Is Review Schema Markup? \n\nReview schema is a type of structured data markup that provides search engines like Google with details about reviews and ratings for products, recipes, movies, and more.\n\nSearch engines may use this markup to display user reviews and ratings within search results.\n\nFor example, the first waffle recipe shown in the image below uses review schema to display user ratings in the form of stars.\n\nReview schema is one of the many types of schema markup that search engines like Bing and Google support and that is promoted by Schema.org. \n\nIn this guide, we’ll go through the benefits of using review schema, how you can add it to your website, and how to test your implementation.\n\nWhy Review Schema Is Important\n\nAdding review schema to your website is important because it allows you to leverage social proof to capture users’ attention in search results. It can be useful for showcasing reviews of your own products or recipes in search results, or when you’re reviewing things yourself.\n\nNote\n\nLocal Business and Organization schema types are no longer eligible for the star review feature in search results if the reviews are “self-serving.” This means the business or organization being reviewed controls the reviews. You can read more about what this means in this Google documentation.\n\nGetting Rich Snippets\n\nReview schema markup can visually enhance your listing in search engine results pages (SERPs) by displaying a set of yellow star ratings (usually from one to five). This creates what is known as a rich snippet (or rich result).\n\nThese yellow stars provide contrast to all the plain text found in search results. Catching the eyes of users. This is especially important in mobile search results, as the yellow stars take up a larger proportion of the overall screen space.\n\nNote\n\nUsing review schema does not guarantee that you will get a rich snippet in search results.\n\nSocial Proof\n\nAside from the potential visual enhancement in the SERP, using review schema and potentially getting a rich snippet in search results also adds social proof. Your product can have a star rating within the search results based on real user feedback.\n\nBoth the social proof and enhanced visual presence in search results can improve the chances of users clicking on your website and potentially making a purchase.\n\nThe SEO Benefits\n\nSchema is not a confirmed Google ranking factor. Adding review schema to your pages will not directly affect your rankings.\n\nHowever, review schema markup can help search engines better understand what your webpages are about. This could help Google understand what search queries are relevant to your content. \n\nAnd this could indirectly impact what queries your content appears in search results for. But there’s no guarantee. And it won’t impact where in those results your content ranks. Having helpful, high-quality content is far more important for ranking. \n\nBut you can still benefit from the potential for rich snippets. And these can have a measurable impact on important metrics such as your click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate. \n\nLet’s now look at how you can implement review schema on your website.\n\nReview vs. AggregateRating Schema Required Properties\n\nYou can add two types of review and rating schema to your webpages:\n\nSimple reviews: individual opinion provided by a user\nAggregate ratings: an aggregate of multiple user reviews\n\nThey both have specific required properties you must include if you want your webpages to appear as rich snippets in search results. Google’s documentation goes into detail about these requirements, and we’ll look at them below.\n\nSimple Reviews\n\nThe image below shows a simple review of an individual user rating a particular waffle cafe on Tripadvisor.com. Simple reviews like this help highlight an individual’s opinion about a product or service.\n\nNote\n\nBecuase Tripadvisor is a review website, it can get rich snippets for reviews about other businesses. These are not deemed “self-serving” reviews by Google.\n\nYou’ll commonly see this schema type used for editorial reviews of products, like tech, books, and movies. Like this example for a review of the 15-inch MacBook Air:\n\nSimple Review Schema Required Properties\n\nProperty\n\n\t\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nauthor\n\n\t\n\nCan be a Person or Organization\n\n\n\n\nitemReviewed\n\n\t\n\nCan be one of several valid types, including Book, Course, and Product\n\n\n\n\nitemReviewed.name\n\n\t\n\nThe name of the item being reviewed (Text)\n\n\n\n\nreviewRating\n\n\t\n\nThe rating provided in the review\n\n\n\n\nreviewRating.\n\nratingValue\n\n\t\n\nThe numerical quality rating for the item, which can be a number, fraction, or percentage (Number or Text)\n\nGoogle also recommends using the following properties:\n\ndatePublished (the date the review was published, using the ISO 8601 format)\nbestRating (if omitted, 5 is assumed by default)\nworstRating (if omitted, 1 is assumed by default)\n\nNote\n\nYou’ll need to use the bestRating/worstRating properties if you want to use a different scale than the default. Such as a percentage or rating out of 10.\n\nAggregate Ratings\n\nYou can use the AggregateRating schema when you want to take the average of a selection of ratings from different users.\n\nYou’ll also see this type of review schema on editorial reviews where readers can have their say, but it’s also commonly used for showing reviews of businesses on sites like Facebook and Yelp.\n\nThe image below shows the aggregate ratings of over 5,000 users for a waffle recipe on allrecipes.com:\n\nAggregateRating Schema Required Properties\n\nProperty\n\n\t\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nitemReviewed\n\n\t\n\nCan be one of several valid types, including Book, Course, and Product\n\n\n\n\nitemReviewed.name\n\n\t\n\nThe name of the item being reviewed (Text)\n\n\n\n\nratingCount\n\n\t\n\nTotal number of ratings for the reviewed item (Number)\n\n\n\n\nreviewCount\n\n\t\n\nThe number of reviewers (Number)\n\n\n\n\nratingValue\n\n\t\n\nThe numerical quality rating for the item, which can be a number, fraction, or percentage (Number or Text)\n\nNote\n\nBoth reviewCount and ratingCount specify the number of individual users who have either reviewed or rated the item. It is possible to use both interchangeably. However, it is recommended to use reviewCount when your users provide a written review along with a rating, and use ratingCount for all other scenarios.\n\nAs with the simple Review schema, Google recommends including bestRating and worstRating properties. If you don’t, Google will assume a 1-5 scale.\n\nNow that you know the required properties, let’s go through how to add each type of review schema to your website. Starting with simple Review schema markup.\n\nHow to Implement Review Schema on Your Website\n\nYou can add both types of review schema to your website in multiple ways.\n\nYou can do so manually, by copying and pasting the schema you generate (see examples below) into the <head> section of the relevant pages. \n\nOr you can use a schema plugin if you’re using a CMS like WordPress. There are also lots of schema generators out there that can make things easier if you’re a beginner. We’ll talk more about this later in the article. \n\nBelow is an example of simple Review schema that adds a four-star review to a waffle recipe page, using the required properties we discussed above. Google recommends using JSON-LD for schema markup, so that’s what we’ll use in all our examples below.\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n\"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\",\n\"@type\": \"Review\",\n\"itemReviewed\": {\n\"@type\": \"Recipe\",\n\"image\": \"https://www.example.com/waffles.jpg\",\n\"name\": \"Waffles\"\n},\n\"reviewRating\": {\n\"@type\": \"Rating\",\n\"ratingValue\": \"4\",\n\"bestRating\": \"5\",\n\"worstRating\": \"0\"\n},\n\"author\": {\n\"@type\": \"Person\",\n\"name\": \"Waffle Expert\"\n},\n\"datePublished\": \"2024-03-05\"\n}\n</script>\n\nNow, let’s see what AggregateRating review schema looks like.\n\nHow to Implement AggregateRating Schema on Your Website\n\nAs with the simple Review schema type above, you can implement AggregateRating schema on your website manually or with the help of plugins and schema generators.\n\nOnce again, we have a code snippet below that uses the required and recommended properties from earlier. In this case, we’re adding an aggregated rating of 8.6 across 5,500 user ratings for a different waffle recipe on www.example.com. \n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n {\n\"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\",\n\"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n\"itemReviewed\": {\n\"@type\": \"Recipe\",\n\"image\": \"https://www.example.com/more-waffles.jpg\",\n\"name\": \"More Waffles\"\n},\n\"ratingValue\": \"8.6\",\n\"bestRating\": \"10\",\n\"worstRating\": \"0\",\n\"reviewCount\": \"5500\"\n }\n</script>\n\nIn practice, unless you’re no longer accepting new reviews/ratings, you’ll ideally have a way of updating the ratingValue property as the number of reviews changes. You may need to use a plugin/API to do this for you (more on that later).\n\nNow let’s look at how you can nest review schema within other schema types.\n\nHow to Nest Simple Reviews and Aggregate Ratings\n\nTo enhance the readability of your code and make the main focus of the page clear to search engines, you can also nest simple reviews and aggregate ratings within other schema types.\n\nFor example, you can nest simple review schema inside product information as shown below:\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n\"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\",\n\"@type\": \"Product\",\n\"image\": \"https://www.example.com/waffle-iron.jpg\",\n\"name\": \"Waffle Iron\",\n\"review\": [{\n\"@type\": \"Review\",\n\"reviewRating\": {\n\"@type\": \"Rating\",\n\"ratingValue\": \"4\",\n\"bestRating\": \"5\",\n\"worstRating\": \"0\"\n},\n\"author\": {\n\"@type\": \"Person\",\n\"name\": \"Waffle Expert\"\n},\n\"datePublished\": \"2024-05-02\"\n}]\n}\n </script>\n\nAs you can see, the above code snippet begins by putting the product information as our main type, and then uses the “review” property to add the review details.\n\nSimilarly, you can nest aggregate ratings as shown below: \n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n\"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\",\n\"@type\": \"Product\",\n\"image\": \"https://www.example.com/another-waffle-iron.jpg\",\n\"name\": \"Another Waffle Iron\",\n\"aggregateRating\": {\n\"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n\"ratingValue\": \"7.4\",\n\"bestRating\": \"10\",\n\"worstRating\": \"0\",\n\"ratingCount\": \"367\"\n}\n}\n</script>\nHow to Add Review Schema at Scale\nAdding Schema Manually\n\nOnce you generate your review schema markup in the forms illustrated in the previous section, you can add it to the <head> section of your HTML pages. Either manually within your website’s files or by using a code snippet plugin within your CMS.\n\nBut instead of manually adding review schema markup to each individual page on your website, you can use the following two methods to deploy review schema at scale.\n\nUsing Schema Plugins\n\nDepending on your situation and preferences, you can use plugins to generate and/or implement your review schema.\n\nA Chrome browser plugin like Schema.dev helps you mark up review schema without writing any code. However, you will need to manually add it to your pages.\n\nIf you have a WordPress website, you can use plugins to generate and add the schema for you. One option is Schema Pro’s review schema implementation.\n\nIn addition to implementing review schema, WordPress plugins can also help you implement other structured data assets. Such as article, event, and video schema. \n\nGuidelines to Be Aware of\n\nNo matter how you add your review schema to your website, you need to abide by Google’s guidelines. These include:\n\nReviews and ratings should be easy to find on the page you’ve marked up\nIt must be immediately obvious to a user that the page contains review content\nReview information should be about a specific item rather than a category or list\nInclude aggregate ratings of multiple individual reviews\nDon’t aggregate reviews/ratings from other websites\nHow to Test Your Review Schema\n\nBoth before and after implementing your review schema, it’s a good idea to test that you’ve generated it correctly. \n\nBelow are two tools you can use to validate and test your schema. Both of them will highlight errors in your code, and you can use Google’s error documentation to learn how to fix them.\n\nSchema Markup Validator\n\nUse Schema.org's schema markup validator tool to validate your schema markup. The tool automatically highlights errors such as missing objects and names.\n\nYou can use this before you add the schema to your webpages to ensure everything is correct. By using the code snippet option, rather than entering the URL.\n\nRich Results Preview Testing\n\nGoogle’s Rich Results Test is another tool you can use to validate your review schema. Like Schema.org’s tool, you can use this both before you implement the schema (using the code snippet option) and afterward to make sure you’ve added it correctly. \n\nHow to Measure the Impact of Review Schema\n\nImplementing review schema on your website can have an impact on your click-through and conversion rates, and potentially an SEO impact as well. \n\nBut a lot of this relies on getting rich results in Google search. So how do you find out how well you’re performing after implementing review schema markup?\n\nMethod 1: Using the Semrush Organic Research Tool\n\nYou can use Semrush’s Organic Research tool to learn where your pages are appearing as rich results.\n\nNavigate to the Organic Research tool from the left-hand navigation.\n\nEnter the domain you want to analyze and click “Search.”\n\nOn the dashboard that appears, scroll down to the box named “SERP Features.” Click on the “Reviews” feature in the “Linking to domain” section.\n\nThis will take you to a dashboard with all keywords for which your website ranks with a review rich snippet. \n\nYou can use this tool to monitor the number of keywords for which you’re ranking with a review rich snippet after implementing review schema. If you don’t see growth in this number over time, double-check your implementations.\n\nHowever, the content on the pages also needs to be high quality for them to rank in SERPs. And you should follow other SEO best practices, too.\n\nTrack Your Review Snippets\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nMethod 2: Using Google Search Console\n\nYou can also use Google Search Console (GSC) to track the performance of your pages with rich results.\n\nTo find valid pages and those with errors, look under the “Enhancements” area of the menu on the left-hand side of your Google Search Console dashboard. As long as you have valid review snippets for the GSC property, an option to view a report will display here. \n\nIf you don’t see any review snippet option here after implementing your review schema (like the screenshot above), it could be due to one of the following reasons:\n\nYou may have incorrectly implemented the review schema\nGoogle hasn’t crawled those pages yet\nGoogle deems those pages as invalid for review snippets\n\nYou can also find a performance report to see both the clicks and impressions for each snippet. To see this report, first navigate to “Search results” under the “Performance” tab on the left-hand side.\n\nNext, add a search appearance filter by clicking the “+ New” button at the top. Choose “Search appearance…” from the menu that appears.\n\nA box will appear where you can select the rich snippets for which you want to filter results. As before, if you have valid pages with review snippets, the review snippet option will appear here. Click that option.\n\nIf you do have the review snippets option, click “Apply” to see a chart of clicks and impressions for all queries that led to review snippets appearing in the SERPs. You can then navigate to the pages report to see which pages have review snippets, along with clicks and impressions for each.\n\nMonitor Your Structured Data Implementation at Scale with Semrush\n\nIt can be challenging to manage and monitor the implementation of structured data (like review schema) for websites with lots of pages to mark up. Along with every other aspect of keeping your website optimized.\n\nThe Semrush Site Audit tool provides an easy way to get an overview of your website’s health—including finding errors in your structured data markup.\n\nFind and Fix Schema Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nSite Audit also helps you understand how many of your pages use markup and how many of those marked-up pages have invalid structured data assets.\n\nCheck for structured data issues—and perform 140+ other on-page and technical SEO checks—with a free trial.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
