  "content": "Want more awareness, traffic, leads, and sales? \n\nThen you need digital advertising in your marketing mix.\n\nThis guide explains what it is, why it’s important, and how to get started.\n\nWhat Is Digital Advertising?\n\nDigital advertising refers to online ads delivered through digital channels such as search engines, social media, websites, and mobile apps.\n\nThe goal of digital ads is often to reach your target audience and influence them to take a specific action. Like signing up for a newsletter or making a purchase.\n\nThis is different from the traditional advertising we’ve all been exposed to for decades.\n\nTraditional Advertising vs. Digital Advertising\n\nTraditional advertising is the old-school way of reaching audiences through offline media like TV, radio, newspapers, and magazines. \n\nIt’s usually expensive and hard to measure.\n\nDigital advertising is the modern way of reaching audiences. And has become more important than traditional advertising for many companies. \n\nLet’s see why.\n\nWhy Is Digital Advertising Important?\n\nDigital advertising is important because it allows you to connect with your target audience in ways that traditional media channels don’t.\n\nThink about it—digital platforms together have billions of users. So you can get your brand and message in front of a huge audience, beyond just local markets.\n\nYou also get the benefit of advanced targeting capabilities—you can zero in on specific user demographics, interests, and behaviors to serve your ads to just your ideal customers.\n\nTraditional advertising methods don’t allow for the same level of precision.\n\nOn top of this, digital ads don’t require a heavy advertising budget. You can get started with just a few hundred dollars and scale up from there.\n\nPlus, digital ads make it far easier for you to track progress, measure and attribute results, and improve on your marketing campaigns as you go.\n\nTypes of Digital Advertising\n\nDigital advertising comes in many different forms. Below, we’ve listed some of the major types and provided some specific digital ad examples.\n\nSearch Ads\n\nSearch ads are text-based ads that appear in search engine results when people look for relevant keywords and phrases.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nNow, if anyone clicks on this ad, the advertiser (in this case, booking.com) pays Google a small fee. This is known as the pay-per-click (PPC) model.\n\nSearch ads are great for capturing the attention of potential customers at the exact moment they’re showing interest in a particular topic, product, or service.\n\nFurther reading: How to Create an Effective PPC Strategy in 7 Steps\n\nSocial Media Advertising\n\nSocial media advertising is running ads on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn.\n\nThese platforms allow you to use different ad formats. Like sponsored posts, carousel ads, video ads, and stories.\n\nHere’s an example of a sponsored post on Instagram:\n\nBeyond the wide range of ad formats, social media platforms also allow for highly targeted advertising—thanks to the rich user data they have. \n\nYou can target users based on:\n\nLocation\nDemographics (age, gender, etc.)\nInterests and hobbies\nBehaviors like past purchases or site visits\nJob role, education level, and more\n\nFurther reading: The Beginner’s Guide to Social Media Advertising in 2024\n\nDisplay Advertising\n\nDisplay ads appear on websites and platforms users are browsing that are part of an ad network. \n\nMany marketers run these ads via the Google Display Network (GDN). Which is a powerful digital advertising service that allows businesses to display ads across a vast network of third-party websites and apps.\n\nThese ads are typically embedded within website content or displayed alongside it.\n\nLike this:\n\nDone right, these ads can be incredibly effective for increasing brand visibility and driving conversions.\n\nFurther reading: Display Ads: What They Are, Types, & How They Work\n\nVideo Advertising\n\nVideo advertising is an increasingly popular form of digital advertising. It’s often found on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.\n\nOn YouTube, these ads usually play before or during other videos.\n\nLike this:\n\nVideo ads are often effective because of their ability to grab attention and convey a message in a dynamic and engaging way.\n\nFurther reading: Video Advertising: What It Is & How to Get Started\n\nSponsored Content\n\nSponsored content refers to content promoting a brand that’s paid for and published by an advertiser.\n\nThe goal is to blend branded messaging into high-quality, relevant content that doesn’t feel like an overt advertisement.\n\nHere’s an example of a sponsored post for Visit Rwanda that was published on National Geographic:\n\nTo create sponsored content, you can find relevant publishers in your industry. And contact them directly from their website. \n\nMany sites have dedicated sponsored content rates and packages. \n\nInfluencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing leverages influential social media personalities to promote products, services, or brand messages.\n\nFor example, Purina worked with this Instagram creator to promote their cat food:\n\nInfluencer marketing works because it taps into the trust and credibility that social media influencers have established with their followers. \n\nFurther reading: Influencer Marketing: What Is It and How to Build a Solid Strategy\n\nTip\n\nThe Influencer Analytics app can help you find influencers and manage partnerships with them. And there’s a free trial available.\n\nAffiliate Marketing\n\nAffiliate marketing means working with publishers to promote your business in exchange for a commission on the resulting sales.\n\nFor example,this article from Wired contains affiliate links to mattress websites. So, if a reader clicks one and makes a purchase, Wired earns a commission.\n\nThe best part about affiliate marketing is that it’s performance-based and there’s no up-front cost involved. Meaning you only pay publishers if they generate sales for you.\n\nThere are lots of platforms out there that can help you get started with affiliate marketing. Some popular ones are GiddyUp, ShareASale, and ClickBank.\n\nThese platforms act as middlemen and connect you with publishers in your industry. So you can partner with them.\n\nHow to Create a Digital Advertising Strategy\n\nHere are the steps you need to follow to create a solid digital advertising strategy:\n\n1. Understand Your Audience\n\nFirst, you need to gain a deep understanding of your target audience.\n\nThis allows you to craft ads with relevant messaging and choose the best platforms to run them on.\n\nUse Semrush’s One2Target tool to learn about your target audience.\n\nOpen the tool, enter up to five competitors’ websites, and click “Analyze.”\n\n(Don’t worry that this is based on competitors. Their audiences reflect your target audience’s characteristics.)\n\nYou’ll see a lot of different information.\n\nFor example, the “Demographics” tab shows you the different age brackets your audience falls into and what their gender breakdown looks like.\n\nThis can help you tailor your ad language and tone to resonate with specific segments.\n\nFor instance, you may use more youthful language and visuals if the audience skews younger.\n\nThe “Socioeconomics” tab reveals your audience’s household size, income level, etc.\n\nThis information helps you craft ads that highlight products and/or services that make sense for their income levels and household needs.\n\nAnd the “Behavior” tab provides insights into where your audience spends time online. \n\nAnd what social media platforms they use. \n\nPlace your ads on those sites and platforms for the best visibility with your target audience.\n\nGet In-Depth Audience Insights\n\nwith Semrush One2Target Audience Research\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Set Goals\n\nThe next step is to set clear goals for your campaigns.\n\nSpecifically, decide exactly what you want to achieve with your advertising campaigns and by when. To give your advertising campaigns direction.\n\nConsider mapping out all this information:\n\nGoal: What you exactly you want to achieve\nDeadline: When you want to achieve results\nMetrics: How you’ll measure whether you were successful\nCritical success factors: A step-by-step overview of what needs to happen to achieve your goal\n3. Choose Your Advertising Mix\n\nOnce your goals are clear, the next step is to create a plan of action. And determine which advertising options you’re going to use.\n\nSearch ads? Social media ads? Display ads? Video ads? Affiliate marketing?\n\nDecide this based on your target audience, campaign objectives, and budget considerations.\n\nFor example, leveraging video ads on platforms like YouTube and TikTok could be effective if your goal is to increase brand awareness among a younger demographic.\n\nBut if your goal is focused on lead generation, search ads and affiliate marketing may allow you to reach people who are more ready to engage.\n\nHow you allocate budget across different channels is also important.\n\nFor instance, you may run YouTube ads, Facebook ads, and Google search ads. With search ads receiving the largest budget allocation due to its strong lead gen capabilities.\n\nConsider all these factors. So you can create a solid digital advertising plan.\n\n4. Measure Campaign Results\n\nWhen running campaigns, you need to track metrics to measure your performance.\n\nThis helps you identify areas for improvement. \n\nSome common metrics to look at include:\n\nReturn on ad spend (ROAS): the revenue generated from all your advertising expenditure\nCost per impression (CPM): the cost per thousand impressions (or views)\nClick-through rate (CTR): the ratio of clicks to impressions for your ad\nCost per click (CPC): the cost you paid when someone clicked on your ad\nConversion rate: the percentage of people who take a desired action (i.e., make a purchase or download a brochure)\nEngagement rate: the percentage of people who engage with your ad in some way relative to the number of impressions it received\n\nThe specific metrics you’ll evaluate depend on your goals and what types of ads you’re running.\n\nDigital Advertising Tools to Improve Your Campaigns\n\nDigital advertising tools are helpful for managing and optimizing your campaigns based on data.\n\nHere’s a roundup of the best tools:\n\nPPC Advertising Toolkit\n\nSemrush’s PPC Advertising Toolkit helps you plan, manage, and optimize your digital advertising campaigns.
