  "title": "9 Best Content Management Systems for SEO in 2024",
  "content": "SEO helps your website reach broader audiences online. And using an efficient content management system (CMS) will increase your chances of success. \n\nIn this article, we’ll review features to consider when choosing a CMS for SEO. We’ll also recommend the top nine CMS platforms to jumpstart your website’s SEO efforts.\n\nFeatures to Look for in a CMS for SEO\n\nWhen searching for SEO-friendly CMS platforms, focus on features that increase your site’s visibility and ranking.\n\nEach platform should include or integrate with tools that help you optimize your on-page and technical SEO.\n\nOn-page SEO: Includes elements you can see, like keywords, headings, internal links, and meta tags\nTechnical SEO: Includes metadata elements you can’t see. Think XML sitemap, robots.txt files, and canonical tags.\n\nHere are six top CMS features for SEO:\n\n1. Customizable Page Elements\n\nOn-page SEO elements help search engines interpret and rank your content.\n\nSo, look for a CMS platform that allows you to fine-tune these elements for greater online visibility.\n\nTailor on-page SEO elements to incorporate online best practices.\n\nFor instance:\n\nPage titles should match user intent and incorporate the correct target keywords. This can boost your content’s search engine visibility\n\nHere’s how a page title looks on a search engine results page (SERP):\n\nMeta descriptions can act as a brief content summary to influence click-through rates (CTR)\nImage alt text will help search engines understand your images’ context\n2. Internal Linking\n\nInternal links help search engines understand your website page hierarchy. And they improve the user experience (UX).\n\nAn SEO-friendly CMS will have built-in features to help automate your link building.\n\nLinking from one page to another lets search engines find all the related content you offer on a given topic. \n\nLike this:\n\nConnecting all related content improves your chances of ranking for relevant keywords. \n\nPlus, internal links enable users to navigate helpful content easily. Good UX means visitors are more likely to stay on your site for longer.\n\n3. Analytics Tools\n\nTracking and analyzing key SEO metrics helps you see how well your SEO strategy is working. \n\nLook for a platform with a dashboard that tracks these metrics regularly. You’ll be able to make decisions based on data. And identify areas for improvement.\n\nUnderstand whether your SEO efforts pay off by looking at metrics around:\n\nHow your website performs in search engines\nHow users interact with your content\nHow your SEO efforts translate into traffic and conversions\n\nFor example, analytics tools like the GA Google Analytics plugin provide real-time tracking and metrics reporting. \n\nThis GA4 plugin from WordPress allows you to track user engagement, traffic sources, conversion rates, and more for your website’s content.\n\n4. Mobile-Friendly/Responsive Design Options\n\nA mobile-friendly website adapts some features of your website to mobile devices.\n\nA mobile-optimized website does as much as possible to make your site mobile-friendly.\n\nA responsive website can adapt to any screen size.\n\nChoose a CMS with mobile-optimized or responsive themes and templates. This retains your website’s layout and functionality across mobile devices. \n\nIt’s also an SEO ranking factor. Google says this about mobile-first indexing:\n\nWhile it’s not required to have a mobile version of your pages to have your content included in Google’s Search results, it is very strongly recommended. These best practices apply to mobile sites in general, and by definition to mobile-first indexing.\n\nGoogle prioritizes mobile versions first when crawling your site. \n\nAnd since most internet users access content through mobile devices, you want to ensure your site is equipped to help you capture mobile organic traffic.\n\n5. SEO Plugins\n\nPlugins are extensions that add functionality to your CMS. They give you more control over your site’s features without having to tweak the code.\n\nSemrush’s SEO Writing Assistant plugin for WordPress helps you create easy-to-read content that’s optimized for search engines and UX.\n\nIt uses AI to ensure that website visitors find your content readable with a consistent tone of voice.\n\nIt also checks your content for plagiarism. Then suggests areas you can rephrase to improve your content’s quality and originality.\n\n6. Easy Redirection Tools\n\nRedirections improve UX by rerouting outdated or redundant links to existing pages on your site. \n\nMake sure you look for a CMS with easy ways to redirect one page to another. \n\nWhy? \n\nSo users (and search engine crawlers) don’t land on broken or duplicate content. \n\nCrawlers can’t crawl broken URLs. You risk losing your keyword rankings if there’s no redirection.\n\nAnd users who land on an outdated or broken page will likely bounce to another site.\n\nA CMS that uses a plugin like Yoast SEO’s Redirect Manager lets you set up a redirect. Like this:\n\nNext, we look at how the top SEO CMS platforms out there incorporate these key features. \n\nThe 9 Best CMS for SEO in 2024\n\nWe’ve compiled the list below to help you find the best SEO CMS for your needs.\n\nWe based our nine top picks on the key SEO functions outlined above and listed them in no particular order.\n\nThe CMS platforms included cover a variety of business needs.
