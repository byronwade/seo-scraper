Think social media, email, PPC, TV ads, and billboards. \n\nTake the skincare brand The Inkey List, for example.\n\nTheir marketing efforts include social media, out-of-home ads, influencer partnerships, and in-person pop-up events at local hotspots. \n\nWhy You Need a Multichannel Marketing Strategy\n\n53% of marketers struggle with building an effective strategy when launching multichannel marketing campaigns. \n\nHowever, multichannel campaigns using four or more digital channels can outperform single or dual-channel campaigns by as much as 300%. \n\nA well-defined multichannel marketing strategy helps you to:\n\nReach a larger, more diverse audience by tapping into the unique preferences of different target groups and customer segments\nBuild brand awareness and trust by giving you more frequent exposure across a range of channels\nBoost customer engagement by optimizing for each channel, and so create more targeted and meaningful interactions\nDrive more conversions by covering multiple channels, moving your customers through those touchpoints to reach a quicker conversion\nLearn more about your target audience by experimenting with different channels, tactics, and content to see what works best for your customers.\n\nOur State of Content Marketing campaign is a great example. \n\nWe spent months planning our efforts. We then created a data-driven report as a gated ebook, which we promoted (and repurposed) across multiple channels to maximize downloads. \n\nThose channels included social media and display ads, influencer partnerships, blog posts, webinars, email marketing campaigns, and sponsorships.\n\nThe result was over 100,000 visits, 18,000 report downloads, and excellent ROI—something we could only have achieved with a solid strategy. \n\nHow to Build an Effective Multichannel Marketing Strategy in 7 Steps\n\nSo, how can you put together your own effective multichannel marketing plan? \n\nHere are our 7 steps to success.\n\n1. Align Business Objectives with Your Marketing Strategy \n\nStart by setting clear goals for your marketing strategy. \n\nThese should directly align with overarching business objectives. Such as building brand awareness or generating sales.\n\nMake sure your objectives are SMART: specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound.\n\nFor example, if you’re looking to attract more leads in the next quarter, your goal might be: \n\n“In the next 3 months, we plan to increase the number of sales qualified leads (SQLs) coming from marketing campaigns by 20%, reaching 2,300 leads by the end of Q4.”\n\nNext, consider how each marketing channel will help you to achieve this goal. For instance:\n\nWe will create a gated content offer (e.g., an ebook) to attract initial marketing qualified leads (MQLs)\nWe will promote it through digital channels, including paid and organic social, to reach more users\nWe will then use email marketing to create personalized nurture workflows and convert these leads in sales qualified leads (SQLs)\n\nFinally, map each channel in your strategy to a specific goal-related outcome—be that revenue growth, brand visibility, or customer loyalty. \n\n2. Conduct Deep Audience Analysis\n\nThe foundation of any successful multichannel marketing strategy is a deep understanding of your audience. \n\nKnowing where your leads spend their time online helps you to focus your efforts on the most impactful channels.\n\nHere's how you can understand your audience:\n\nStudy your existing customers: Use your CRM data and surveys to analyze their demographics, interests, and behaviors.\nUse social listening: With tools like Brand Monitoring, you can monitor conversations about your brand and industry on social media to understand your audience's pain points.\nConduct surveys and interviews: Gather direct feedback from your potential customers to understand their needs and expectations.\nLeverage audience research tools: Tools like One2Target can provide valuable information about your audience's online behavior, interests, and demographics.\n\nLet’s look at an example.\n\nHead to One2Target to generate audience insights in just a few clicks.\n\nSimply enter your (or your competitors’) website domain(s), and click “Analyze”.\n\nNext, explore the key tabs for a breakdown of the audience insights. \n\nOne2Target will generate information about their demographics, favorite communication channels, behavior, and more.\n\n3. Select and Prioritize Your Marketing Channels\n\nNext, decide which channels you want to tackle with your campaigns. \n\nLook at your audience preferences and analyze historical performance data. \n\nFor example, have you noticed if paid media performs best for conversions? Or, perhaps you’ve seen that a specific type of email nurturing increases engagement?\n\nUse this information to inform your channel selection. Here are some key metrics to consider:\n\nCustomer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Lower CAC indicates a more cost-effective channel\nCustomer Lifetime Value (CLTV): Higher CLTV suggests a channel attracts valuable customers\nConversion Rate: Focus on channels with higher conversion rates to drive sales\nReturn on Investment (ROI): Prioritize channels that generate a strong ROI\n\nThere are many tools for analyzing channel performance. \n\nFor example, you can use Google Analytics (GA4) to find out how different traffic sources contribute to conversions.\n\nOnce you understand which channels perform the best, prioritize them in your campaign. \n\nFor instance, choosing channels that convert at the highest rate will aid a sales-focused campaign.\n\n4. Craft a Unified Messaging Strategy \n\nA messaging strategy defines the core ideas, values, and information you will share with your target audience. \n\nFor example, Nike’s “Just Do It” tagline communicates their core message: to empower individuals to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals.\n\nSource:\nKnows Digital\n\nTo devise your own messaging approach, use this message map template from Wynter: \n\nHere’s how:\n\nList your audience’s pains and motivations (from step 2 above)\n\nFor example: Busy professionals struggle to manage tasks and feel overwhelmed by complex processes.\n\nWrite the core message\n\nFor example: “Get more done without stress” with our project management tool.\n\nHighlight key points\n\nFor example: Save time on routine tasks, automate communication, collaborate in real-time. \n\nAdd supporting points\n\nFor example: Use AI assistant for task prioritization, automatic requests, offline access.\n\nList examples, facts, testimonials\n\nFor example: Customer reviews, or statistics that demonstrate how the project management tool saves time.\n\n5. Personalize Your Messages Across Various Channels\n\nOnce you have defined your messaging concept, think about how to adjust it to suit different channels.\n\nOf course, your key message should be consistent across every platform.\n\nBut the tone of voice and formats you choose might vary, depending on what works for each avenue.\n\nLet’s use Nike as an example again. Their social media posts are energetic and community-driven. \n\nHowever, their print ads are bolder and more minimalistic.\n\nThey transmit the same message and personality, but take a different approach.\n\nHere’s how this could work for our fictional project management tool:\n\nSocial media: Anenergetic and humorous tone, with short and snappy captions, such as, “Tired of feeling overwhelmed by endless to-do? Our project management solution is here to save your sanity!”\nEmail marketing: A professional yet approachable tone, highlighting personalization and value-focused text. For example, “Our project management solution can boost your productivity by 30%.”\nWebsite banners: A simple and direct tone, with strong visuals and prominent CTAs. for instance., “Get your work done 10x faster.”\n6. Set Up Your Multichannel Marketing Campaign\n\nNext, take care of the technical setup of your campaigns. \n\nImagine you want to run ads on various channels.\n\nYou’ll need to use different platforms to upload campaign creatives, manage budgets, and track the results.\n\nAlternatively, you could use specialized tools like Semrush’s Ads Launch Assistant. It lets you manage Meta Ads (Facebook, Instagram) and Google Ads in one place.\n\nFirst, navigate to the tool and log in or sign up.\n\nNext, connect your Google Ads and Meta Ads accounts. \n\nFrom here, start adding your campaign details, such as the target URL, the campaign description, the daily budget, and so on.\n\nAds Launch Assistant will also generate customized ad variants for you and help you set up targeting.\n\nOnce you’re ready to go, review the suggested ads and launch your campaign with one click.\n\n7. Measure Performance Data Across Channels \n\nContinuously tracking your cross-channel campaign performance will help you get better results over time. \n\nIt also lets you determine which channels, content, and messaging work best, with such performance metrics as:\n\nWebsite traffic\nOn-page engagement rates\nClick-through rates\nConversion rates\nCustomer acquisition cost (CAC)\nCustomer lifetime value (CLTV).\n\nFor example, you can use Ads Launch Assistant to analyze your paid campaign performance in a particular place. \n\nIt will consolidate data from your Google Ads and Meta campaigns and help you quickly spot high- and low- performing strategies. \n\nUse it to examine your conversions and clicks and spot important patterns and trends. You may find that certain creatives, targeting settings, or budget setups tend to work best for your campaigns.\n\nKey Features of a Strong Multichannel Marketing Strategy\n\nSo, what are the key features of a successful multichannel marketing strategy?\n\nLet’s have a look.\n\n1. High-Quality Integrated Customer Data\n\nWith multiple marketing channels in use, it can be difficult to keep track of your campaigns.\n\nYou may have a clear overview of what’s happening on each channel.\n\nBut you might also struggle to get a holistic picture with data housed across different tools and platforms. \n\nIn this case, you could try a CDP (customer data platform) to collect details on customers from various sources and create personalized campaigns. \n\nHere's an explanation of how it works:\n\nCDPs like Segment and Bloomreach help you track customer actions and tailor marketing acitivites based on user characteristics and behavior. \n\n2. Consistent Cross-Channel Messaging\n\nIt’s important to maintain a consistent message across channels. This helps you build trust and tell an engaging story.\n\nTo do this, you should:\n\nDevelop clear brand guidelines: Define your brand voice and key brand personality traits. This acts as a north star for all your marketing efforts.\nCreate a single campaign brief: Ensure everyone involved in your multichannel campaign understands the core message and target audience.\nCentralize communication: Use a project management tool like Notion to keep everyone on the same page and avoid mismatched messaging.\n\nFor instance, take a look at how Semrush’s marketing team came up with the powerful message behind our Gaby campaign.\n\n3. Smart Automation and AI Tools\n\nTo manage your campaigns efficiently, use marketing automation and AI tools to streamline and personalize your content creation.\n\nFor example, our Ads Launch Assistant has a suite of AI features that can help you:\n\nGenerate high-quality ad copy and keywords tailored to your target audience, saving you time and effort.\nGet expert recommendations on campaign settings and optimization strategies to improve your results.\nMonitor your campaigns across Google and Meta from a single dashboard, for valuable insights to refine your approach.\n\nAnother great example is ContentShake AI. \n\nThis AI writing tool automates content creation for your SEO and social media efforts.\n\nFor example, it can help you write blog posts optimized to rank in search. \n\nIt can also create engaging social media posts to promote your content on Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), and more.\n\n4. A Functional Marketing Attribution Model\n\nMarketing attribution assigns credit to the marketing channels and touchpoints that influence a customer's decision to convert.\n\nThis helps you understand which channels and assets contribute to the ultimate success—and iterate accordingly.\n\nFor example, marketing attribution shows you whether a customer who purchased your product entered the marketing funnel through a specific ad or social media post.\n\nHere are the key types of attribution models:\n\nLast-click attribution gives all the credit to the final interaction before a conversion\nFirst-click attribution assigns all the credit to the initial touchpoint. \nMulti-touch (or linear) attribution distributes credit across all touchpoints, helping you understand the combined impact of various channels.\n\nFor multichannel campaigns, the linear attribution model is often the best choice because it assigns equal credit to all touchpoints in the customer journey. \n\nThis helps you get a balanced view of how each channel contributes to conversions.\n\nCraft a Stellar Multichannel Marketing Strategy \n\nWith a well-planned multichannel marketing strategy, you can amplify your reach, boost engagement, and increase conversions. \n\nWhen building out your multichannel strategy, remember to:\n\nSet SMART goals that align with business objectives\nConduct thorough audience analysis \nSelect and prioritize your marketing channels based on individual performance and multichannel synergy\nCraft a unified messaging strategy\nAdapt your message for each channel while maintaining consistency \nSet up end-to-end analytics to continuously track performance and optimize your efforts. \n\nReady to give it a try?\n\nTry Semrush’s Ads Launch Assistant to create high-performing multichannel ad campaigns in a couple of clicks.\n\nLaunch Winning Google and Meta Ads\n\nwith Ads Launch Assistant by Semrush\n\nStart for FREE →",
