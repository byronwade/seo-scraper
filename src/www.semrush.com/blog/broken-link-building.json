  "content": "What Is Broken Link Building?\n\nBroken link building is the process of finding dead links on other websites and convincing web admins to replace them with working links to your website.\n\nA link is “broken,” “dead,” or “invalid” when it points to a page that’s inaccessible. \n\nLike this:\n\nUsually, you’ll look for links to external pages that return 404 Not Found errors. This HTTP status code indicates that the page was deleted. You can offer the linking site an alternative resource to link out to.\n\nHowever, you can look for other kinds of broken links. And work to inherit them.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Broken Link Building?\n\nBroken link building can be an effective way to earn links from external domains (known as backlinks). \n\nIn addition to driving valuable referral traffic, backlinks can benefit your SEO. Because Google treats certain types of backlinks like votes of confidence. \n\nThe higher the quality and quantity of backlinks you have, the more authoritative your site is perceived to be. And that can lead to higher search engine rankings.\n\nBroken link building can have a higher success rate than other link building tactics. Because you’re helping web admins solve an issue on their site. And providing a reason to link to you. \n\nPlus, the strategy can help you:\n\nEarn backlinks on pages with established traffic and authority\nInherit links that previously pointed to competitors\nGenerate link bait ideas (i.e., link-worthy content ideas) \nHow to Do Broken Link Building\n\nLearn how to do broken link building step by step:\n\nIdentify Your Broken Backlinks\nIdentify Competitors’ Broken Backlinks\nEvaluate Link Opportunities\nIdentify Outreach Contacts\nSend Your Pitch\n\nLet’s get started.\n\n1. Identify Your Broken Backlinks\n\nStart by finding dead links that were supposed to point to your website in the first place (i.e., broken backlinks). \n\nIn these cases, you’re more likely to have a viable alternative link. And the admin is more likely to update the link in your favor.\n\nFind broken backlinks with Semrush’s Backlink Audit tool.\n\nEnter your domain and click “Start Backlink Audit.”\n\nThen, follow the prompts to configure the Backlink Audit tool.\n\nOnce your backlink audit is ready, go to the “Audit” tab. \n\nCheck the box next to “Target URL error.”\n\nThis filters for backlinks that point to 4xx (Client Error) or 5xx (Server Error) pages on your website.\n\nNext, go to the “Toxicity Score” filter and select “0-44 Non-toxic.”\n\nThis filters out potentially harmful backlinks. Restoring these potentially harmful broken backlinks could harm your site.\n\nYou now have a list of broken backlinks that could be worth fixing.\n\nExport the results using the “Export to CSV” button. \n\nYou can now jump ahead to step three. Or find your competitors’ broken backlinks first.\n\nTip: Use Semrush’s Link Building Tool to find and recover lost backlinks. This includes broken and removed backlinks. \n\nFind Broken Backlinks’\n\nwith the Backlink Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Identify Competitors’ Broken Backlinks\n\nWhen you find competitors’ broken backlinks, you have an opportunity to “steal” them.\n\nThere are two main methods:\n\nAnalyze Your Competitors’ Backlink Profiles\nCheck for Broken Links on Resource Pages\n\nLet’s explore each tactic step by step.\n\nAnalyze Your Competitors’ Backlink Profiles\n\nWith Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool, you can review your competitors’ backlink profiles. And filter for links to broken pages.\n\nTo start, enter your domain and click “Analyze.”\n\nClick “...” then “Competitors.”\n\nThe tool provides a list of “Domain Competitors.”\n\nThis is based on the number of referring domains pointing to each competitor and the number of referring domains you have in common.\n\nGenerally, the more backlinks you already share, the better your chance of inheriting their broken backlinks.\n\nClick on the top competitor’s domain to explore their backlinks.\n\nThen, go to the “Indexed Pages” tab.\n\nAnd apply the “Broken Pages” filter. \n\nYou’ll see a list of 4xx and 5xx pages on the competitor’s site. \n\nClick the number in the “Backlinks” column to see a breakdown of backlinks to each one.\n\nFilter for “Active” backlinks. Then export your results.\n\nRepeat this process for other pages and competitors. And combine your exported data in one spreadsheet.\n\nYou’ll analyze your opportunities in step three.\n\nFind Competitors’ Backlinks\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nCheck for Broken Links on Resource Pages\n\nSome websites have resource pages that contain useful links to external websites. \n\nIf these pages contain dead links, you might be able to inherit them. (Along with any other links to the broken pages.)\n\nFind resource pages using Google. \n\nGoogle search operators can help narrow your search. Here are some templates:\n\n“useful links” AND [topic]\n[topic] intitle:“useful resources”\n[topic] inurl:resources\n\nFor example:\n\nUse an extension like Check My Links to find invalid links on resource pages.\n\nLook for broken backlinks you could inherit. Ones that are relevant to your brand.\n\nTo find out if the broken page has other backlinks you could pursue, copy the broken URL. \n\nThen, paste it into Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool and click “Analyze.”\n\nThe “Backlinks” tab shows a list of backlinks to the broken page.\n\nUse the “Export” button to save your results in a spreadsheet. You’ll evaluate them in the next step.\n\nFind Competitors’ Backlinks\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Evaluate Link Opportunities\n\nNext, evaluate and prioritize your broken link building opportunities. So you can use resources more effectively.\n\nOne consideration is the potential value of the backlink.\n\nGauge this with Semrush’s Authority Score (AS) metric. It measures the authoritativeness of a page or domain on a scale of 0-100.\n\nGenerally, the higher the referring page or domain’s score, the more valuable the backlink for SEO.\n\nSort the “Page AS” and “AS” spreadsheet columns into descending order. \n\nTip: For more ways to evaluate the potential value of a backlink, read our backlink analysis guide.\n\nNext, review each broken link in context. \n\nSimply open its source URL and find the hyperlinked element.\n\nTo find out what the linked page used to look like, enter the dead link into Wayback Machine.\n\nThen, click the date of the most recent snapshot. You can check earlier dates if you need to. \n\nWhen you open the snapshot, you can see the deleted page. And work to find a comparable resource on your website.\n\nConsider the alternative link you could recommend to the web admin. And the likelihood they'll accept your suggestion.\n\nThe web admin is more likely to link to your site if:\n\nYour suggested link is relevant and useful in context\nYour suggested page is the best of its kind\nTheir page gets ample traffic\nLinking to your site presents no conflict of interest\nThe original link was supposed to point to your site\n\nTip: Maximize your chance of success by improving your content. Or creating quality content from scratch. But you’ll need to weigh the potential benefits against the effort required.\n\nConversely, the web admin is less likely to link to your site if:\n\nThey can easily find a better alternative\nTheir content is outdated (e.g., an old news article)\nLinking to your site presents a conflict of interest (e.g., you’re a competitor)\nThe original link was sponsored or pointed to a partner site\nThe original link appears within user-generated content (e.g., a forum comment)\n\nIn these cases, the admin might decide to link elsewhere, leave the dead link in place, or remove it altogether.\n\nSo, pursuing these broken link building opportunities could do more harm than good. You’ll waste time and potentially harm relationships with useful contacts.\n\nDecide whether the opportunity is worth pursuing and add notes to your spreadsheet.\n\nLike this:\n\nWhen you’re ready to pursue one or more opportunities, move to the next step.\n\n4. Identify Outreach Contacts\n\nOutreach is the process of contacting web admins (usually via email) and requesting that they link to your site. \n\nIn broken link building, the idea is to point out the broken backlink. And offer your alternative.\n\nFirst, determine whom to contact. \n\nStaff writers typically have the motive and power to update dead links. Open the source page’s URL to check for an author byline.\n\nYou might need to check the writer’s author page or social media profiles to learn more about them.\n\nLet’s say you’re pursuing a broken link building SEO opportunity in this article:\n\nNatasha’s author page shows that she’s a staff writer. And even includes her email address.\n\nYou could even try direct messaging her on Twitter.\n\nIf that tactic doesn’t work, check the site’s “Contact” or “Meet the Team” page.\n\nLook for a specific contact (a particular person’s email address) rather than a generic email address (like hello@example.com). Direct requests to the most relevant person are more likely to succeed.\n\nTip: For help finding an email address, try Prowly. The tool’s media database contains over 1 million contacts. And you can search by name or website.\n\n5. Send Your Pitch\n\nNext, write and send your pitch. \n\nAdmins are often receptive to broken link building emails. After all, you’re bringing their attention to an issue on their website. And providing a suggestion to help them fix it.\n\nYou’ve ensured your alternative link is a good fit and identified the right contact. All that’s left is making a clear, friendly, and compelling proposal.\n\nHere are some best practices:\n\nStart with a personalized greeting\nReference the broken link upfront\nExplain why your link makes a good alternative\nInclude hyperlinks for easy reference\nKeep your email concise\n\nHere’s a broken link building email example:\n\nHi Michael,\n\nI noticed your Dunder Mifflin article “How to Make Your Office More Economical” contains a broken link.\n\nLooks like EcoMag deleted their paper recycling report, as the URL brings up a 404 error.\n\nIf you’re looking for an alternative, we’ve just published a new paper waste report here at WasteCo.\n\nWe found that offices recycle just 40% of paper on average!\n\nKind regards,\n\nLesley\n\nAfter sending your email, keep an eye out for a reply. Or an update to the broken link.\n\nIf there’s no change after three working days, follow up in the original email thread. Just ask the contact whether they’ve had a chance to consider your proposal.\n\nAlternatively, simplify the entire broken link building process using Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nAfter setting up your campaign and connecting your email account, head over to the “In Progress” tab.\n\nScroll down and click “Import.”\n\nSelect “General” as the outreach strategy.\n\nEnter the referring domains selected for broken link building and click “Add” > “Add new domains.”\n\nNext, find the site you want to email and click “Contact.”\n\nOn this page, you’ll draft a broken link building outreach email.\n\nYou can even save it as a template.\n\nOnce you’ve written the email, click “Send and proceed to next.”\n\nThe tool will automatically update the “Status” column.\n\nYou can see whether your email has been sent, delivered, read, or replied to. \n\nIdeally, you’ll eventually see the notification, “Backlink earned.”\n\nGo to the “Monitor” report to learn more about your backlink and ensure it remains active.\n\nTip: Semrush’s Link Building Tool finds other link building prospects based on your target keywords and competitors.
