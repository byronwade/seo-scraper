  "content": "What Is Keyword Stuffing?\n\nKeyword stuffing is a spammy SEO tactic that involves unnaturally forcing keywords into webpages. With the aim of ranking higher on the search engine results page.\n\nFor example, the main content might read like this:\n\nKeyword stuffing may also occur in the following places:\n\n1. Title tags and meta descriptions (which can be used to generate search engine snippets):\n\n2. URLs (webpage addresses):\n\n3. Anchor text (text that hyperlinks are attached to):\n\n4. Alt text (HTML image descriptions used by screen readers and search engines):\n\nIt’s normal for keywords to occur and reoccur within content.\n\nBut as our keyword stuffing examples show, it’s unhelpful to place them excessively or unnaturally. \n\nHow Keyword Stuffing Affects SEO\n\nKeyword stuffing is bad for SEO because it leads to poor-quality content. \n\nUnnatural keyword usage looks spammy. This can discourage users from interacting with your page or link and harm your brand image.\n\nAlso, Google rewards high-quality, person-first content. Meaning if you purposefully stuff a webpage with keywords, it’s unlikely to rank well.\n\nKeyword stuffing also violates Google’s spam policies.\n\nIf Google detects that you’ve:\n\nStuffed keywords into on-site content (especially at scale) or\nBuilt backlinks (links to your site from other sites) that use overly keyword-rich anchor text across various domains\n\nYou may see your rankings suffer. Or even receive a manual action (also known as a Google penalty). This means that your site will be suppressed or removed from Google search results.\n\nWhy Websites Use Keyword Stuffing\n\nWebsites use keyword stuffing in a misguided effort to earn higher SEO rankings.\n\nIn the early days of SEO, keyword stuffing could lead to higher rankings.\n\nGoogle’s algorithm treated pages with keywords—or more repetitions of the keyword—as more relevant. And gave weight to keyword-rich backlinks.\n\nGoogle has since rolled out numerous algorithm updates to devalue or penalize keyword stuffing.\n\nWhich means Google understands context and currently ranks pieces based on factors like comprehensiveness and search intent. Rather than how many times you use a keyword.\n\nAlso, Google’s current web spam detection systems are highly effective. So keyword stuffing will hurt your performance in search results.\n\nThat being said, Google does look for search terms on pages to determine whether they’re relevant to the user:\n\nThe most basic signal that information is relevant is when content contains the same keywords as your search query. For example, with web pages, if those keywords appear on the page, or if they appear in the headings or body of the text, the information might be more relevant.\n\nGoogle\n\nAnd does use anchor text to understand what linked pages are about.\n\nBut you don’t need to use a keyword on a page a certain number of times to rank for it. Or have numerous incoming links with keyword-rich anchor text.\n\nHow to Identify Keyword Stuffing\n\nYou can manually identify keyword stuffing by reading your content. And checking for the excessive or unnatural placement of keywords.\n\nIf you want to bulk analyze content for keyword stuffing, some SEO tools will scrape content (e.g., all your alt text) and export it to a spreadsheet.\n\nBut this can still be a time-consuming and subjective process. So, let’s learn how to speed things up with two Semrush tools: On-Page SEO Checker and Backlink Audit. \n\nAnalyze Your Site with Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker\n\nTo check your on-site content more efficiently, import your pages and their target keywords into Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker.\n\nThe tool calculates keyword density (i.e., what proportion of words are keywords) in the following tags:\n\n<body>: The body tag, which should contain your main content\n<h1>: The H1 tag, which should contain your on-page title\n<meta>: The meta tag, which should contain a page description\n<title>: The title tag, which should contain your off-page title\n\nThen compares your keyword densities against your top-ranking rivals’ keyword densities. To see whether there’s a disparity.\n\nThe tool also compares many other on-page SEO factors. And provides recommendations accordingly.\n\nAfter setting up, scroll down to “TOP pages to optimize.” And click “# ideas” alongside your highest-priority page.\n\nGo to the “Content” section to see whether your page has stuffed keywords.\n\nIf not, you’ll see a note like this:\n\nIf yes, you’ll see a recommendation like this:\n\nClick “See detailed analysis” for a keyword usage breakdown.\n\nIf your keyword density is significantly higher than top-ranking competitors’, rewrite your content. Making sure to use keywords more naturally.\n\nDon’t forget to apply the other optimization ideas, too.\n\nTip\n\nYou can also check for keyword stuffing as you write with the SEO Writing Assistant. It calculates keyword density and highlights instances where you might be using your target keyword too many times.\n\nIdentify Keyword Stuffing\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\nCheck Backlinks for Keyword Stuffing\n\nTo check your backlinks for over-optimized anchor text, use Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool.\n\nEnter your domain and click “Analyze.”\n\nThen, go to the “Anchors” report. And check the “Anchor Text” column for keyword-rich anchor texts.\n\nAlternatively, use the “Filter by anchor” feature to focus on particular terms.\n\nThe potentially riskiest anchors are:\n\nMoney anchors, which exactly match a keyword you’re trying to rank for\nCompound anchors, which contain your brand name with another word or term\n\nIf you have too much keyword-rich anchor text across multiple domains, these backlinks could do more harm than good. Particularly if you have a disproportionately large percentage of keyword-rich anchors compared to other kinds of anchor text.\n\nCheck out our toxic backlink guide for advice on dealing with this problem.\n\nPro tip\n\nYou can also analyze your competitors in Backlink Analytics. To see how their backlink anchor texts compare to yours.\n\nAnalyze Backlink Anchor Text\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Avoid Keyword Stuffing\n\nHere are four tips to help you avoid keyword stuffing:\n\n1. Focus on a Handful of Keywords Per Page\n\nIt’s harder to avoid keyword stuffing if you target every keyword that’s relevant to your page.\n\nTo give you an idea, over 30,000 keywords in the U.S. contain “cheap” and “shoes.” According to Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool:\n\nKeyword analysis allows you to prioritize keywords based on numerous factors, including:\n\nSearch intent: The purpose behind the user’s search\nKeyword difficulty: How hard it will be to earn a high organic ranking\nSearch volume: The average number of searches per month\n\nFor each page, we recommend that you pick one primary keyword (the main keyword you want to target).\n\nAnd one to five secondary keywords (other keywords you want to target). The larger the scope and depth of your content, the more secondary keywords you can safely include.\n\nFurther reading: How to Do Keyword Research for SEO\n\n2. Follow On-Page SEO Best Practices\n\nOn-page SEO best practices are tried-and-tested ways to help your webpages rank higher.\n\nLet’s look at some key do’s and don’ts:\n\nDo focus on creating content for users, not search engines\nDo include your primary keyword in the title tag, meta description, H1, and first paragraph of body content\nDo use related keywords and keyword fragments to make your content read more naturally\nDo use secondary keywords in the body content and subheadings, where relevant\nDo write descriptive alt text for images and incorporate keywords where relevant\nDo use descriptive anchor text for links and incorporate keywords where relevant\nDon’t use grammatically incorrect keywords (e.g., “cheap shoes men”)\nDon’t force in keywords where they don’t make sense\nDon’t try to achieve a particular keyword density\nDon’t use lots of similar keywords in close succession\nDon’t write about an irrelevant subtopic just to target a keyword\n\nYou can also learn a lot by analyzing the top-ranking pages for your target keyword.\n\nSemrush’s SEO Content Template makes it easy.\n\nEnter your target keyword(s), choose your audience, then click “Create content template.”\n\nThe tool will analyze the top 10 unpaid results for your target keywords.\n\nTo provide a variety of recommendations:\n\nYou can even see how competitors use your target keywords:\n\nThis information can help you construct an effective keyword optimization strategy.\n\nFurther reading: On-Page SEO Checklist\n\nCheck Rivals’ Keyword Usage\n\nwith the SEO Content Template Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Draft Your Content in Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant\n\nIf you draft your content in Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant, the tool highlights any overused keywords.\n\nLike this:\n\nYou can also check for keyword stuffing in the “SEO” section of the sidebar:\n\nThis allows you to fix issues you might have otherwise missed.\n\nThe SEO Writing Assistant also shows whether you’ve missed any target keywords.\n\nAnd suggests semantic keywords (conceptually related keywords) that can make your content read more naturally.\n\nIf you need help improving your draft, take advantage of the Smart Writer tools. \n\nYou can rephrase, simplify, expand, or summarize content in one click. Or ask AI a question.\n\nIn addition to following the tool’s recommendations, read your content aloud. To ensure it reads naturally.\n\nYou could also ask a teammate to edit your article.\n\n4. Choose Backlink Anchor Text Carefully\n\nWhen building links to your site, avoid stuffing keywords into the anchor text. \n\nOnly link to your site where it’s natural and helpful to do so. And choose anchor text with readers in mind—not search engines.\n\nHealthy backlinks include a variety of anchor text types, including:\n\nAnchor Text Type\n\n\t\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nBranded\n\n\t\n\nNike\n\n\n\n\nBrand + keyword\n\n\t\n\nNike sneakers\n\n\n\n\nExact match keyword\n\n\t\n\nsneakers\n\n\n\n\nPartial match keyword\n\n\t\n\nrange of sneakers\n\n\n\n\nRelated keyword\n\n\t\n\ncasual shoes\n\n\n\n\nNaked link\n\n\t\n\nhttps://www.nike.com/ \n\n\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\t\n\nclick here\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\t\n\n[Photo of Nike sneakers]\n\nOptimize Your Content with Semrush\n\nSemrush has all the tools you need to avoid keyword stuffing, create SEO-friendly content, and build quality backlinks, including:\n\nKeyword Magic Tool: Find the best keywords for any page\nOn Page SEO Checker: Learn how to improve your existing content\nSEO Content Template: Get SEO recommendations for new content\nSEO Writing Assistant: Check your content drafts in real time\nBacklink Analytics: Analyze your and your rivals’ backlink profiles\n\nSign up now to try them out.\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
