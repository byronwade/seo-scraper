You could search “dog beds” to see what your target audience wants to know about them.\n\nThe tool returns a wheel of questions. These are organized into types and color-coded by search volume.\n\nYou could choose the questions people ask the most to guide your content strategy. \n\nHow? \n\nBy creating standalone pieces for each query.

Google Analytics (GA)\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 (GA4) connects to your website to provide accurate information about how it performs in paid and organic search.\n\nFor example, in the screenshot below, you can see that 58,000 new users visited the site between January 17 and February 13. It also shows the total revenue the site generated ($79,000) in that period.\n\nThat information (much of which is only on GA) is essential for measuring the effectiveness of your SEO campaigns.
