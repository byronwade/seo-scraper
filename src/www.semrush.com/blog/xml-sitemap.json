  "content": "What Is an XML Sitemap?\n\nAn XML sitemap is a file that tells search engines like Google which URLs on your website should be indexed (added to its database of possible search results).\n\nIt may also provide additional information about each URL, including:\n\nWhen the page was last modified\nHow often the page is updated\nThe relative importance of the page\n\nThis information can help search engines crawl (explore) your site more effectively and efficiently. And better match your pages with relevant search queries.\n\nThat’s why XML sitemaps are important in search engine optimization (SEO).\n\nNote\n\nXML sitemaps are different from HTML sitemaps. An HTML sitemap is a page of links designed to help actual users navigate a website.\n\nWhat Does an XML Sitemap Look Like?\n\nAn XML sitemap (or sitemap.xml file) looks something like this:\n\nIt’s called an XML sitemap because it’s written in Extensible Markup Language (XML). \n\nIf you’re interested in the details, the main tags used are:\n\n<urlset>: Encloses all the tags for each sitemap\n<url>: Encloses all the tags for each URL\n<loc>: Specifies the page’s complete URL\n<lastmod>: Specifies when the page was last updated (optional) \n<changefreq>: Specifies how frequently the page is likely to change (optional) \n<priority>: Specifies the relative importance of the page from 0.0 to 1.0 (optional) \n\nNote\n\nGoogle ignores the <changefreq> and <priority> tags, so they may not be worth adding. And you should only use the <lastmod> value if you can ensure it’s always accurate.\n\nWebmasters can also create dedicated image, video, and news sitemaps. To help search engines understand these specific types of content.\n\nIf you need to create more than one sitemap, you need a sitemap index. Which essentially acts as a sitemap for your sitemaps.\n\nDo You Need an XML Sitemap?\n\nAn XML sitemap is highly recommended if you want your pages to show in search engine results.\n\nIf you don’t provide an XML sitemap, search engines have to rely on hyperlinks (on your own site or elsewhere) to discover pages on your site. This is inefficient and it can lead to pages being missed.\n\nNow, let’s learn how to create an XML sitemap.\n\nHow to Generate an XML Sitemap\n\nIt’s likely that the platform you use to manage your website’s content automatically generates and updates your XML sitemap. \n\nYou may be able to find yours by going to yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml in your browser.\n\nLike this:\n\n(This should work if you’re using WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or Shopify.)\n\nOtherwise, refer to the help center for your website builder or content management system (CMS). Or contact your platform’s support team.\n\nIf your platform doesn’t provide an XML sitemap, you can use a sitemap generator tool. \n\nThese tools can also prove helpful if you want more control over your sitemap. For example, you can customize your WordPress sitemap with the Yoast SEO plugin.\n\nIf you use a tool outside of your platform to create a sitemap, make sure to publish it to your site to make it live.\n\nTip\n\nSome platforms/tools let you manually edit your XML sitemap. This is useful if you want to remove certain URLs or add extra detail, but it’s important to exercise caution to avoid making mistakes. Ask a developer for help if you’re unsure.\n\nHow to Submit Your XML Sitemap to Google\n\nIt’s best practice to submit your sitemap to Google. (Rather than waiting for Google’s website crawlers to discover the file on their own.)\n\nBut first, make sure there are no issues with your XML sitemap.\n\nWith Semrush’s Site Audit tool, you can check whether your sitemap.xml file:\n\nCan’t be found\nHas formatting errors\nContains non-canonical or non-200 URLs\nIsn’t specified in robots.txt\nIs too large\nContains HTTP rather than HTTPS URLs\n\nThe tool also checks whether your SEO sitemap contains orphaned pages—URLs that aren’t linked to from anywhere on your site. (It’s best practice to add internal links to pages that should be indexed.)\n\nSimply go to the “Issues” report after setting up your audit. And enter “sitemap” into the search bar.\n\nIf the tool flags an error, warning, or notice, you can read “Why and how to fix it.”\n\nRerun the audit after implementing any fixes. So you can check they’re working correctly.\n\nWhen you’re happy with your sitemap audit, sign into Google Search Console. \n\nAnd go to “Indexing” > “Sitemaps.”\n\nTip\n\nIf you haven’t signed up and verified you own your site yet, check out our Google Search Console guide for instructions.\n\nEnter your sitemap’s URL into the “Add a new sitemap” section.\n\nAnd click “Submit” when you’re done.\n\nYou should then see your file in the “Submitted sitemaps” section.\n\nWhen Google has crawled your sitemap, you’ll see a “Success” notice in the “Status” column.\n\nGoogle will periodically re-crawl your SEO sitemap to check for any changes.\n\nBut if you make major changes that you want to be discovered quickly, you can re-submit your sitemap with a new request.\n\nFind and Fix Sitemap Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nXML Sitemap Best Practices\n\nIf you’re using a sitemap.xml file generated by your website platform or a specialized tool, it’ll probably meet XML sitemap best practices.\n\nBut if you want to make sure, read and understand these guidelines.\n\nFirst, your sitemap should only reference URLs that:\n\nYou want to be indexed. For example, you shouldn’t include pages from your staging environment. Or the URL for an order confirmation page.\nReturn a 200 status code. You shouldn’t attempt to index pages that return other http status codes. Such as 301 redirects (which indicate permanent redirects) or 404 errors (which indicate a page can’t be found).\nAre fully qualified and absolute. In other words, make sure to specify the entire URL with the scheme, authority, and path (e.g., “https://www.semrush.com/blog/”).\nAre canonicals. Canonical URLs represent the sole version of a page or the primary version of a duplicated page. \n\nAnd your sitemap file should:\n\nBe UTF-8 encoded. This is a system that ensures search engines can understand all the characters you’re using. For example, you’ll need to use & amp; (without the space) in place of a \"&\" symbol.\nBe less than 50MB or 50,000 URLs. If necessary, you can create multiple sitemaps and a sitemap index file.\nSpecify the correct namespace. A namespace is like a label that tells the search engine what kinds of rules the sitemap follows. Most sitemaps use the “http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9” namespace to show that the file conforms to standards set by sitemaps.org.\nInclude language and region variants for each URL (where applicable). You can learn more in this resource from Google.\n\nLastly, make sure to link to your sitemap from your robots.txt file. This is a website file that tells search engines which pages they should and shouldn’t crawl.\n\nEnsure Your SEO Sitemap Is Up to Code\n\nWith Semrush’s Site Audit, you can easily check for issues related to your XML sitemap.\n\nThe tool also checks for dozens of other issues that can harm your SEO results.\n\nCreate your free Semrush account and see what needs fixing on your site.\n\nFind and Fix Sitemap Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →",
