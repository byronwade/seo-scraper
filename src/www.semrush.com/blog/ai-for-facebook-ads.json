Harnessing AI could be what you need to overhaul your ad strategy.\n\nAI has the potential to speed up your creative process and boost your ROI. Let’s explore the best ways to use it for your Facebook ads.\n\nWhy Use AI for Facebook Ads?\n\nAccording to a survey of advertisers, using AI technology could save you at least five hours a week.\n\nAI can help by cutting out some tasks and refining others. You can leverage the technology to perform tasks like setting budgets, conducting research, and generating content.\n\nOn Facebook, you’re competing for attention with over three million advertisers, many chasing the same audience. While your toughest competitors are working on their campaigns, you need an edge to catch up or overtake them.\n\nAI tools can help you produce high-quality and engaging content that stands out on the feed.\n\nBut you’re not just up against competitors. You need a continuous supply of content given how quickly Facebook algorithms and trends change. How else can you stay relevant?\n\nTry AdCreative.ai\n\nGenerate high-converting Facebook ads with AI\n\nTry it Free →\nHow Facebook Already Uses AI\n\nAt this point, Facebook advertising has already integrated AI into its infrastructure. Understanding how this works can give you vital context for your advertising strategy.\n\nThe goal of Facebook’s AI algorithm is to match ads to users. Since both businesses and individuals are a significant portion of Meta’s audience, it wants to keep both happy.\n\nIt uses the algorithm to ensure it doesn’t bombard users with irrelevant ads or blow your marketing budget on disinterested parties.\n\nHere’s a quick look at the process:\n\nFacebook asks you to pick your desired audience, business objectives, and bid amount\nYou provide any existing market and customer data\nYou create the ad you want to appear on Facebook’s feed and upload it\nAI checks your content complies with Meta’s policies and assesses its quality\nFacebook filters out users that aren’t in your desired audience\nAI calculates the total value of your ad and compares it against others\nThe ads with the highest value appear on specific users’ feeds\n\nFacebook’s AI determines the value of ads based on three factors:\n\nAdvertiser bid: The amount you’re willing to pay for Facebook to show your ad to users\nEstimated action rate: The likelihood that users will interact with your ad by clicking, liking, or making a purchase\nAd quality: How relevant and engaging Facebook AI finds your ads based on factors like user feedback and content originality\nSource\n\nAs Facebook uses machine learning, it continuously refines this process. It can identify trends and patterns in the data which it uses to inform decisions about ad quality and estimated action rate. \n\nAll of this means that Facebook’s AI is automatically helping your ad campaigns launch faster and get the best results. \n\nHow to Make Facebook AI Work For You\n\nFacebook publishes best practices to ensure the AI algorithm rates you highly. Here’s what the AI is looking for:\n\nEasy readability\nA positive user experience on the landing page\nOriginal and substantive content\nTruthful representations of the product or service\nBalanced volume of ads to page content\nNo pop-ups or full-screen ads\n\nNotice how these rules create a Catch-22? Advertisers must rely on AI tools to effectively manage their Facebook ad campaigns and achieve ROI. \n\nBut AI-generated content draws from existing sources and can be generic and unoriginal.\n\nFor example, here's a sample output from ChatGPT:\n\nSearch for ‘haiku about a butterfly’ on Google and the top results are a little too close for comfort…\n\nSo, surely Facebook will penalize you if you rely on AI tools for generating ads?\n\nThe trick to escaping the Catch-22 is in how you use AI ads for Facebook. Let’s explore the best use cases and tools in detail below.\n\nKnowing Your Audience\n\nCombining human insight with AI capabilities can give you the most comprehensive analysis of your target market. The technology can process vast amounts of data to look for trends and patterns. You can use these insights to inform your marketing strategies.\n\nSay you run an online store selling kitchenware. Facebook’s AI analysis of your posts might reveal higher levels of engagement with content about reusable coffee filters among students. \n\nYou realize from the news that there’s recently been a lot of environmental action at local universities and colleges so now you know to focus on this angle in future ads.\n\nThe free Facebook Insights tool compiles data from its users and your customers to give you insights like these. It segments your audience based on factors like age, location, and interests to tell you more about them. Once you’ve defined your target market, you can advertise directly to them from the platform.\n\nCreating and Managing Ads\n\nAI content generators can write ad copy, design creatives, and suggest the ideal formatting. All you have to do is input key information like:\n\nTarget audience\nCampaign objectives\nAd format (e.g. image, carousel…)\nProduct or service details\nVisual assets\n\nAs AI can instantly produce content, you can request multiple variants of the same design. Then you can test each variant and choose the one that performs the best.\n\nFacebook doesn’t include tools to generate content. It only allows you to decide whether to automatically or manually place the ads. You must rely on third-party tools to create the media before uploading it to the platform.\n\nBasic prompt tools are good for quick inspiration. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to suggest ad copy based on the context you give.\n\nHowever, specialized marketing tools like Adcreative.ai and AI Social Content Generator guarantee more quality. They’re designed to optimize content for marketing purposes and create high-converting ads. You’re more likely to get things right on the first try rather than ending up in an argument with a bot.\n\nThese tools also offer more functionality than a basic AI chatbot. You can generate different types of media, access advanced editing features, and integrate with leading marketing platforms. AI Social Content Generator, for example, gives you fine control by letting you generate content layer by layer.\n\nPersonalizing Content\n\nNow that AI has become the norm, the majority of consumers expect a personalized experience. They’re also more likely to get frustrated by generic and irrelevant experiences with brands.\n\nFacebook Dynamic Ads lets you cater more easily to individuals by targeting specific groups. You decide who sees what by categorizing users based on their behavior, interests, and past interactions. A basic example is how you might only display a first-time offer to people who’ve never bought from your business before.\n\nTip\n\nWhen using this feature, Facebook says it’s best not to apply unnecessary filters. You may limit your reach and find your ads underperform. \n\nEnsuring Quality and Relevance\n\nAI can go beyond just creating content to making sure that your ads will resonate with your target audience.\n\nTo show your audience the most relevant ads, Facebook’s Ad Manager lets you upload multiple versions of an ad and test them on different users. The AI then measures their performance over time and you can choose the best one for your final campaign. \n\nThat means you can still find the most effective strategy even when the data is pushing you in a different direction.\n\nThere are a few variations on this strategy but a popular one is A/B testing. That’s when you only change subtle details like the header font or background color. \n\nTip\n\nAdCreative.ai makes A/B testing easy by allowing you to quickly create several iterations of a design. You can ensure they’re all of a professional quality — no matter how many you need to create. \n\nOptimizing Ad Budgets\n\nIt’s possible to create an amazing campaign but still lose money due to financial mismanagement. Businesses might set bids too high or spend too much on low-performing sets.\n\nAI ensures you allocate your budget where it’s likely to drive results. Facebook’s Meta Advantage tool analyzes historical data and predicts future performance to decide where the money should go.\n\nYou just set a single budget for your campaign. If you want more control, you can choose to set a daily limit rather than one for the entire lifetime. Facebook then automatically manages the budget for you, saving you time and lowering your costs.\n\nTracking and Forecasting Performance\n\nAI can help you measure the effectiveness of an ad campaign once it’s underway. It continuously analyzes data and provides real-time insights so you can make timely decisions. Depending on your performance, you can either quickly course correct or double down on a successful strategy.\n\nMeta Pixel is the main AI and analytics tool on Facebook. It’s code you can add to your website that tracks visitor activity like product views and purchases. You get an insight into what’s popular and who’s most likely to convert.\n\nTip\n\nIf you want to compare your advertising strategy against similar brands, AdClarity can analyze your competitor's ads. You can track their ad spending, see their top social ads, and benchmark yourself against them.\n\nHow to Use AdCreative.ai to Generate Quick Facebook Ads\n\nAdCreative.ai bases its output on data from billions of top-performing brands. With this app, you can instantly generate text and creatives that are aligned with current best practices.\n\nHere’s the process for creating a Facebook ad:\n\nStep 1. Set Up Your Account\n\nSelect AdCreative.ai in the Semrush App Center and sign up for a free 3-day trial. \n\nOnce inside the main dashboard, type your website address into the top field and click ‘Import Brand’. AdCreative.ai will sync and collect data from the URL.\n\nStep 2. Add Your Brand Details\n\nAdd your brand name, logo, and color scheme using the boxes below.

In a recent release, Meta said one of their key focuses in 2024 was extending the platform’s AI capabilities.\n\nMeta’s main goal is to develop the world’s best recommendation technology by 2026. They’re currently working on a new model that draws from larger data sets than we’ve seen before. This advanced version of recommendations will also encompass more areas of the platform including the feed and videos.\n\nIf you’ve got an ad account on Facebook, that means your reach could extend further than ever before.\n\nOutside of Facebook, you can find an ever-increasing number of AI marketing apps to help you manage ad campaigns.",
