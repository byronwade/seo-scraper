  "content": "What Is Search Intent?\n\nSearch intent (also known as user intent) is the reason why a user types a particular query into a search engine. It represents what the user is trying to achieve with their search, whether that's finding an answer to a question, looking for a specific website, purchasing a product, or exploring a topic.\n\nLet's say someone searches for “best dog food” on Google.\n\nThey're not trying to navigate to a specific page. And they don't want to buy a specific product either. (At least not yet.) \n\nThey want to do their research before making a purchase.\n\nThat means the keyword has commercial intent. And we can use this knowledge to adjust our content to target this keyword better.\n\nWhy Is Search Intent Important in SEO?\n\nThe top goal of search engines (like Google) is to provide relevant results for users. So understanding search intent can impact your ability to rank in search results.\n\nGoogle has put a lot of effort into interpreting the intent behind search queries used in search. \n\n(Just take a look at Google's Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines—there's a whole section on user intent and how to identify different intent types.)\n\nSo if you want to rank in Google, you must make sure your pages satisfy the search intent behind the keywords they’re targeting.\n\nA thorough understanding of search intent can help you: \n\nHave a more effective content strategy: by targeting keywords that align with the needs of your target audience\nCreate relevant content: by understanding your users' needs and creating content that fulfills them\nRank higher in search results: by showing search engines that your content is valuable and relevant to their users\n\nTo illustrate this, let's get back to our example from the beginning. The keyword “best dog food” has 74,000 searches per month.\n\nLet's say you have an ecommerce website selling pet food. \n\nWouldn't it be great to rank for this keyword with the product page of your best-selling dog food brand?\n\nAbsolutely. But you won't. \n\nIf you look at the Google results, you'll see that Google does not consider “best dog food” to be a transactional keyword.\n\nThe search results are full of review articles listing the top dog food brands. It does not rank any ecommerce websites.\n\nTherefore, you wouldn't be able to rank with a product page here, even if it seems relevant at first glance.\n\nGet a team account\n\nTo save on Semrush subscription\n\nLearn more →\nThe Four Types of Search Intent\n\nWe usually distinguish between four types of search intent:\n\nNavigational intent: Users want to find a specific page (e.g., “reddit login”)\nInformational intent: Users want to learn more about something (e.g., “what is seo”)\nCommercial intent: Users want to do research before making a purchase decision (e.g., “best coffee maker”)\nTransactional intent: Users want to complete a specific action, usually a purchase (e.g., “buy subaru forester”)\n\nLet's take a closer look at each of them.\n\n1. Navigational Search Intent\n\nNavigational intent means that the user wants to find a specific page. Unlike with other intent types, searchers already know what they’re trying to find.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with navigational intent: \n\nstarbucks\ngmail login\nsemrush keyword magic tool\nikea refund policy\n\nAs you can see, navigational keywords are often branded. They're all about ensuring that your target audience can find your pages easily when they need to find them.\n\n2. Informational Search Intent\n\nInformational search intent means that the user wants to learn something. These searches are often phrased as questions and use words like who, what, where, why, and how.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with informational intent: \n\nbruce willis movies\nwhat is seo\ncalifornia time now\nhow to clean a dishwasher\n\nGoogle will often answer the more specific questions directly in the SERP:\n\nBut for most informational queries, the No. 1 content type is still a blog post. That's why blogging likely needs to be part of your SEO strategy. \n\nHere are the top benefits of targeting informational keywords:\n\nVisibility: Informational queries make up a significant number of searches in Google. If you want visibility, you can’t ignore them. \nBuilding trust: Providing useful information andeducating your audience is a great way to build trust in your expertise\nTargeting new leads: Content that targets informational keywords can bring in new leads you can convert later\n\nAlthough ranking for informational queries probably won't bring you tons of direct conversions, it can still be a valuable opportunity to grow your business.\n\n3. Commercial Search Intent\n\nCommercial search intent includes keywords your audience uses when they’re doing their research before a purchase.\n\nThe commercial intent lies somewhere between informational and transactional intent. The user is looking for information, but the information is closely connected to the action.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with commercial intent: \n\nbest indoor plants for low light\napple watch ultra review\nmailchimp alternatives\nhbo max vs netflix\n\nThe search results for commercial queries often include third-party pages with independent reviews of the products. That's why it can be very hard (even impossible) to rank for some commercial keywords relevant to your brand. \n\nLuckily, there are marketing strategies (as well as tools, like Semrush’s Surround Sound) that can help you stay visible in the decision-making process of your potential customers. \n\n4. Transactional Search Intent\n\nTransactional search intent means users want to do something specific, often an action you might want them to do as a business owner.\n\nDespite what the name implies, this isn’t restricted just to purchases. For example, a user doing a transactional search might want to complete a newsletter signup or download software.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with transactional intent: \n\niphone 13 pro max price\npersonality test online\nsemrush trial\nwatch friends\n\nTransactional keywords are your money-makers. These are the keywords your future customers use when they’re ready to convert. \n\nHow to Determine Search Intent\n\nSearch intent often aligns with where users are in the marketing funnel. \n\nIn general, it works like this: \n\nAwareness: User searches for informational keywords like “how to do keyword research”\nConsideration: User searches for commercial keywords like “best keyword research tools”\nConversion: User searches for transactional or navigational keywords like “Semrush plans”\n\nThat's why determining search intent is a crucial step in any content strategy.\n\nIn many cases, you can determine a keyword’s intent based on the keyword itself (e.g., question words like what, why, or how usually signify informational intent).\n\nBut sometimes, the intent is not that obvious at first sight. \n\nThe thing is, you don’t have to figure it out yourself—several tools in Semrush calculate search intent automatically for every keyword. \n\nHere's where you find the “Intent” metric in Keyword Overview:\n\nThe calculation is based on the words contained within the keyword phrase and the SERP features that are present in the search results of the analyzed keyword. \n\nIn the Keyword Magic Tool, there's a dedicated data column that shows the intent type of the keyword. That means you can work with search intent during your keyword research without leaving the tool or having to guess the intent.\n\nYou can also use a filter to only show keywords with a certain intent type.\n\nLet's say you're doing keyword research for a company blog. Since a blog usually targets an audience in the “Awareness” stage of the marketing funnel, you probably want to focus on keywords with informational intent.\n\nJust click the “Intent” filter and select the intent type you want. \n\nTip: To learn more about how to integrate search intent into your content strategy, read our keyword research guide.\n\nAlways check the actual SERP results to see what pages rank for the keyword.\n\nIn Keyword Overview, you can do that by scrolling down to the “SERP Analysis” section.\n\nBy clicking the search icon, you can also see the snapshot of the actual search results to get a better overview of what the SERP for your keyword looks like.\n\nProper analysis of the SERP ensures that you'll learn about the intent behind a query and allows you to get inspiration from the top results.\n\nIt is important to realize that to nail search intent in Google’s eyes, you need to do much more than just create the right type of page.\n\nStudy the SERP and find out:\n\nWhat makes the top results best\nHow deeply the top results cover the topic\nWhat angle they use\nHow can you create even better content (by providing better information, data, examples, media, or user experience)\n\nLet’s say a user wants to buy a new air purifier. They search for “best air purifier.”\n\nThe intent is clearly commercial.\n\nBut you need more than just a standard top 10 review to rank for the keyword. \n\nOne of the top results—the 10 Best Air Purifiers review by Modern Castle—is a great example of commercial content that puts their readers' needs first.\n\nIt opens with a photo of Derek, the author of the post, with all the models he has tested for the purpose of the review. \n\nRight below, you can find a video summarizing the post for those who prefer watching reviews rather than reading.\n\nThe article categorizes products by coverage area—which is probably the most important aspect you consider when choosing an air purifier. \n\nThen, the article continues by covering each of the products, providing technical specs and other details. As well as the actual performance data derived from the author’s tests.\n\nThe post concludes with a table comparing all the products and their rating. And links to a detailed review for each of them. \n\nThe information is easy to digest, well-structured, and highly organized.\n\nFollow this approach when adding content to your website. \n\nAsk yourself: \n\nWhat is my audience trying to find on this page?\n\nThen build a well-structured page with that need in mind. \n\nFAQs\nHow Important Is Search Intent?\n\nUnderstanding search intent is an essential part of keyword research for SEO.\n\nBetter intent optimization means Google is more likely to show your page for the query. Which, in turn, means more relevant and qualified traffic to your website.\n\nWhat Is Keyword Intent?\n\nKeyword intent or keyword search intent is the same thing as search intent. It basically means the search intent behind a specific keyword. Some keywords may have a clear intent, while some intent may not be obvious from the keyword. We call this a “mixed intent.” \n\nA common example of a mixed intent is a search term that is the name of a specific product—like “iphone 13 pro max.” \n\nSince it’s unclear whether a user’s intent is transactional, commercial, or informational, the Google search results will include various types of results and SERP features to make sure they meet different search needs.\n\nHow Many Types of Search Intent Are There?\n\nThe most common intent categorization includes four types of search intent: navigational, informational, commercial, and transactional.\n\nGoogle uses a slightly different categorization. In their Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines, they distinguish between:\n\n“Know” queries: Users want to get information about something (corresponds to the informational intent)\n“Do” queries: Users want to do something (corresponds to the transactional intent)\n“Website” queries: Users want to visit a specific website (corresponds to the navigational intent)\n“Visit-in-person” queries: Users want to visit a specific physical place\nHow Do I Find the Search Intent Behind a Keyword?\n\nTo find the search intent of a keyword, you can simply use Semrush. All of our keyword-related tools detect search intent automatically. Create a free account and try it now!\n\nIt’s also a good idea to look at the search results for a keyword to see the actual results and SERP features Google identified as the most relevant.\n\nGet a team account\n\nTo save on Semrush subscription\n\nLearn more →",
