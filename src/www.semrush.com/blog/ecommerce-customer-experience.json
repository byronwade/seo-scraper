  "content": "What Is the Ecommerce Customer Experience?\n\nThe ecommerce customer experience (CX) encompasses every interaction a customer has with your business or brand. \n\nIt begins the moment they come into contact with your brand. And continues even after they buy something from you. \n\nIt can start with a Facebook post, progress to your website, and continue with a post-purchase email marketing campaign. This entire process is referred to as the buyer journey. \n\nAnd every touchpoint within that journey is part of the customer experience.\n\nRegardless of the type of ecommerce business you have, three distinct parts of the customer journey influence customer experience.\n\nPre-Purchase Experience\n\nThe pre-purchase experience begins before a consumer makes a purchase. It can start as early as a social media post or a Google search result. \n\nEvery interaction with your brand from that moment on is part of the pre-purchase experience. \n\nThis is why it’s imperative to know your audience well. Whether they accidentally stumble upon your content or specifically seek you out, your branding needs to speak to them. If your content piques someone’s interest, your website design and messaging need to keep it. \n\nSpecific tactics can help move leads through the funnel. \n\nLike these: \n\nEngaging storytelling: Use your website, blog, and social channels to share stories about how your products are made, the people behind them, and positive customer experiences\nA compelling value proposition: A clear statement that explains how your product or service solves a customer’s problems or improves their situation\nPersonalized content marketing: This could involve recommending products based on past browsing or purchase history, customizing email marketing campaigns, or adjusting website content to match a visitor's profile\nUser-generated content (UGC): Content created by actual customers is authentic and compelling \n\nZappos is an excellent example of a brand that uses storytelling and UGC well. On Instagram, Zappos posts relatable running videos. \n\nPurchasing Experience\n\nThe purchasing experience is the time between when a new prospect lands on your website and completes a purchase. \n\nYour goal is to make it easy for them to find what they want. And check out with zero hassles. \n\nThe following elements can help improve the purchase experience:\n\nEffortless navigation on your website\nClear product categorization\nIntuitive search functions\nA healthy cross-section of product reviews\nWell-organized product pages\nInformative product descriptions\nEasy-to-find transactional information\n\nAmazon is a good example of a seamless purchasing experience. There’s a reason they have an 89% customer loyalty rate. \n\nVisitors can easily find what they’re looking for. And Amazon creates a personalized experience with product recommendations, upsells, and cross-sells. \n\nWhen you log in, Amazon creates curated shopping suggestions based on your purchase history. So, if you often buy pet supplies, you may see suggested items for your furry friend. \n\nAmazon will also suggest purchases based on items saved to your wish lists.\n\nThis flawless experience needs to extend to the actual transaction—a common sticking point for many ecommerce brands. \n\nA clunky checkout flow can negatively impact conversion rates when customers don’t get the expected experience. \n\nFor example, customers may be deterred from purchasing if they’re met with a multi-page checkout or mandatory account creation.\n\nPost-Purchase Experience\n\nThe post-purchase experience is a chance to exceed expectations. And turn a one-time shopper into a loyal customer. \n\nKeeping customers informed can contribute to a positive post-purchase experience. \n\nThis includes: \n\nPrompt order confirmations\nTransparent shipping information\nHassle-free returns process\n\nFor example, consider Zappos’ shipping and return policies. Their customer support team has single-handedly built a cult-like customer base. \n\nTheir free shipping and 365-day return policy have set a benchmark for post-purchase excellence.\n\nThe post-purchase experience should also include marketing communications. Give customers a reason to buy again by sending a mix of informative and promotional content via email. And using social media to keep your brand top of mind. \n\nFurther reading: Ecommerce SEO: A Simple Guide for Beginners\n\nHow the Ecommerce Customer Experience Impacts Your Business\n\nFinding ways to make your ecommerce site stand out is crucial. One of the best ways to accomplish this is a stellar customer experience. \n\nThe ecommerce customer experience can directly influence many parts of your business. \n\nThis includes: \n\nCustomer retention: A positive experience will leave your customers satisfied, more likely to buy again, and less sensitive to price changes or minor mistakes\nBrand loyalty: Exceptional CX fosters a strong emotional connection to your brand. And can lead to increased customer loyalty.\nConversion rates: If customers find it easy to navigate your site and make purchases, they're more likely to complete a transaction\nCompetitive advantage: Offering a superior customer experience can help you stand out from competitors. And attract more customers.\nReduced costs: Efficient customer service and a well-designed user interface can reduce the need for extensive customer support\nOverall revenue: Happy customers are more likely to make repeat purchases. And recommend you to their friends, directly impacting your bottom line.\nMarket growth: Exceptional customer experience leads to a strong ecommerce platform that can open up more opportunities to expand your product offering and enter new markets\nBrand reputation: In the age of social media and customer reviews, too many bad experiences can significantly damage your brand's reputation\n\nStarbucks’ loyalty program is a great example of excellent customer experience. Although they are a brick-and-mortar, their mobile app accounts for about 50% of all sales. \n\nThrough the app, Starbucks customers can order their favorite beverage, receive personalized recommendations, and skip the line at the store. \n\nImage Source: Starbucks\n\nHow Is the Ecommerce Customer Experience Measured?\n\nMeasuring the ecommerce customer experience requires understanding various metrics. And key performance indicators (KPIs). \n\nFocusing solely on conversion rates as a measure of success might be tempting, but there’s more to it. \n\nThe following three KPIs can show you what you’re doing well. And point out opportunities for improvement. \n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nNPS measures the likelihood that customers will recommend your brand to their friends and family. It's simple to use. And helps quantify how online shoppers feel about your brand. \n\nAn example of how you might use NPS is a post-purchase survey asking shoppers how likely they are to recommend your brand. \n\nYou can use these metrics to find happy customers more likely to leave positive reviews, join a loyalty program, or promote your brand on social media. \n\nCustomer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)\n\nCSAT measures customer satisfaction. It provides real-time feedback on interactions like customer support, checkout, or product delivery. \n\nFor example, after a customer chat support session, you could send a quick survey asking customers to rate their satisfaction. \n\nIf you see low scores, you know there's a problem to fix right away. Staying on top of issues like this will help to keep customers happy. \n\nCustomer Effort Score (CES)\n\nThe Customer Effort Score (CES) measures how easy it is for customers to complete an action. Like returning a product or finding information on your website. \n\nLet’s say you ask customers to rate how easy it was to return a product. A low score means it's easy. A high score means it's hard. And the return process needs simplifying. \n\nPro tip\n\nKnowing your Core Web Vitals score can help you measure the ecommerce customer experience. It alerts you to slow-loading pages and more. Learn more about these metrics in our Core Web Vitals guide. \n\nStrategies for Improving the Customer Experience\n\nA better customer experience can help attract more customers. And increase customer lifetime value. \n\nHere’s how to improve ecommerce customer experience: \n\n1. Design a User-Friendly Ecommerce Platform\n\nA user-friendly ecommerce platform is critical for customer engagement. \n\nSixty percent of customers are more likely to click away from a poorly designed website. Regardless of what grabbed their attention in the first place. \n\nA consistent experience is essential to keep customers engaged. This requires designing your website with user experience (UX) in mind.\n\nThe following can contribute to a better UX:\n\nClutter-free layout\nClear navigation\nMobile responsive design\nHomepage customization \n\nNike’s homepage is a good example of a clear and clutter-free layout. They offer several options to find what you’re looking for. You can shop by sport, style, gender, and more. \n\nAside from the obvious, like happy customers, a user-friendly website may also positively impact search engine results. \n\nWhen shoppers stay on your page, return to it frequently, and make purchases, it signals to Google that your website is useful. And since Google wants its users to have a positive experience, this can help influence your rankings. \n\n2. Use Data to Create Targeted Content\n\nAccording to McKinsey & Company, 71% of online customers expect a personalized shopping experience. And 76% are easily turned off if they don’t get it. \n\nUsing artificial intelligence (AI) to collect customer data can help you deliver a better online experience. And meet or exceed customer expectations. \n\nThese tools can help you analyze things like purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographic information. To offer targeted product recommendations and customized content.\n\nLet’s say you sell outdoor clothing. A research tool like One2Target can help you get to know your audience better. And the better you know your audience, the more personalized and targeted content you can create. \n\nTo use this tool, head over to Semrush and log into your dashboard. \n\nClick on the “.Trends” drop-downon the left menu under “Projects.” Then click “One2Target” to begin your research. \n\nFrom here, create a list of up to 100 competitors to gather research data. \n\nNote\n\nYou can only compare five competitor domains at a time.\n\nClick the “Create List” tab and type in a competitor name. Choose from a list of similar competitors, or enter your own. \n\nOnce you’ve selected the ecommerce businesses that are similar to yours, click “Create and Analyze.” \n\nThis will provide you with information you can use for a complete ecommerce customer experience analysis. \n\nNote\n\nGive your list a name if you plan to create multiple competitor lists for different marketing campaigns.\n\nOne2Target breaks down audience information into the following categories:\n\nDemographics: Site visitors by age, sex, and location\nSocioeconomics: Relevant information about household income, education level, and more\nBehavior: Other sites your audience visits and their preferred online shopping device\nAudience Overlap: Where you have the best chance of engaging your audience\n\nUse this data to create targeted content.\n\nInformative content could be what separates you from the competition. And helps boost your rankings. \n\nThis includes: \n\nHow-to guides\nProduct demonstrations\nExpert reviews\nComparison guides \nEmail marketing based on browsing and purchase history\n\nOutdoor retailer Zorali makes it easy for customers to make informed purchases. \n\nTheir online content includes outdoor guides, user-generated content, product reviews, and instructional videos. To create an excellent customer experience at every stage of the funnel. \n\nThis product page for their best-selling backpack features multiple clear images and a product review video. \n\nAnd answers all the questions a potential customer might ask when shopping for a backpack.\n\nStreamline Ecommerce Audience Research\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\n3. Improve Ecommerce Customer Support\n\nLeaving customers wondering how to contact you or find important information sends a negative message. \n\nYour customers may interpret your lack of transparency as a lack of concern for their shopping experience. \n\nHere’s how you can provide better support: \n\nPost privacy policies and preferences: Include a link to your privacy policies in your footer\nCreate a clear return policy: Make it accessible in several places on your website. Like the footer, product page, and shopping cart.\nBe upfront about shipping rates and delivery times: Offer this information early in the checkout process. So there are no surprises in the last step of checkout.\nProvide live package tracking: Take advantage of third-party apps if necessary to keep consumers informed\nHighlight business values: Share your company ethos throughout your website for values-based consumers\nOffer store locators: If you have physical locations, include a live map locator for easy searching\nProvide a product locator: If you sell your products in physical stores, give consumers the opportunity to shop local\nImplement a chatbot: A chatbot provides instant assistance. And can often resolve issues without escalating them to a live support person.\n4. Simplify the Buying Process\n\nStreamlining the buying process with a single-page checkout can reduce friction. Forcing shoppers to make too many decisions—like clicking three pages deep to enter a credit card—can increase the chances of cart abandonment. \n\nA concise and straightforward checkout experience may contribute to higher conversion rates.\n\nUnique Vintage, a vintage-inspired fashion brand in California, uses a simple, one-page checkout. And doesn’t require account creation. \n\nGive your shoppers the gift of a swift and hassle-free buying process.\n\n5. Create an Inventory Management System\n\nManaging inventory levels is critical in ecommerce. If customers repeatedly find their favorite products out of stock, they may get frustrated. And move on to a different brand. \n\nHow can you ensure this doesn’t happen on your website? \n\nInventory management software can track the flow of products. So you’re always stocked up on customer favorites. \n\nUsing “In Stock,” “Low Stock,” and “Out of Stock” flags to communicate inventory levels to your customers can also help manage expectations. \n\nFor example, if someone is looking for a dog bed and your inventory is running low, let them know. \n\nThe “Low Stock” warning will clearly communicate that if they want the bed, they should purchase it soon. \n\nChewy organizes these views for their customers in two ways: \n\nAdding an “Out of Stock” banner to items that are currently unavailable\nPlacing all “Out of Stock” items at the very end of their inventory showings \n\nTransparency prevents disappointment and helps manage customer expectations. \n\n6. Improve Return Policies\n\nA customer-friendly return policy helps build trust and confidence. Although many ecommerce companies no longer offer free returns, an upfront return policy with clear instructions can contribute to a positive purchase experience.\n\nBut don’t stop there. \n\nAnything you can offer for a hassle-free return process may be remembered. And appreciated. \n\nAdditional perks can contribute to a better experience. Like prepaid return labels for orders over a certain dollar amount. Or extending the return window during the holiday season. \n\n7. Create an Omnichannel Presence\n\nAn omnichannel approach to customer experience can create a cohesive customer experience. \n\nOmnichannel is when you create content for a variety of sales channels like:\n\nYour website\nSocial media\nGoogle or Bing ads\nEmail marketing\nMobile app\n\nMost importantly, your brand should have a consistent look and feel across all channels. \n\nFor example, shoe brand Vessi has a recognizable brand, no matter where customers shop or interact with the company. \n\nThey often use real customers in their marketing, feature outdoor landscape imagery, and use a consistent filter on all images. \n\nHere’s a post from their Facebook page. \n\nAnd a screenshot of their Instagram feed.\n\nAnd a screenshot from their welcome email.\n\nEach platform Vessi uses has a consistent look and feel. Helping ensure customers also have a consistent experience across channels. \n\nAnother advantage of omnichannel marketing is the opportunity to reinforce brand identity. \n\nCustomers expect the same level of service, pricing, and product availability. Whether shopping on a desktop computer, mobile device, or physical store. \n\n8. Improve Delivery Time\n\nNot every ecommerce retailer can offer fast and free shipping. However, expedited shipping options can keep customers happy. \n\nReducing delivery times can also increase customer satisfaction. \n\nEven if you can’t offer two-day shipping like Amazon, aim to make it as fast as possible. And clearly state expected delivery dates and windows. To ensure customers know what to expect. \n\n9. Provide Easy Search and Navigation\n\nProviding the best ecommerce customer experience starts with allowing customers to transition from platform to platform seamlessly. \n\nMany consumers switch devices when shopping. Sixty-five percent start out on their mobile phone. And 61% continue shopping on their laptop. \n\nCustomers need to find products quickly. And pick up their search where they left off, regardless of the device they started on. \n\nFor example, on the Nike mobile app, customers can add products to their favorites or cart. And if they switch to their laptop, their cart will still be there. \n\nThe user experience on the Nike app and website is consistent. So customers know what to expect. Regardless of how or where they access the content or products. \n\nImplementing advanced search algorithms and filters can enhance the accuracy and relevance of search results. Well-organized categories and subcategories contribute to a seamless user journey.\n\nFor example, if you're using the Nike app to search for running shoes, an advanced search algorithm will be able to show you the appropriate products. \n\nFilters let you narrow search results even more. Like choosing your shoe size, color, or how much you want to spend.\n\nFurther reading: Ecommerce Website Optimization: 12 Strategies to Increase Sales\n\nChallenges and Solutions in Ecommerce CX\n\nNavigating the complexities of the ecommerce customer experience presents various challenges. \n\nHere's a deeper look into common obstacles. And potential solutions.\n\nAdapting to Rapidly Changing Consumer Expectations\n\nConsumer expectations evolve quickly. \n\nHere’s how you can stay current with consumer expectations: \n\nImplement regular surveys: This could include post-purchase feedback, customer support surveys, and product reviews\nCreate feedback loops: This involves looking for patterns in customer feedback, implementing changes, and analyzing feedback. So you constantly improve and evolve.\nConduct market research: Use technology to predict what customers will want next. So you can be ready to meet their needs before they ask.\nMonitoring Site Health\n\nCustomers want a unified experience across all channels. Whether shopping from a mobile app, website, or physical store. \n\nHowever, manually monitoring your site’s health can be a challenging and time-consuming task. \n\nUse the Site Audit tool to run regular audits. To help ensure your website is efficient, error-free, and properly optimized for SEO.\n\nSite Audit can help you detect:\n\nDuplicate content\nBroken links\nSEO issues like missing H1 title tags and meta descriptions\nPage load speed\n\nTo use this tool, log into your Semrush dashboard. Click the drop-down “SEO” under “Projects” on the left-hand navigation. Scroll down until you see “Site Audit.”\n\nAfter clicking Site Audit, click “Create Project” in the upper right-hand corner.\n\nNote\n\nIf you don’t have existing projects, you’ll see a page with a text bar prompting you to “Enter Domain.” Do so and click “Start Audit.”\n\nEnter your URL and click “Create project.” \n\nOnce complete, return to your list of projects. Click “Set up” to run your first audit. \n\nYou’ll be asked to configure the number of pages you want checked. And the crawl source. This can be your website, sitemap, or URLs from a file. \n\nThe audit can take up to 24 hours, and you’ll get an email when the audit is complete. \n\nOnce complete, click on your URL in the list of projects and view your audit. \n\nClick through the tabs at the top, starting with “Overview.” To view issues with your site in more detail. \n\nHead to your website to fix any problems detected. This can help improve the ecommerce customer experience. \n\nImprove the Ecommerce Customer Experience\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nPersonalizing Customer Interactions at Scale\n\nMaking each customer feel special can get challenging as your ecommerce business grows.\n\nHowever, using smart tech like data analysis and AI can help predict customer needs. And allow you to connect with multiple customers in a personal way. \n\nAI chatbots can chat with customers like a friend. They can answer questions, recommend products, and help with orders. \n\nAs your store grows and you can no longer manage a live chat, a chatbot can still make each customer feel heard. And valued.\n\nMachine learning can help predict what your customers might like. It can make product recommendations based on previous visits, purchases, and search queries. \n\nImplementing Data Privacy and Security\n\nLetting customers know how you keep their data safe can make them feel more secure shopping with you.\n\nUse strong security measures. Like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to keep data secure and unreadable by hackers.\nHire a cybersecurity expert to check your website for vulnerabilities periodically. So you can find and fix any weak spots.\nStay updated on rules about keeping customer data safe. Like GDPR in Europe and privacy laws in California.\nPut your privacy policies where customers can easily find them on your website\n\nFurther reading: What Is a Data Strategy and How Do You Create One?\n\nCreate an Excellent Ecommerce Experience with Semrush \n\nProviding an exceptional ecommerce customer experience is just the start.
