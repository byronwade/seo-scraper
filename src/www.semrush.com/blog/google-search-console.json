  "content": "What Is Google Search Console?\n\nGoogle Search Console (GSC) is a free tool that helps you monitor your site’s search performance and technical SEO health.\n\nIt reports on a variety of metrics, from search appearance to user experience. Which can help you improve your site and get more traffic from Google.\n\nHere are just a few things you can do with GSC:\n\nReview how your site is performing on Google\nSee which pages Google can find and index on your site\nSubmit sitemaps and individual URLs for crawling\nIdentify technical SEO errors\nAnd much more\n\nIn this guide, we’ll teach you how to use Google Search Console to improve your SEO.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nHow to Set Up Google Search Console\n\nFirst, sign in to Search Console with your Google account.\n\nThe first time you log in, you’ll see a pop-up asking you to add a property (i.e., your website).\n\nYou have two options here: add a domain or a URL prefix.\n\nAdd a Domain Property\n\nAdding a domain property will provide the most comprehensive view of your website’s information.\n\nYou’ll get data from all URLs under the domain name, including all protocols, subdomains, and paths.\n\nIf you add a property this way, you need to verify it through your DNS (domain name system) provider.\n\nHere’s how the process works:\n\nFirst, add your domain in the “Domain” option (without HTTP/HTTPS and www).\n\nLet’s say your domain URL is “https://www.yoursite.com.” Enter “yoursite.com” in the blank space provided and click “CONTINUE.”\n\nThen, copy the TXT record from the instructions dialog box.\n\nIn a new tab, sign in to your account with your domain registrar. For this example, we'll use GoDaddy as our domain registrar.\n\nOnce you log in, access your DNS settings by clicking on the nine dots in the navigation bar, beside your business name. And hitting “Domains.”\n\nIn your Domain Portfolio dashboard, select the three dots beside your domain name and click on “Edit DNS.”\n\nYou should now be in the DNS Management window. Add a new TXT record by clicking “Add” in the DNS Records section.\n\nA form will pop up. Fill it out as follows:\n\nType: TXT\nName: @\nValue: [Paste the TXT record from Google Search Console]\nTTL: 1 hour\n\nWhen you’re done, click “Add record.”\n\nNow go back to Search Console and click “Verify.”\n\nYou may get a message that says “Ownership verification failed” at first. But don’t worry if the verification doesn’t work immediately.\n\nDNS record changes can take anywhere from a few hours to 48 hours to update. Wait at least an hour and try verifying again by choosing your website from the properties list.\n\nUpon successful verification, you’ll see a confirmation message like this:\n\nOr Add a URL Prefix Property\n\nAdding your site with the “URL prefix” option makes sense when you want to view data for only a specific section of your site. For example, your blog.\n\nStart by entering your URL under the “URL prefix” option. And then click “CONTINUE.” (In this case, let’s use “https://www.yoursite.com/blog/.”)\n\nGoogle allows multiple verification methods for a URL prefix:\n\nHTML file (recommended)\nHTML tag\nGoogle Analytics\nGoogle Tag Manager\nDomain name provider\n\nFor this example, we’ll use Google’s recommended “HTML file” upload method.\n\nClick on “HTML file” to expand the HTML file section, where you’ll find the file download button.\n\nDownload your HTML verification file and upload it to the root directory (or the top-most directory in your site hierarchy) of the website you want to verify.\n\nFor example, if you want to verify “www.yourwebsite.com,” then the root directory is your homepage.\n\nIf you want to verify “www.yourwebsite.com/blog/,” then the root directory is “/blog/.”\n\nIn this case, you’d upload the file to “/blog/.” And all the child directories under it would be verified.\n\nOnce you complete this step, click “VERIFY” in Search Console. \n\nSimilar to adding a domain property, you may need to wait for changes to take effect.\n\nIf you aren’t able to immediately verify your site, check back later and choose the unverified property. GSC will try to automatically verify you.\n\nTip: If you have any trouble adding or verifying a property, read Google’s guide to GSC verification.\n\nOwners, Users, and Permissions\n\nYou can have one of two roles in a Search Console account: owner or user. Your permissions, or what you can access, depend on your role.\n\nLet’s discuss the different types of owners and users, as well as their permissions:\n\n1. Owner: An owner has total control over the property in Search Console. A user with owner rights can add or remove other users, view all data, configure settings, and use all tools within Search Console. \n\nThere are two kinds of owners. And they both share the same permissions.\n\nVerified owner: Verified owners are people who have verified ownership of the property using a verification token (like an HTML file or tag) \nDelegated owner: Delegated owners get GSC access via verified owners\n\n2. User: Users still have access to GSC. But their permissions are more limited than owners.\n\nFull user: A full user has view rights to all data for a property and can take certain actions\nRestricted user: A restricted user has partial access and may not be able to view all the available data in an account \nAssociate: Associates are people who can’t open or view your Search Console account or data directly. But they can perform other tasks depending on the type of association.\n\nIf you’re the property owner, you have the ability to add new users and grant permissions.\n\nTo add a new user, navigate to “Settings” > “Users and permissions.”\n\nAnd click “ADD USER.”\n\nEnter the new user’s email address and select the access type. Then, click “ADD.”\n\nThe newly added user can now access your property in Search Console.\n\nHow to Add a Sitemap to Google Search Console\n\nA sitemap file includes all the website URLs you want Google to crawl and index. This is important because Google needs to crawl and index your pages in order to rank them.\n\nGoogle will crawl and index your site eventually. But submitting an XML sitemap directly via GSC can speed up the process.\n\nTo submit your sitemap, click “Sitemaps” on the navigation sidebar and enter the sitemap URL in the given field. Then click “Submit.”\n\nOnce Google is done processing your sitemap, you’ll see a message like this:\n\nPro tip: To ensure your sitemap is working properly, we recommended running a crawl-based audit of your website.\n\nLike Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nSet up a project in the tool and crawl your website.\n\nThen head to the “Issues” tab and search for “sitemap.”\n\nThe tool will show whether there are any issues detected and offer advice on how to fix each issue.\n\nGoogle Search Console Reports and Features\n\nNow that you’ve activated Search Console for your website, added users, and submitted a sitemap to Google, it’s time to look at the different Search Console reports and features you can use.\n\nPerformance Report\n\nThe “Performance” report provides data about how your website is performing on Google.\n\nIt shows four metrics:\n\nTotal clicks: The number of times people clicked on your site from the search results\nTotal impressions: The number of times your site appeared in search results\nAverage CTR (click-through rate): The percentage of impressions that resulted in a click\nAverage position: The average position of your site in search results\n\nTo review these metrics for your site, click “Search results” from the sidebar navigation.\n\nBelow the chart, you’ll see a table that shows which queries, pages, countries, and devices are driving traffic to your site. Plus, information on page experience and how many clicks you got by date.\n\nHere are two ideas of what to look for when analyzing your Google performance data:\n\nLow CTR: If your pages rank well but don’t get many clicks, consider writing better title tags and meta descriptions. This will make your pages more appealing to users.\nMissing keywords: If you don’t rank for important keywords, your site might not have enough useful content that addresses them. In that case, you need to improve your content strategy and produce quality content targeting terms you want to rank for.\n\nIf your website receives traffic from Discover and Google News, you’ll also see specific reports for these two segments.\n\nThe reports both look like this:\n\nURL Inspection Tool\n\nThe “URL inspection” tool helps you check the index status of an individual page on your website. And troubleshoot issues that may be preventing your page from appearing in Google’s search results.\n\nAccess the tool from the top bar or by clicking “URL inspection” from the navigation bar.\n\nTo check the index status of a particular page, paste the full URL in the inspect search box and press enter.\n\nYou will see results that include the following information:\n\nIndex status: Whether or not the page is indexed by Google\nLast crawl date: The date and time Google last crawled the page\nMobile usability: Whether the page meets Google’s mobile-friendly criteria\nStructured data: Whether the page includes structured data (and any related issues)\n\nThe tool also lets you test live URLs, which allows you to see how a page appears to Googlebot.\n\nTo use, click “TEST LIVE URL” at the top-right of the screen.\n\nFrom the results page, click “VIEW TESTED PAGE” > “SCREENSHOT.”\n\nYou can also use the URL inspection tool to request indexing for new pages on your site.\n\nPaste the full URL in the inspect search box and press enter. Then, click “REQUEST INDEXING.” \n\nThis can speed up the indexing process.\n\nPage Indexing Report\n\nThe “Page indexing” report is located under the “Indexing” section. It shows you which pages Google can find and index, plus any related issues. \n\nPages must be indexed to appear in search results. So it’s important to avoid any indexation problems.\n\nGo to “Indexing” > “Pages” on the sidebar.\n\nYou’ll see two tabs showing the number of indexed and non-indexed pages.\n\nIf you notice a sudden drop in the number of indexed pages, it could be a sign that something is wrong.\n\nScroll down to find out why your pages weren’t indexed.\n\nThere are many reasons why some of your pages may not be indexed.\n\nFor example, maybe your pages are returning “Not found (404)” errors. Or you added the “noindex” tag by mistake.\n\nThis report will help you identify the problem.\n\nTo drill down on a particular cause, click on an entry from the “Reason” column. \n\nYou’ll see a list of affected pages.\n\nAlong with a link to learn how to fix the issue at the very top.\n\nIf you implement any fixes, you can click “VALIDATE FIX” to help Google see that you made the changes. And hopefully index the affected pages.\n\nSitemaps Report\n\nThe “Sitemaps” report displays your sitemap submission history and alerts you of any issues with your submitted sitemap.\n\nTo access the report, navigate to “Sitemaps” from the sidebar.\n\nYou’ll find the following information:\n\nURL: The URL specified when you submitted your sitemap\nType: The type of sitemap (e.g., XML, RSS, etc.)\nSubmitted: The date you originally submitted the sitemap\nLast read: The last date Google crawled the sitemap\nStatus: The crawl status (e.g., “Success,” “Has errors,” or “Couldn’t fetch”)\nDiscovered pages: The total number of pages Google found in the sitemap\n\nMake sure the “Status” column reads “Success.” This means your sitemap was successfully processed without errors. \n\nHere’s an overview of what unsuccessful statuses mean, plus how you should approach them:\n\nHas errors: One or more errors are present in your sitemap. Review the errors listed and read Google’s guide to learn how to fix each one.\nCouldn’t fetch: GSC could not fetch your sitemap. Navigate back to the “URL inspection” tool and perform a live URL test to investigate the errors.\n\nClicking on your sitemap submission entry will lead you to a report for that specific sitemap.\n\nAnd clicking the “SEE PAGE INDEXING” button (highlighted above) will bring you to your sitemap’s “Page Indexing” report.\n\nThe report tells you whether all your sitemap pages are indexed. \n\nPage Experience Report\n\nThe “Page Experience” report provides information about a website’s performance in terms of user experience.\n\nUser experience is measured by the following criteria:\n\nCore Web Vitals: A set of metrics from Google that measure loading, interactivity, and visual stability of webpage content\nMobile Usability: Whether your site is usable on mobile devices\nHTTPS: Whether your site’s connection is secure\n\nTo review your site’s user experience, navigate to the “Page Experience” report in the left-hand sidebar. \n\nThe results are split between mobile:\n\nAnd desktop:\n\nThe percentage of “Good URLs” indicates how many URLs provide an optimal page experience to users.\n\nLook through each report to see where you fall short.\n\nFor example, 15 URLs from this property failed the Core Web Vitals test. And 224 URLs failed the Mobile Usability test.\n\nClick on these numbers for a full issues report.\n\nHere, we see that 15 URLs failed the Core Web Vitals test due to high LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) load times.\n\nClick on an entry to see which pages have the LCP issue.\n\nTo fix Core Web Vitals issues, we recommend getting help from a developer on your team. (Unless you’re highly experienced in technical SEO.)\n\nAfter you’ve fixed the issue, alert Google of the change by clicking “VALIDATE FIX” at the top section of the error report.\n\nEnhancements Report\n\nThe “Enhancements” report shows information about any structured data Google detects on your website. And whether any issues are present.\n\nStructured data provides Google with additional information about your page. Google uses this information to create rich results in the SERP. Which can potentially improve CTR for your pages.\n\nGoogle lists the types of structured data it detects under the “Enhancements” section in the sidebar.\n\nLike so:\n\nClick on a specific type for the full report. Here, we clicked on “Breadcrumbs.”\n\nThe report tells you whether there are any problems by indicating “Invalid” items.\n\nYour “Invalid” items should be zero. If there are any issues, the affected pages won’t appear as rich results in search results.\n\nManual Actions Report\n\nGoogle issues a manual action if a website breaches Google’s spam policies.\n\nWebsites with manual actions (or penalties) may rank much lower in Google search results—or may not rank at all.\n\nThis could lead to a huge loss of traffic.\n\nTo check whether you have a manual action from Google, visit the “Manual actions” report in Search Console.\n\nIf the report says “No issues detected,” you don’t need to do anything.\n\nBut if you see “Issues detected” in this report, you have a serious problem. And you need to address each issue immediately.\n\nLearn how to address specific penalties in Google’s guide to the manual actions report.\n\nLinks Report\n\nThe “Links” report helps you track your external links, or backlinks. Backlinks are links on other domains that point to your domain.\n\nAnd they’re an important Google ranking factor.\n\nTo view this report, navigate to “Links” on the sidebar.\n\nYou’ll see your site’s total number of backlinks at the top:\n\nUnder that, view your top linked pages—the ones receiving the most backlinks:\n\nPlus, which sites are linking to you most:\n\nAs well as the most common anchor text people use when they link to you:\n\nThe “Links” report also shows which pages on your site have the most internal links, or links from pages on your own domain.\n\nInternal links are important for SEO for two main reasons:\n\nThey help users and crawlers navigate your site more efficiently\nThey transfer authority to other pages on your site—which can help them rank higher\n\nFind information on your internal links to the right of the report.\n\nYou’ll see the total number of internal links, plus your top linked pages:\n\nShopping Report\n\nThe “Shopping” report is for online stores and product review sites that have implemented product markup on their websites.\n\nIt shows data about the issues with your product-related structured data.\n\nYou’ll see a combination of the following reports (depending on what kind of structured data Google finds on your site):\n\nProduct snippets: Detects structured data issues for product snippets in search results \nMerchant listings: Detects structured data issues for free listings across Google\nShopping tab listings: Detects structured data issues for items that appear in the Shopping tab in Google Search results\n\nNavigate to the specific report from the sidebar.\n\nAnd you’ll see whether there are any “Invalid” items.\n\nIf “Invalid” items are present, the affected pages won’t appear as rich results on Google.\n\nSo review \"Invalid\" items in the report to see what errors are present.\n\nAfter you fix the issues, use Google's Rich Results Test to check your structured data code.\n\nThe tool will let you know whether your new code is working. And whether your entry is eligible for a rich result.\n\nAMP Report\n\nAMP (formerly known as accelerated mobile pages) is an HTML framework developers use to create lightweight, fast-loading webpages.\n\nWhen Google detects AMP on your site, it creates a report in Search Console detailing those pages. And any issues preventing Google from indexing the AMP pages.\n\nTo access the report, click “AMP” from the navigation sidebar.\n\nThe summary report classifies your pages into two categories:\n\nValid pages: These pages are free from AMP-related issues and can appear in search results\nInvalid pages: These pages cannot appear in search results because they have certain issues\n\nScroll down to see the list of issues with your AMP pages.\n\nFix each issue so your AMP pages can start appearing in search results.\n\nWe recommend asking a developer for help in this case. Unless you’re an expert in this field.\n\nAfter you’ve fixed the issues, click “VALIDATE FIX” to ask Google to confirm your fixes.\n\nConnect Your Google Search Console Account to Semrush\n\nConnect your Google Search Console account to Semrush. This way, you can access insights about your website in one central location.\n\nYou’ll be able to integrate GSC data with tools like the On Page SEO Checker,Backlink Audit, My Reports, and more.\n\nPlus, you can view estimated competitor data within the same interface. \n\nReady to try out Semrush?
