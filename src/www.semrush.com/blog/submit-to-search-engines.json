  "content": "Submitting your website to a search engine helps you get more traffic from search. It gets the search engine to crawl your pages and decide whether (and how) to index them.\n\nThe best part? Submitting your site to search engines is free. You don’t need to use a paid service.\n\nThis article will walk you through the step-by-step process of submitting your site—or specific page URLs—to the Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and Yandex search engines.\n\nAnd how to use a tool like Site Audit to troubleshoot any indexing issues that occur after you’ve submitted your site.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nDo You Need to Submit Your Website to Search Engines?\n\nIt’s almost certain that search engines will eventually find your site. But adding your site to search engines has these benefits:\n\nPeace of mind: You’ve alerted search engines of your site’s existence, so you won’t have to wait and wonder\nFaster crawling: When you submit your site to a search engine, it may add it to its priority queue and crawl it sooner\nHigher rankings for relevant keywords: Search engines may be able to make more informed ranking decisions when you share your site structure instead of leaving them to figure it out\nHow to Submit Your Website to Google\n\nSubmitting a site to Google involves two main steps:\n\n1. Find Your XML Sitemap URL\n\nAn XML sitemap is a file that lists the pages on your site.\n\nFor example, here’s part of the XML sitemap for Semrush’s blog:\n\nWhen you provide search engines with your XML sitemap’s URL, they can visit the sitemap to discover—and then crawl—your site’s pages.\n\nA website’s XML sitemap URL is usually this:\n\nyoursite.com/sitemap.xml\n\nOr this:\n\nyoursite.com/sitemap_index.xml\n\nTry entering these URLs into your browser to view your site’s XML sitemap.\n\nIf this doesn’t work, your site’s robots.txt file might show the correct sitemap URL to use.\n\nAccess your site’s robots.txt file at this URL:\n\nyoursite.com/robots.txt\n\nAnd look for your sitemap URL in this file:\n\nFurther reading: WordPress Sitemap: How to Create, Check, and Submit One\n\n2. Add Your Sitemap to Google Search Console\n\nConnect Google Search Console (GSC) to your website if you haven’t already done so. After that, open GSC and click “Sitemaps” in the left sidebar.\n\nType your sitemap URL into the “Add a new sitemap” setting. Then, click “Submit.”\n\nIf Google successfully processes your sitemap, the status will say “Success.”\n\nFurther reading: How to Submit a Sitemap to Google (in 4 Simple Steps)\n\nHow to Submit Your Website to Bing\n\nAdd your site to Bing Webmaster Tools if you haven’t already. Then, open Bing Webmaster Tools and click “Sitemaps” in the left sidebar.\n\nClick “Submit sitemap” at the top right.\n\nA “Submit sitemap” pop-up will appear. Type your sitemap URL into the given field. And click “Submit.”\n\nIf Bing successfully processes your sitemap, the status will say “Success.”\n\nFurther reading: Bing Search Guide: History, AI Features, and SEO Tips\n\nHow to Submit Your Website to Yahoo\n\nBing powers Yahoo’s search engine. By submitting your website to Bing, you’ll also submit it to Yahoo.\n\nHow to Submit Your Website to DuckDuckGo\n\nDuckDuckGo draws most of its search results from Bing. So, submitting your website to Bing helps it appear on DuckDuckGo, too.\n\nHow to Submit Your Website to Yandex\n\nOpen Yandex Webmaster and verify your site.\n\nOnce your verification is complete, click “Indexing” > “Sitemap files” on the left sidebar.\n\nType your sitemap URL into the “Add Sitemap file” field, and then click “Add.”\n\nYandex will then add your sitemap to its processing queue. Processing may take one to two weeks. If it successfully processes your sitemap, the status will say “ok.”\n\nHow to Check if a Website Is Indexed\n\nSubmitting your website to a search engine doesn’t guarantee its appearance in the search results. That’s because there may be issues preventing the search engine from indexing your site’s pages.\n\nHere are two methods for checking if a search engine has indexed your website:\n\nRun an Online Search\n\nUse this search query:\n\nsite:yoursite.com\n\nThe search engine will return results from your site if it has indexed it:\n\nOtherwise, it will not show any results.\n\nThis method also checks if a search engine has indexed a specific page.\n\n(Note: This method is fairly reliable as a starting point but not a perfect source of truth about webpage indexation.)\n\nUse Google Search Console\n\nLog in to GSC and click “Pages” in the left sidebar. Then, click “View data about indexed pages.”\n\nScroll down to the “Examples” section to see a list of your site’s pages in the Google index. The report can show up to 1,000 URLs.\n\nAlternatively, here’s how to check if Google has indexed a specific page:\n\nType its URL into the “Inspect any URL in [your website]” search bar at the top of any GSC screen. Then, hit “Enter” or “return” on your keyboard.\n\nYou’ll see the message “Page is indexed” if Google has indexed the page.\n\nOtherwise, you’ll see this message: “Page is not indexed: URL is unknown to Google.”\n\nTip\n\nClick “Request indexing” to submit the webpage to Google again. This is useful if you want Google to re-index it because you’ve updated its contents or fixed its indexing issue.\n\nHow to Fix Indexing Issues\n\nIf your site has indexing issues, some (or all) of its pages won’t appear in the search results.\n\nAs a result, you’ll lose organic traffic.\n\nIndexing issues include:\n\n404 errors: The web server cannot find a page at that URL\nThe URL has a meta robots “noindex” tag: This tag tells search engines not to index the URL\nDuplicate content: Search engines may not index a page whose content is nearly identical to another page’s\n\nUse these tools to find and fix indexing issues:\n\nGoogle Search Console\n\nGo to GSC and click “Pages” in the left sidebar to load the “Page indexing” report.\n\nScroll down the report. Under the “Why pages aren’t indexed” section, you’ll see the number of pages Google isn’t indexing and the reasons.\n\nClick any indexing issue, and then scroll down to see why specific URLs aren’t getting indexed. You can view up to 1,000 examples.\n\nScroll back to the top of the page. Then, click “Learn more” to get Google’s explanation of the indexing issue and suggestions for fixing it, if available.\n\nSite Audit\n\nSite Audit is a tool that checks for over 140 technical site issues—including indexing problems. To use it, log in to your Semrush account and click “SEO” > “Site Audit” in the left sidebar.\n\nClick “+ Create project” to start a new site project.\n\nFill out your site’s domain and an optional project name. Then, click “Create project.”\n\nOn the “Configure basic settings” screen, set up the:\n\nCrawl scope: Whether Site Audit should check your site’s subdomains\nLimit of checked pages: The number of pages the tool should check each time\nCrawl source: The place where the tool can find your site’s URLs. Leave the setting as “Website” if you’re unsure.\n\nClick the steps numbered two to six on the left to configure optional settings. Like the URLs Site Audit should ignore.\n\nThen, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nSite Audit will scan your site for issues. When it’s done, click the “Issues” tab and choose “Indexability” from the “Category” drop-down.\n\nThe tool will display the indexing issues it detected on your site.\n\nClick any issue to view the pages experiencing it:\n\nThen, click “Why and how to fix it” to learn more about the issue and how to fix it.\n\nTip\n\nAfter fixing your page’s indexing issue(s), use GSC to submit its URL to Google for re-indexing.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nShould You Use a Website Submission Service?\n\nSubmitting your site to search engines directly is fast, easy, and free. So a search engine submission service is likely unnecessary.\n\nSome webpage submission services claim they can get your site onto little-known search engines and directories like Ask.com and Yippy.\n\nBut the vast majority of people use Google as their search engine. As of May 2024, its global market share was over 90.8%.\n\nSo, as long as your site is on Google, you’re in good shape.\n\nUsing a website submission service can also cause your SEO rankings to take a hit.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause some of these services involve you paying other sites to link to yours—which results in unnatural linking behavior that Google doesn’t like. If Google catches you doing this, it may penalize your site.\n\nSome links you buy may also be toxic backlinks that hurt your rankings. Semrush’s Backlink Audit can help you find and disavow these links. But it’s easier to avoid buying potentially harmful links in the first place.\n\nSo, stick with the search engines’ official website submission options.\n\nSubmitting your site to Google and other search engines isn’t complex and doesn’t take long. As long as you follow the steps, your URLs should be indexed in no time at all.\n\nBut if you encounter indexing issues after submitting your site, use Site Audit to troubleshoot and fix the problem.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →",
