  "content": "What Is Evergreen Content?\n\nEvergreen content is continually relevant to readers over an extended period of time—often several years. \n\nIt typically addresses common problems or questions many people have. And it doesn’t need frequent updates to remain relevant. \n\nFor example, a blog post about “how to write a book” is evergreen. The information doesn’t change and it’s a topic people will be interested in long term. \n\nSeasonal vs. Trending Content vs. Evergreen\n\nSeasonal content is only relevant at specific times in the year. Like content about Halloween or other time-specific holidays.\n\nTrending content is only relevant for a brief period of time. But the interest in the topic will slow down eventually.\n\nFor example, the interest for “Orange is the New Black” (a TV show) petered out after the show ended:\n\nEvergreen content remains more relevant compared to trending and seasonal content. It is not:\n\nA press release\nNews and current event articles\nResearch reports on topics that are outdated quickly\nHoliday-specific content\nFormats and Examples of Evergreen Content\n\nEvergreen content comes in many different formats. The most widely used formats are:\n\nHow-to guide or tutorial: A list of instructions to complete a specific task or learn a new skill\nFAQ: A piece that addresses common questions and problems in your niche\nGuide: A comprehensive resource that provides in-depth information on a specific topic\nListicle: A curated list of tips, recommendations, or resources relevant to your audience\nExpert interview: A published conversation with relevant industry experts\nCase study: A report that shows how your customer solved a problem using your products or services\nResource library: A collection of valuable tools, templates, or references in one place\nInfographic: A graphic that presents or illustrates information in a visual manner\n\nHere’s an example of an infographic we made about a case study:\n\nAnd see how paddleboard company Bluefin put together a comprehensive buyer’s guide to address buyer concerns:\n\nBenefits of Evergreen Content\nHigher Return on Investment\n\nEvergreen content often gives you a better return on your investment compared to trending content. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause its long-term topical relevance gives you a consistent stream of traffic, leads, and potential sales.\n\nFor example:\n\nSay you have an evergreen piece of content. And it generates five sales per day.\n\nYou also have a piece of trending content that goes viral. The viral content generates 400 sales over a few days. But eventually trickles down to zero.\n\nThe trending content might seem like a better value. But your evergreen content could end up producing over 1,800 sales each year (5 sales per day x 365 days).\n\nSo, if you want the most bang for your buck, focus on evergreen content.\n\nHigher Shareability\n\nEvergreen content usually gets more shares than trending topics.\n\nSince evergreen topics are always relevant, people will share them on social media year after year.\n\nThis means over time, you can build up more social shares.\n\nMore social shares will increase your brand exposure. And help you build credibility within your niche.\n\nMore Backlinks\n\nWebsites with lots of backlinks—links from one website that point to another website—often rank higher in the search results.\n\nAnd since evergreen content has a long lifespan, it tends to attract more backlinks. \n\nAs your backlinks grow, so will your site’s authority. Which means you’ll have a better chance of ranking higher in search results. And driving more visitors to your site.\n\nConsistent Traffic\n\nOptimizing evergreen content for search engines helps you drive a steady flow of traffic to your site.\n\nAnd unlike seasonal or trending content, you won’t need to worry about traffic waning throughout the year.\n\nLet’s look at a few real-life examples.\n\nTake Casper’s guide on “how to fix your sleep schedule.”\n\nThere are nearly 12,000 searches for four different variations of the primary keyword each month. \n\nBecause Casper’s guide ranks high, it gets around 1,400 monthly visitors from organic search:\n\nAnother great example of evergreen content is Calcuator.net’s Mortgage Calculator:\n\nThe search term “mortgage calculator” generates over 3.4M monthly searches in the United States.\n\nAnd because Calculator.net ranks on the first page, they get over 340,000 monthly visitors from organic search:\n\nHow to Create Evergreen Content in 4 Steps\n1. Choose a Topic\n\nTo create evergreen content, select a topic that is timeless and relevant to your audience. \n\nAsk yourself: \n\n“Is this something people will be interested in several years from now?”\n\nIf the answer is yes, the topic is likely evergreen. (We’ll show you how to confirm this in the following steps.)\n\nIf you’re unsure about a topic’s evergreen appeal, use the Topic Research tool. \n\nEnter your niche—we’ll go with “meditation” here. It’s optional to also indicate a domain.\n\nThen, select where your audience is from and click “Get content ideas.” \n\nGo through the topics and jot down ones you think are relevant to your audience.\n\nIn the next step, we’ll uncover evergreen keywords for your chosen topic.\n\n2. Conduct Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research helps you find keywords you can rank high for in search results.\n\nLet’s stick with the “meditation” topic from above. \n\nOne of the topics suggested is “meditation apps.” You might think that’s a good keyword in and of itself. But through keyword research, we can find even more keywords for that one topic.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nFirst, access the Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter your topic (we’ll use “meditation apps”), select your country, and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll get a list of keywords relevant to your topic.\n\nThere are plenty of unique keywords you can write about. Like “free meditation apps” or “christian meditation app.”\n\nDisplayed beside each keyword is a search intent category and monthly search volume. The Keyword Difficulty (KD %) column helps you determine how hard it is to rank for each one.\n\nGo through the list and pick a keyword that’s relevant to your audience. \n\nAfter picking a keyword, let’s confirm that it’s evergreen.\n\nClick the “>>” symbol next to your keyword. It will open up a keyword overview window. \n\nMake sure the blue bars shown in the “Trend” section are relatively stable. \n\nHere’s an example of how a seasonal keyword might look. In this example, the keyword is “christmas cookies”:\n\nIf your keyword isn’t evergreen, head back to the Keyword Magic tool and pick a new one.\n\nGet Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Choose Your Content Format\n\nPicking the right format helps your content resonate with your audience.\n\nFor example, you’ll likely want to use a listicle-style blog post format if you’re writing a blog post on “free meditation apps.”\n\nAnd if your keyword is “how to meditate,” the ideal format would be a how-to guide.\n\nIf you’re unsure which format is best, use the Keyword Overview tool to guide you. \n\nEnter your keyword and click “Search.” \n\nThen, scroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section.\n\nThis shows you which websites rank high for your keyword. \n\nClick on each website to read the content. Look for patterns and use a critical eye to determine which format will work best for your keyword.\n\nBut what if you don’t notice any patterns? \n\nFeel free to experiment. You can always revise and reformat your content down the road. \n\n4. Write and Publish Your Content\n\nGreat content has the potential to rank high in search results. Which brings you more traffic (and more business). \n\nFor help with writing content, use the SEO Writing Assistant. \n\nStart by clicking “+ Analyze new text.”\n\nClick the “Set a new goal” drop-down and enter at least two keywords. \n\nNext, input your content. You can write directly in the editor directly or paste your content in.\n\nThen, choose your target audience (desktop or mobile), input your keywords, and click “Get recommendations.”\n\nSEO Writing Assistant puts together recommendations to improve your content based on:\n\nReadability\nSEO\nTone of voice \nOriginality\n\nThis way, you’ll know exactly what’s needed to write content that ranks as high as possible in search results.\n\nBelow are a few more tips to keep in mind when writing quality evergreen content.\n\nGet Writing Recommendations\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\nAdd Visual Enhancements\n\nVisual enhancements like infographics and imagery break up the text and convey information more effectively.\n\nThey also make your content more shareable (since readers have more elements to share).\n\nTake a look at how bed retailer Dreams added an infographic to their article:\n\nAnd how Nike added photos of each Yoga pose to complement the accompanying text:\n\nHere are a few more ideas:\n\nAdd images with key pieces of information\nIncorporate charts or graphs that highlight important data points\nInclude screenshots or step-by-step images to illustrate a process or tutorial\nUse icons or symbols to emphasize key takeaways or sections\nUse Clear and Concise Language\n\nClear and concise language helps your content remain timeless.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nIndustry terms you use today may not be relevant in a few years. So, avoid jargon in your evergreen pieces. \n\nNext, clear language improves readability and allows a wider audience to enjoy your content. \n\nLastly, concise language helps maintain readers’ attention. Readers appreciate content that quickly delivers value without unnecessary fluff. \n\nAnd if your readers make it to the end of your article, they’ll be more likely to follow through on your call to action (CTA). \n\nAvoid Pop Culture References\n\nTo keep content fresh and relevant, avoid pop culture references. \n\nPop culture references are short-lived and put a lifespan on your content. \n\nFor example: \n\nThe documentary Tiger King took the world by storm in 2020. But a mere three years later, there’s barely any mention of it. Google Trends confirms this:\n\nEncourage User Interaction\n\nUser interaction keeps your content fresh long after you’ve published it.\n\nGive users a way to interact with each piece you create. Add things like social share buttons and a comment section to your blog posts. \n\nLike this review section for a recipe blog:\n\nAs a bonus, comment sections help you pinpoint ways to improve your content in the future.\n\nIf users continually ask the same question in the comments, it may mean you need to add key information to your piece.\n\nAdd Internal Links to Relevant Pieces\n\nInternal links—links that point to different pages on the same website—help search engines discover your content. So that your content can rank in the search results.\n\nInternal links also guide readers to other pieces of content they may find useful. This keeps users on your site for longer and establishes you as a valuable resource.\n\nUpdating Evergreen Content\n\nUpdating your content keeps it fresh. Which can help it rank higher and ensure you’re providing readers with timely information.\n\nHere are some examples of when you should update a piece of evergreen content:\n\nYour rankings are falling: Use our Position Tracking tool to keep a close eye on each keyword you rank for. Update your content when rankings start to slip.\nYou want to rank higher: Try reworking the content if you’re not ranking well for a keyword\nNew information was released: Update your content if new research comes out in your niche\nThere were changes in your industry: Keep an eye on best practices in your industry and make sure your content reflects those best practices\nYou updated your business: Make sure the information remains relevant to your business. If it’s not, spend time updating your content to reflect any changes that occurred. \nPromoting Evergreen Content for Maximum Impact\n\nConsistently promoting your content helps you grow your reach even faster.\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n1. Social Media\n\nSocial media is a great way to promote evergreen content without reinventing the wheel.\n\nRepurpose your content by sharing quotes, excerpts, and interesting facts from each piece.\n\nYou can schedule your social posts with Social Poster. \n\nJust follow these steps:\n\nAfter connecting your social account, click “New post.”\n\nCreate your post and click ”Schedule”:\n\nCreate multiple posts (scheduled at various intervals) for each piece of evergreen content. That way, you can continually promote your evergreen content in a (mostly) hands-off fashion.\n\n2. Email Marketing\n\nYour newsletter is a fantastic way to connect directly with folks who love your brand.\n\nAdd email sign-up forms directly to your blog posts to capture new leads. Here’s one from Mailchimp:\n\nThen, send out newsletters that promote each piece of evergreen content you publish.\n\n3. Guest Blogging\n\nGuest blogging helps you reach a new audience and acquire backlinks in one go.\n\nLet’s say you write a blog post about skydiving tips for your skydiving business.\n\nYou could seek a local tourism website and write a guest post for them about skydiving equipment. Then, within your guest post, you can link to your original blog post on skydiving tips.\n\nHere’s how to find guest posts:\n\nHead to Google and search “[your niche] + guest post” and “[your niche] + write for us.”\n\nThe query will yield websites that have published guest posts in the past. And are likely to publish them in the future.\n\nDo a second search for “[your niche] + write for us.”\n\nThis will bring up a list of sites with a “write for us” page. Indicating they are open to guest posts.\n\nGo through the websites and find ones that are good fits for your brand.\n\n4. Content Syndication\n\nContent syndication is when you republish your content on other reputable websites. It helps you reach a wider audience, gain backlinks, and drive traffic back to your site.\n\nTo find websites that republish content, try searching the following:\n\n“republished with permission” [keyword]\n“republished from” [keyword]\n“originally appeared on” [keyword]\n“syndicated from” [keyword]\n\nThis brings up different websites that have republished content in the past.\n\nSee if these sites have published any guidelines on content syndication. Then reach out to see if they’d allow you to republish your own content. \n\nImportant: Make sure to apply content syndication best practices so no republished content compromises your original page.\n\n5. Paid Ads\n\nYou can turn to paid ads to generate traffic to your content right away. By advertising your content with different platforms like Google Ads.\n\nTo make the most of your paid advertising strategy, encourage readers to share your content with social share buttons and clear CTAs. This helps you generate organic traffic even after you turn off the ads.\n\nMeasuring Performance of Evergreen Content\n\nMeasuring the right key performance indicators (KPIs) helps ensure your evergreen content performs its best.\n\nThe KPIs you track depend on your business and goals. We put together useful ones you might want to consider.\n\n1. Organic Search Sessions\n\nOrganic search sessions is free traffic that comes from search engines (not paid ads).\n\nHigh organic sessions means your evergreen content is ranking high. And that people are clicking on it in the search results.\n\nAnalytic tools—like Google Analytics 4 (GA4)—help you track and monitor organic sessions for each page (and piece of content) on your website.\n\nUpdate content with low (or falling) organic search sessions. The SEO Writing Assistant gives you tips on how to improve your content so it ranks higher.\n\n2. Average Engagement Time\n\nAverage engagement time is the length of time a user is focused on your website. If a user on your website switches tabs, they’re no longer considered engaged. \n\nYou want your average engagement time to be as high as possible. It means people enjoy your evergreen content.\n\nTap into the Organic Traffic Insights tool to view the average engagement time for each piece of evergreen content. Spot which pieces have lower-than-average engagement times.\n\nTwo reasons your average engagement time could be low:\n\nYour content doesn’t meet the searcher’s intent: Use the Keyword Overview tool to re-evaluate the keyword’s search intent\nPage readability is poor: Use the SEO Writing Assistant for tips to improve the readability of your content\n3. Backlinks\n\nBacklinks help your SEO and rankings. So, you want to make sure your evergreen content is getting backlinks. \n\nOne way to monitor backlinks to your evergreen content is through the Backlink Analytics tool. \n\nTo start, enter your domain and click “Analyze”:\n\nThen click the “Backlinks” tab:\n\nYou can see new and lost backlinks. Plus all your backlink sources. \n\nFilter the report by typing the URL for your evergreen content into the search bar:\n\nIdentify which which pages get the most backlinks and spend time promoting pages that aren’t getting many backlinks.\n\n4. Social Shares\n\nSocial shares refer to the number of times people have shared your content on social media. A high share amount means people love your content. \n\nTools like SharedCount tally up all your social shares per page.\n\nMonitor this information over time to see which pages perform best. \n\nHere are some ideas to encourage more people to share your evergreen content:\n\nAdd visible social share buttons\nInclude a clear CTA that asks users to share your piece\nUse ClickToTweet to pre-write a post for people to share on X (formerly Twitter)\nCreate Your Next Evergreen Piece of Content\n\nEvergreen content can help you create an SEO powerhouse.\n\nBut for that to happen, you need to identify which topics and keywords are evergreen to your audience.\n\nReady to get started? \n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool to find your next evergreen content idea.\n\nGet Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →",
