  "content": "Many online experiences start with a search engine.\n\nThis means search engines like Google and Bing are great for getting your products or services in front of potential customers. \n\nIn this article, we’ll explain everything about search engine marketing (SEM), its different components, and how it all works.\n\nBut first, let’s start by briefly comparing it to search engine optimization (SEO).\n\nSEO vs. SEM: What’s the Difference?\n\nGoogle something, and you’ll typically see two types of results: \n\nOrganic search results: Unpaid listings that appear on a search engine results page (SERP). They appear because the search engine’s algorithm has determined they’re relevant and helpful to the user’s search query.\nPaid search results: Paid advertisements that appear on the SERP. These results typically feature a “Sponsored” or “Ad” tag to distinguish them from organic results. Businesses using search ads pay a fee each time the ad is clicked, so paid search results are often called pay-per-click (PPC) ads.\n\nHere’s a SERP with both types of results:\n\nSEO focuses solely on improving organic search results.\n\nBut SEM includes both paid and organic search results. So, SEO is a subset of SEM.\n\nNow, let’s break down SEO vs. SEM in detail.\n\nWhat Is SEO?\n\nSEO is the process of improving your website to enhance its organic visibility on SERPs. \n\nThis typically includes creating and optimizing pages that address users’ search intent (the reason behind a search) for specific queries. \n\nPages with the most helpful and relevant content are more likely to appear in the first few organic search results. These are the results users see first.\n\nBut helpful content alone isn’t enough. It must be understandable to the bots (also called spiders and crawlers) that search engines use to crawl sites.\n\nHere’s how the process generally works for Google:\n\nYou publish or update a page on your website\nGoogle crawls your website and finds the new or updated page\nGoogle (hopefully)indexes your page\nGoogle (hopefully) ranks it as a search result for a certain query (or set of queries), so users can find it\n\nTo determine where a page should rank in search results, search engines use algorithms that evaluate various factors. \n\nAnd SEO tactics ensure that a website aligns with those search ranking factors. To increase the chance of ranking higher on SERPs. \n\nSome of Google’s broader and more consistent ranking factors include:\n\nRelevance: Does the content align with the user’s search query and provide the most helpful answer possible?\nQuality: Is the content trustworthy and authoritative? Search engines may assess this by looking at factors like backlinks (links from other reputable websites that point to your site) and the depth of the content.\nUser experience: How easy is the website to use? Things like site speed, mobile-friendliness, and clear navigation play a role.\n\nNow, there are many SEO tactics. These can be grouped into three broad categories: on-page SEO, off-page SEO, and technical SEO.\n\nHere’s an overview of each:\n\nOn-Page SEO\n\nOn-page SEO involves optimizing your webpage content for search engines. But it’s really about making those pages more helpful for users—not just search engines. \n\nYou can use Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker to improve your site’s on-page SEO.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your domain, and click “Get ideas.”\n\nFollow the steps to complete the configuration. Check out our in-depth setup guide if you need help with this.\n\nThe tool will then audit your pages. Once done, it’ll take you to the report. \n\nCheck the “TOP pages to optimization” widget. And click “# ideas” next to any page. \n\nYou’ll then be taken to the “Optimization Ideas” tab for that selected page.\n\nFollow the recommendations to improve your site’s on-page SEO.\n\nNow, let’s go over some common on-page SEO techniques to ensure your webpage content is as good as it can be from the start:\n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\n1. Create High-Quality, Authoritative Content\n\nGoogle prioritizes content that’s helpful and reliable. And a good way to ensure you’re meeting a high content quality standard is to consider Google’s Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust (E-E-A-T) guidelines that quality raters use when evaluating search results.\n\nBut quality isn’t just about credibility. It also means ensuring your content is unique.\n\nSearch engines value original content and tend to rank it higher in search results.\n\nFurther reading: How to Improve Your Site’s E-E-A-T\n\n2. Optimize for Relevant Keywords\n\nKeywords are the terms or phrases users input into search engines to find information. \n\nEffective on-page SEO requires two steps:\n\nIdentifying the most relevant keywords for your content\nIncorporating them in a natural way\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool can help you identify good keywords. \n\nOpen the tool, enter a seed keyword (a broad keyword related to your product or business), and enter “Search.”\n\nYou’ll find many keyword ideas here—plus data points like search volume, keyword difficulty (a measure of how difficult it will be to rank in the top 10 for a given keyword), and search intent.\n\nSelect the keywords that are most relevant to your business, click the “+ Add to list” button, and name your list.\n\nThen click the checkmark to add all your selected keywords to the Keyword Strategy Builder, where keywords will be automatically grouped. From there, you can manage and analyze all your keywords centrally.\n\nOnce you’ve identified keywords you want to target, you’ll then need to incorporate them into your content. By including them in headings and subheadings, body copy, etc.\n\nGet Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Write Descriptive Meta Tags\n\nMeta tags are elements of a page’s HTML code that help search engines understand what the page is about. And may influence how your page appears in search results.\n\nOne important type of meta tag is the title tag (sometimes called the meta title). It appears as the title of your page on SERPs. And it’s something search engines consider for rankings and can also influence whether users click through to your site.\n\nHere’s what a title tag looks like:\n\nAnother type of meta tag is the meta description, which summarizes the page’s content. Like this: \n\nWhile it doesn’t affect your rankings, a compelling meta meta description can influence a user to click on your search result over a competitor’s.\n\n4. Build a Network of Internal Links\n\nInternal links connect various pages within your website, creating a cohesive structure.\n\nStrategically linking related content pieces helps users navigate your site. And encourages deeper engagement.\n\nThese links also help search engine bots discover, crawl, and (hopefully) index your site’s pages.\n\n4. Maintain Clear URLs\n\nA URL should be descriptive and intuitive, offering both users and search engines insight into the page’s content.\n\nFor instance, a URL like “www.example.com/shop/black-umbrellas” immediately conveys the topic of the page compared to one with unclear characters.\n\nOff-Page SEO\n\nOff-page SEO includes all the activities you perform outside of your website to boost its visibility and rankings on search engines. \n\nHere are some common off-page SEO techniques:\n\n1. Build Quality Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are links from other websites that point to your site. They’re also called inbound links.\n\nThink of each backlink as a vote of confidence in your site. When reputable and relevant sites link to yours, search engines take note. \n\nAnd sites with a stronger backlink profile are generally considered more trustworthy and authoritative—meaning they often rank higher on SERPs.\n\nBut it’s not just the number of backlinks that matters. It’s also the quality of the domain they come from. \n\nA few links from one or two high-authority sites can be more beneficial than many links from lesser-known sites or those with less credibility.\n\nYou can use Semrush’s Link Building Tool to discover link-building opportunities based on your target keywords and competing sites.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your domain, and click “Start Link Building.”\n\nIn the next steps, you’ll be prompted to enter your top competitors and target keywords. You can follow our in-depth setup guide to configure the Link Building Tool.\n\nOnce done, you’ll see this screen:\n\nGo to the “Prospects” tab. Review all the URLs and click “To In Progress” next to each of the sites you want to get backlinks from.\n\nNext, head over to the “In Progress” tab. You’ll be able to create and manage all your link-building email outreach activities from here. \n\nYou may need to test out different outreach tactics before you find one that works. And with a little patience, you can start getting more backlinks to your website.\n\nBuild Backlinks Easily\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Invest in Local SEO\n\nLocal SEO focuses on optimizing a business’s online presence to attract customers from local searches.\n\nHere’s an example of how local listings appears on Google:\n\nGoogle Business Profile is a key part of local SEO on Google. And because making improvements to it is something that occurs outside of your own site, it falls under off-page SEO.\n\nOptimizing your Google Business Profile can increase your visibility for local searches. And it also displays your reviews. Which act like endorsements from the community.\n\n3. Write Guest Blog Posts\n\nPublishing a guest blog post on a third-party website won’t directly affect your site’s rankings. \n\nBut this tactic can still help your SEO efforts—especially if the website in question is a reputable one in your industry.\n\nGuest blogging positions you as an expert in your field and (sometimes) provides opportunities to link back to your site.\n\nBut you should always prioritize quality and relevance when choosing platforms for guest blogging.\n\nFor example here’s an example of a guest post written by Semrush’s Marcus Tober for Adweek:\n\n4. Gain Brand Mentions\n\nBrand mentions are when other websites talk about or reference your brand, even if they don’t directly link back to your site.\n\nSearch engines are always listening to these digital conversations. So, when your brand gets mentioned by an authoritative or popular website, it acts as a signal that reinforces your brand’s reputation and authority.\n\nOver time, consistent and positive brand mentions can contribute to a stronger online presence. Which may lead search engines to rank your content higher in search results.\n\nYou can monitor your brand mentions using the Media Monitoring app. Just enter your brand name and create a project.\n\nYou’ll get a report listing your most recent mentions. You can also see what percentage of those mentions are positive, negative, and neutral.\n\nTechnical SEO\n\nTechnical SEO ensures your site is optimized for search engines and to improve the user experience. Think of it as the under-the-hood work.\n\nYou can check your site for technical SEO issues using Site Audit.\n\nYou’ll first need to create a project for your domain. Follow our in-depth setup guide if you need help with the configuration.\n\nOnce the website is crawled, you’ll see this “Overview” report:\n\nNavigate to the “Issues” tab. \n\nReview all the technical issues your website has. Then, address them one by one.\n\nYou can click “Why and how to fix” to learn more about each issue. And what it takes to fix the issue.\n\nNow, let’s go over how you can focus on avoiding these types of issues from the beginning.\n\nFind and Fix Sitemap Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n1. Ensure Your Site Is Mobile-Friendly\n\nMost searches occur on mobile devices now. So, having a mobile-friendly website is no longer optional.\n\nYou must ensure your site looks and performs seamlessly on smartphones and tablets. Like this:\n\nTo ensure your site looks great on all device types, it’s best to use responsive design. \n\n2. Craft a Clear XML Sitemap\n\nThink of an extensible markup language (XML) sitemap as a roadmap for search engines. It lists all the important pages on your website and helps search engines find new or updated content.\n\nHere’s an example of what an XML sitemap looks like:\n\nYou can easily create, check, and submit an XML sitemap for your site. Which helps search engines more easily crawl your site’s pages. To help with indexing.\n\n3. Use HTTPS\n\nHypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP and ensures that the data shared between your website and visitors is encrypted. \n\nBy migrating your site from HTTP to HTTPS, you can safeguard your users’ data. And signal to search engines that your site is trustworthy.\n\nSearch engines give preference to secure sites.\n\n4. Optimize Your Core Web Vitals\n\nThe Core Web Vitals (CWV) are a set of metrics to measure user experience on your site.\n\nThey focus on loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability. And because they’re centered on page experience, they can affect your rankings.\n\nSpecifically, those metrics are:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP): This measures how long it takes for your page’s main content to load. Google recommends this be 2.5 seconds or less. \nFirst Input Delay (FID): This measures how long it takes before a user is able to interact with your page. This metric should be 100 milliseconds or fewer. Note that this will be replaced with a metric called Interaction to Next Paint (INP) in March 2024.\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS): This measures how often users experience shifts in your page’s layout. Aim for 0.1 or less.\n5. Manage Redirects and Address Errors\n\nYou can ensure smooth navigation across your site and minimize dead ends by setting up proper redirects. \n\nRedirects automatically send users from one URL to another. You can set them up for pages that have been deleted or moved to a new URL. \n\nA proper redirect plan helps you avoid 404 errors, which occur when a page doesn’t exist or can’t be found.\n\nIt’s generally best to use a 301 redirect for a permanent move and a 302 redirect for a temporary move.\n\nWhat Is SEM?\n\nSearch engine marketing is a broad term that includes everything about SEO we’ve discussed so far. And it also encompasses the PPC search ads you see on many SERPs.\n\nYou’ll see search PPC search ads in two distinct formats.\n\nOne is text-based. These ads often resemble organic search results but with a “Sponsored” or “Ad” label. \n\nThe other type is shopping ads that showcase product images, prices, and more.\n\nTo better understand the SEM vs. SEO comparison, let’s look at the key components of paid search ads:\n\nNote\n\nSince text-based ads are usually what people refer to when they say “PPC ads,” we’ll focus on those in the coming sections.\n\nPPC Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research in PPC involves identifying the keywords that are relevant to your business and aligned with your campaign goals. \n\nBy focusing on the right keywords and targeting criteria (more on that in a moment), you can ensure your ads reach the right audiences.\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool can help you find the best keywords for your campaign. \n\nJust follow the same process we outlined earlier. But focus on keywords that align with what you want to achieve. \n\nFor instance, if you own a running shoe store in New York City, you might want your ad to appear when someone in New York City searches the keywords “buy running shoes” or “sports footwear sale.” \n\nPPC Bidding\n\nWith PPC, you decide how much you’re willing to pay for a click on your ad. This is called a bid. \n\nHere’s an example showing the total bid range for target keywords in Google Ads:\n\nBid management involves strategically setting this amount to maximize your return on investment (ROI). It’s a balance between wanting your ad to appear prominently in the search results and ensuring you don’t overspend. \n\nFor instance, if you sell handmade shoes and set a bid of $1, you’re telling the search engine you’re willing to pay up to $1 each time someone clicks your ad. \n\nPPC Audience Targeting\n\nFor PPC search ads, audience targeting lets you specify certain criteria for who you want your ads to show for.\n\nFor example, if you run a local bakery in New York, you might target people within a 10-mile radius who’ve shown an interest in baked goods. \n\nThis way, you’re not wasting money on ads shown to someone in California or someone who’s only interested in fitness products.\n\nHere’s an example of some of the interest-based targeting options in Google Ads:\n\nPPC Ad Creation\n\nPPC search ads need to communicate your message quickly and effectively. Which involves crafting a catchy headline, a relevant description, and a clear call to action (CTA).\n\nHere’s an example of an attention-grabbing search ad for the keyword “salesforce alternative.” Note the interesting headline, info-packed description, and clear CTA:\n\nWhen writing search ad copy, a good idea is to look at your competitors and learn from their ads.\n\nSemrush’s Advertising Research tool can help. Simply enter a competitor’s domain and navigate to the “Ads Copies” tab and check out their ads.\n\nAnalyze the emotional hooks they’re using and the keywords they’re targeting. \n\nIf any of this messaging strikes you as particularly effective, consider testing a similar approach.\n\nPPC Ad Assets\n\nPreviously known as ad extensions, assets are additional elements you can add to your Google PPC search ads to provide users with more information.\n\nThey come in various forms, such as a clickable call option:\n\nOr a business address:\n\nIf you run a spa, a location asset would show searchers your exact address. And a call asset would offer a direct line to book appointments.\n\nIncorporating these assets can help your ads drive more conversions.\n\nWhat’s the Cost of SEO vs. SEM?\n\nThe relative costs of SEO and SEM can vary significantly.\n\nSEO may be unpaid, but it’s not necessarily free. Doing SEO the right way means investing in website optimization, content production, backlink outreach, and SEO tools.\n\nHow much does that add up to? It depends. \n\nA local business will likely spend less on SEO than a multinational company due to differing goals and competition levels. \n\nAccording to Backlinko data from 2019, the average cost of SEO services at that time was about $500 per month. Just note that your budget may differ greatly depending on your goals.\n\nSEM, on the other hand, includes all SEO expenses plus what you allocate for creating and managing PPC campaigns.\n\nOne study found that typical PPC costs can range from $100 to $10,000 per month.\n\nThis cost difference means that many businesses with a limited budget might be tempted to stick to organic tactics in the early stages of growth. \n\nBut keep in mind that paid campaigns tend to generate results much faster, which can be crucial for companies that need to start driving more business.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to See SEM Results? \n\nResults aren’t instant with SEO. After making website changes or adding new content, it can take months to see a rise in organic rankings and traffic. \n\nPPC is quicker. Once a campaign is set up and approved, your ads can appear immediately. \n\nBut quick visibility doesn’t always mean instant success. Your ad might get clicks immediately, but refining it to achieve the best results can take some time.\n\nIn short, SEO is a slow build with a potentially good payoff. And PPC offers immediate results that can be honed and improved over time.\n\nAn effective SEM strategy usually incorporates both to better address short- and long-term goals. And different types of search intent.\n\nWhich SEM Practice Is Right for You?\n\nBoth SEM practices have their advantages and use cases. Which one you should focus on largely depends on your goals, budget, and timeline.\n\nHere’s when to think about prioritizing SEO:\n\nWhen you have a limited budget\nWhen you’re planning for the long term\nWhen you’re targeting informational intent keywords\nWhen you want to build your reputation and credibility \n\nAnd here’s when to think about prioritizing PPC:\n\nWhen you want immediate results\nWhen you’re targeting transactional keywords\nWhen you want precise budget and targeting control\nWhen you want measurable and quick results\n\nBut you should ideally have a comprehensive SEM strategy that incorporates both SEO and paid search to help you meet your immediate goals while still setting the stage for future success.\n\nBuild an Integrated SEM Strategy\n\nIf you want to boost online visibility for your business, you need a robust SEM approach that draws on both paid and unpaid tactics.\n\nStart by assessing your needs, goals, and budget. \n\nThen, build an integrated search engine marketing plan where SEO and PPC complement each other to help you achieve your goals.\n\nAnd remember, keyword research is at the heart of both SEO and PPC efforts.
