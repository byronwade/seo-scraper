  "content": "What Is an Analytics Dashboard?\n\nAn analytics dashboard displays real-time performance metrics for a website, department, or project—usually in the form of interactive charts.\n\nFor example, Google Analytics allows you to build web analytics dashboards that visualize website traffic, conversion rates, etc.\n\nLike this: \n\nThe Semrush Single Project Dashboard, on the other hand, shows you domain analytics, keyword positions, backlink metrics, site health, and on-page SEO suggestions.\n\nUsers can click each part of the dashboard to access more in-depth reports.\n\nWhy Use Analytics Dashboards?\n\nAnalytics dashboards make it quick and easy to understand real-time business performance in a particular area (e.g., digital marketing). \n\nThis means stakeholders can track progress toward goals without having to dig through lots of data. Or ask colleagues for custom reports.\n\nPlus, teams can identify performance issues (and take action) more quickly.\n\nLet’s say two websites experience a sudden traffic drop due to a technical issue:\n\nWebsite A monitors a website analytics dashboard daily. They quickly notice and investigate the traffic drop. So, they fix the issue before it causes much harm.\nWebsite B only checks traffic metrics at a monthly reporting meeting. They don’t notice and address the traffic drop until four weeks later. After they’ve lost lots of potential sales.\n\nIn addition to real-time performance monitoring, analytic dashboards also help with creating in-depth reports.\n\nReports document performance over a certain time period. They assist with record-keeping and allow more “hands-off” stakeholders to get regular updates.\n\nPlus, there’s scope to go in-depth and include information from other sources (e.g., competitor analysis). That’s why reports beat dashboard analytics for long-term planning.\n\nTip\n\nHead to My Reports in Semrush to create automated marketing reports every day, week, or month. You can combine data from Semrush, Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Google Business Profile, and more.\n\nHow to Create a Data Analytics Dashboard\n\nHere’s how to create an analytics dashboard, step by step:\n\n1. Define the Dashboard’s Purpose\n\nFirst, define the purpose of the analytics dashboard.\n\nYou’ll need to consider who will use the dashboard and what questions it should answer.\n\nFor example, your marketing team might want to create an SEO dashboard that answers:\n\nWhich search queries do we rank for in Google?\nHow much organic traffic (unpaid search engine traffic) do these rankings drive?\nWhat percentage of organic visitors take a desired action (e.g., make a purchase)?\n\nEnsure your dashboard’s scope isn’t too broad, or it will become bloated and difficult to navigate.\n\nThe right choice depends on your business’s size and goals.\n\n2. Choose What Metrics to Include\n\nWhat data to include in an analytics dashboard depends on the purpose of your dashboard.\n\nHere are some of the most common types of analytics dashboards and metrics they typically include:\n\nAnalytics Dashboard Type\n\n\t\n\nCommonly Used Metrics\n\n\n\n\nWebsite/web\n\n\t\n\nWebsite traffic, conversion rate, bounce rate\n\n\n\n\nDigital marketing\n\n\t\n\nBlog traffic, average time on page, email open rate\n\n\n\n\nSEO\n\n\t\n\nKeyword rankings, organic traffic, backlinks\n\n\n\n\nPPC\n\n\t\n\nClick-through rate, impressions, cost per click\n\n\n\n\nSocial media\n\n\t\n\nFollowers, impressions, engagement rate\n\n\n\n\nEcommerce\n\n\t\n\nAverage order value, cart abandonment rate, unique visitors \n\n\n\n\nB2B sales\n\n\t\n\nSales revenue, average deal size, lead response time\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\t\n\nChurn rate, daily active users, customer lifetime value\n\n\n\n\nCustomer service\n\n\t\n\nTicket volume, average response time, customer satisfaction score\n\n\n\n\nFinancial\n\n\t\n\nMonthly recurring revenue, gross profit, net profit\n\nIn the next section, we’ll explain where to find these metrics.\n\nBuild an SEO Dashboard\n\nwith Semrush’s SEO Toolkit\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Identify Data Sources\n\nNext, work out where to collect the raw data you need.\n\nIf you’re creating a web analytics dashboard, your content management system (CMS) might have analytics built in.\n\nFor example, Shopify (an ecommerce platform) has an Analytics page that allows users to track metrics like total sales and average order value.\n\nImage source: Daasity\n\nAlternatively, you can set up GA4. Or a Google Analytics alternative like Clicky, Mixpanel, or Fathom Analytics.\n\nYou’ll need to create an account and install a tracking code on your site.\n\nOther common sources for data analytics dashboards include:\n\nDigital marketing tools like Semrush\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) tools like HubSpot and Salesforce\nInternal databases and spreadsheets\nFinancial systems like QuickBooks and Xero\nSocial media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn\nEmail marketing platforms like Mailchimp\n4. Choose a Dashboard Creation Tool\n\nNext, decide where to create your data analysis dashboard.\n\nMany analytics platforms (or tools with analytical features) have built-in, customizable dashboards. And some offer integrations that let you import data from elsewhere.\n\nFor example, project dashboards in Semrush display data from various tools.\n\nAnd you can add or remove widgets as you please.\n\nYou can also collect real-time data from GA4 and Google Search Console.\n\nSo, make sure to check functionality in the tools you use to collect data. (And take these features into account when you’re next comparing tools.)\n\nAlternatively, use a data visualization platform.\n\nData visualization platforms allow you to import data from multiple sources. And tend to offer more customizations.\n\nBut, if you’re not a data analyst, they can be more difficult to use.\n\nGoogle Looker Studio is one of the most popular choices. It’s a free tool that lets you import and visualize data from various sources, including Semrush.\n\nHere’s an analytics dashboard example featuring data from Semrush’s Domain Overview tool:\n\nGet started with our Google Looker Studio tutorial and templates.\n\nOr check out alternative tools like Microsoft Power BI and Tableau. \n\nThe right platform for your needs depends on the data integrations, customizations, security features, and collaboration options available. In addition to your budget.\n\n5. Design and Share Your Dashboard\n\nYou’re now ready to customize or build your analytics dashboard.\n\nHere are some tips to bear in mind, depending on your platform:\n\nPlace the most important metrics near the top of the dashboard\nGroup metrics by type so it’s easier to absorb information\nUse the most appropriate visualization for each type of data\nInclude benchmarks and/or goals to put numbers into context\nInclude data from a time range that makes sense for your needs (e.g., last 30 days)\n\nWhen you’re finished, share your analytics dashboard with relevant stakeholders.\n\nAnd gather feedback over time.\n\nAsk relevant stakeholders to share:\n\nWhich metrics they use the most\nWhich metrics they think are missing\nAnything they find hard to use or understand\n\nThis will allow you to make iterative improvements to your analytics dashboard.\n\nAnalytics Dashboard Examples\n\nIf you need inspiration, check out these analytics dashboard examples: \n\nSEO Analytics Dashboard Example\n\nSEO analytics dashboards help users track performance of their SEO strategy. In other words, how visible their business is in organic (unpaid) search engine results. And what benefits this visibility drives.\n\nThese dashboards are primarily used by digital marketers.\n\nHere’s an SEO dashboard created in Semrush:\n\nAt the top, we get a snapshot of the domain’s organic performance. And how this has changed over the past 30 days.\n\nUnderneath are highlights from the Position Tracking tool, which monitors the domain’s Google rankings. The “Visibility” metric makes it easy to understand overall performance over time.\n\nFurther down, we’ll find summaries from tools including:\n\nSite Audit, which checks for technical SEO issues on the domain\nOn Page SEO Checker, which provides optimization ideas\nBacklink Audit, which checks for potentially harmful links from other sites\n\nSemrush also offers integrations with Google Search Console and GA4. So you can view all your data in one dashboard. \n\nNot sure which metrics to track? Check out our guide to SEO KPIs.\n\nWeb Analytics Dashboard Example\n\nWeb analytics dashboards are designed to summarize how users interact with a site. They’re primarily used by digital marketers and user experience (UX) engineers.\n\nHere’s an example from the Google Analytics demo account:\n\nBy default, it presents data from the last 28 days.\n\nIn the upper left, we can see key metrics (users, new users, average engagement time, and total revenue) at a glance. And easily access line charts that show trends over time.\n\nIn the upper right, we can see real-time information about the number of users over the past 30 minutes. And which countries they came from.\n\nFurther down, there are more charts and graphs.\n\nAs with most Google Analytics dashboards, we can customize the data shown. And click through to more in-depth reports.\n\nNot sure which metrics to track in your dashboard? Check out our marketing KPIs guide.\n\nKeyword Rankings Dashboard Example\n\nA keyword rankings dashboard is a type of SEO dashboard that focuses on keyword performance. In other words, where the domain ranks for search terms it cares about.\n\nHere’s an example built in Google Looker Studio using Semrush data: \n\nWhile the line graphs make it easy to understand overall performance, the “Positions” table provides detailed information about target keywords. \n\nIncluding:\n\nWhich page on the domain ranks highest and what position it’s in\nWhat special elements (SERP features) appear on the search engine results page (SERP)\nThe keyword search volume (average number of monthly searches)\n\nAll this data comes from Semrush’s Position Tracking tool, which has a built-in dashboard that looks like this:\n\nRead our dedicated guide to learn more about tracking Google rankings.\n\nTrack Your Rankings with Ease\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nSocial Media Analytics Dashboard Example\n\nSocial media analytics dashboards help users track their performance on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn. They’re primarily used by social media managers.\n\nHere’s a social analytics dashboard example created with Semrush Social:\n\nAt a glance, we can see multiple social accounts are performing. And check for any issues that might require intervention (e.g., a lack of posts in the past few days).\n\nThis dashboard streamlines social media management and reporting, because it eliminates the need to check analytics on each platform and account.\n\nFor more advice, check out our guide to social media KPIs.\n\nTrack and Improve Your Business Results with Semrush\n\nSemrush makes it easy to collect important business metrics.
