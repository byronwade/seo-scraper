Semrush: Level Up Your Online Visibility\n\nSemrush is an all-in-one platform that helps you boost your online visibility and marketing performance.\n\n10 million digital marketing professionals have used Semrush tools and the platform is a marketing staple for 30% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nBut this toolkit isn’t just for massive or established businesses.\n\nWith a Semrush account, you get access to over 55 tools and reports, along with a database of 25 billion keywords for 130 countries, 808 million web domains, and over 43 trillion backlinks. \n\nThe toolkit supports users with:\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO)\nContent marketing\nMarket and keyword research\nCompetitor research\nPay-per-click (PPC) advertising\nSocial media\n\nSome of the best Semrush tools to start with are Site Audit, Keyword Magic Tool, and Market Explorer.\n\nHere’s how they work:\n\nSite Audit\n\nThe Site Audit tool analyzes the health of your website for issues that affect search performance and user experience.\n\nYou can use it to see where your website struggles and fix problems before they become crises.\n\nEnter your URL and hit “Start Site Audit.”\n\nThe tool scans your site for over 140 issues, such as duplicate meta descriptions, slow load speeds, and broken internal links. When the report is ready, click the “Issues” tab to highlight the top errors and warnings.\n\nErrors like duplicate meta descriptions and title tags are priority issues to address, as they pose immediate threats to your website’s search performance or usability. \n\nWarnings, like images with missing alt text, are issues of medium severity. They’re less harmful to your site, but fixing them will still help your website perform better.\n\nClick “Why and how to fix it” next to any error or warning to learn more about the issue and how to solve it. \n\nThese tooltips explain how each issue affects your website, why it’s important to fix, and what action to take next. Even users with limited understanding of how websites work can address problems quickly.\n\nKeyword Magic Tool\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool lets you dive into more than 25 billion keywords to get ideas for your content.\n\nType in a seed keyword (a broad term relating to your products, services, brand, or industry) and it will return as many as thousands of keyword suggestions you can use to inspire relevant content.\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool sorts the results by metrics such as search volume, search intent, and keyword difficulty.

Clicking “View details” on any of the visible options will take you to Traffic Analytics. There, you can identify popular channels to target, like referrals, organic search, and paid social. \n\nFor example, if your closest competitor gets most of their traffic from paid social ads, this tactic could help increase your traffic, too.\n\nThe “Audience Overview” tab gives you a summary of any site’s visitor demographics. This can help you build out robust buyer personas for your marketing campaigns.\n\nSay you’re launching into a new market. You can use data on your competitors’ visitors to learn who’s most interested in the types of products or services you sell. \n\nYou can also use the data found in the “Behavior” section to refine your targeting.

Google Analytics: Understand Your Customers’ Journey\n\nGoogle Analytics (GA) tells you everything you need to know about how users find and interact with your website so you can improve the user experience.\n\nThere’s almost no end to GA’s valuable insights but some of the most accessible and immediately useful metrics for new users are:\n\nSessions: Measures user interaction on a site during a continuous period.\nPageviews: Indicates the total number of pages viewed by users.\nBounce rate: Measures the percentage of single-page visits where users exit without interaction.\nConversion rate: Reflects the percentage of users completing a desired action.\nAverage session duration: Provides the average time users spend on the site during a session.\nSource/medium: Identifies the origin of traffic, so you can see which marketing channels are most effective.\nTop pages: Highlights the most visited pages, informing content and strategy optimization.\nUser demographics: Provides insights into audience location, age, and gender to improve targeting.\n\nYou can also learn what users do after they arrive on your site, such as which pages they visit and what actions they take, as well as which browsers and devices they use.\n\nYou can use this data to:\n\nAssess website performance\nSee if your marketing strategy works\nFind content types and keywords to target\nIdentify pages to optimize to increase conversion rates\nGenerate custom reports for stakeholders and/or clients\n\nUnlike Google Search Console, which shows you how users find your website through Google’s organic search results, Google Analytics covers all traffic sources.\n\nThis includes organic and paid search, social media, and email, painting a clearer picture of how well your multi-channel marketing campaigns perform.\n\nBetter still, you can connect Google Analytics with other analytics tools like Semrush, Google Ads, and Google Search Console to expand your insights and improve SEO and PPC campaigns.\n\nPrice\n\nFree with a Google account.\n\nFurther reading: To get accurate data, make sure yourGoogle Analytics is set up correctly by following our five-step guide\n\n17. Slack: Unite Teams with Instant Communication\n\nSlack is a messaging app that facilitates real-time team communication and organizes collaborative activities—like discussions, file-sharing, and project work—into neat, easy-to-find channels. \n\nThe resulting benefit is fewer silos and, thus, smoother collaboration on marketing campaigns.\n\nInstead of relying on email to update each other on tasks, Slack brings marketing teams together in one place so you can chat in real time, the same way you would with friends on WhatsApp. \n\nThe channel aspect is where Slack gets its unique value. \n\nFor example, marketers can have a designated channel for discussing marketing tasks, while sales, support, and other teams have spaces, too. These teams can then communicate with one another as necessary, or create new, cross-departmental channels for more specific projects.\n\nWith Slack, you can:\n\nMessage anyone in your organization\nCommunicate in dedicated channels (e.g., marketing, fun, general chat, etc.)\nShare images, documents, and videos\nCreate to-do lists and set reminders\nHost voice calls, video calls, and small group meetings (known as “Huddles”)\nCreate polls\n\nYou can also connect Slack with your other apps to pull in information.\n\nFor example, you can send Google Calendar events and deadlines, host Zoom calls, or get Hubspot CRM notifications directly in Slack.\n\nUltimately, Slack helps information flow in an organized way across your business, ensuring marketers have the insights they need from colleagues, other teams, and even clients to complete tasks quickly and with confidence.\n\nPrice\n\nSlack offers a free plan and three paid subscriptions:\n\nPro: $7.25 per month\nBusiness+: $12.50 per month\nEnterprise Grid: Price set based on your requirements\n\nSlack’s free plan is a great starting point for small teams who only need one-on-one meetings, 90 days of data storage, and a single channel. Otherwise, a paid plan is the way to go.\n\n18. Unbounce: Create Landing Pages That Convert\n\nUnbounce is a powerful content builder that marketers can use to create and optimize landing pages without any coding skills.\n\nTake advantage of its intuitive page builders (the drag-and-drop Classic Builder and AI-powered Smart Builder) for quickly designing professional, high-converting landing pages.\n\nA/B testing capabilities let you experiment with elements like headlines, images, and calls-to-action to identify the most effective variations.\n\nUnbounce’s clever use of AI means it can do much more than other content creation tools. The app’s Smart Traffic feature analyzes visitors’ attributes and automatically shows them the page most likely to resonate with them—ultimately making your whole website more impactful. \n\nThe company says these tools can result in up to 30% higher conversion rates than old-fashioned A/B testing.\n\nUnbounce also connects with popular tools like Calendly and Typeform. So you can add meeting scheduling and forms to your landing pages to capture details for your marketing campaigns.\n\nPrice\n\nUnbounce offers a 14-day free trial and four paid plans:\n\nLaunch: $99 per month\nOptimize: $145 per month\nAccelerate: $240 per month\nConcierge: $625 per month\n\nSave a whole 25% on the cost of Unbounce by paying your bill annually rather than monthly.\n\nFurther reading: What is aLanding Page?

Grammarly: Optimize your Written Content\n\nGrammarly is an AI-powered writing app you can use to create polished, professional marketing copy fast without any copywriting experience.\n\nMost people know Grammarly as an in-browser spelling and grammar checker, but it helps marketers in various other ways. \n\nUse it to:\n\nSpot misused and commonly confused words in blog posts and articles\nMake your internal and external communiques concise and easy to understand\nMake your landing page content and CTAs more engaging to readers\n\nYou can also view and download performance reports that grade the quality of your writing, and set goals to get tailored suggestions based on your objectives and audience.
