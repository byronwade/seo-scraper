Target the Right Keywords\n\nTargeting the right keywords is crucial for driving more organic search traffic to your website.\n\nBefore you go ahead and create content, make sure to perform keyword research. To determine the most optimal keywords you should try to rank your website for.\n\nHere, your goal is to understand which keywords your target audience uses to find information through search engines like Google. And then prioritize those keywords based on criteria like: \n\nConversion potential: How likely is it that people who are searching for this keyword will convert into customers?\nSearch volume: How many people are searching for this keyword every month?\nKeyword difficulty: How difficult is it going to be to rank for this keyword?\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to find the right keywords to target for your website.\n\nStart by entering a seed keyword—a broad word or phrase closely related to your business. Then, type in your domain (for personalized results) and hit “Search.”\n\nThe tool will then generate thousands of keyword ideas. You’ll be able to see the search volume, keyword difficulty, search intent, and other important information for each keyword.\n\nFrom here, filter the keywords further to find the best ones to target for your website.\n\nWhich keywords you’ll go for will depend on your SEO strategy. In many cases, you’ll want to prioritize keywords with commercial or transactional intent.\n\nThese are keywords where searchers are either researching products or services or are ready to make a purchase.\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool makes it easy to find these keywords. All you need to do is use the “Intent” drop-down filter and select the “Commercial” and “Transactional” options.\n\nThis will filter the list to only show keywords with commercial or transactional intent. \n\nBut you can then narrow down the list even further. For example, maybe you only want to see keywords with at least 100 monthly searches that are easy to rank for.\n\nSimply use the “Volume” and “Personal KD%” drop-downs to filter the list to your needs.\n\nKeep in mind that your SEO strategy shouldn’t rely solely on commercial and transactional keywords.\n\nIt’s also important to educate your audience by creating content targeting informational keywords.\n\nThese keywords act as a gateway to drive more people onto your website.\n\nIn most cases, people searching for informational keywords aren’t quite ready to buy.\n\nHere, your goal is to get them to learn about your brand so they remember you once they’re ready to make a purchase.\n\nOr capture their contact information (such as their email address) to nurture them into becoming customers.\n\nTo find informational keywords, simply use the “Intent” drop-down filter in the Keyword Magic Tool and select the “Informational” option like we showed above.\n\nOnce you’re happy with your keyword list, export it to a CSV or Excel file by clicking the “Export” button. \n\nOr add them to custom keyword lists to access them later in the Keyword Strategy Builder. \n\nJust tick the box next to the keywords you want to add and click “+ Add to keyword list.” Then select a list from the box that appears, or create one with the “Create new empty list” button.\n\nWith this list, you can start creating content for keywords that have the potential to drive high-quality traffic to your website.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Perform a Keyword Gap Analysis\n\nA keyword gap analysis involves comparing multiple competing domains to find keywords they’re ranking for but your website isn’t.\n\nIn other words: missed opportunities.\n\nHere’s how to do it using Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool:\n\nEnter your domain and up to four competing domains. Then, click the “Compare” button.\n\nThe tool will then analyze the domains and generate a report.\n\nScroll down to the “All keyword details for:” section.\n\nHere, you’ll see a few different tabs. The most important one you’ll want to pay attention to is the “Untapped” tab.\n\nHere, you’ll be able to see a list of keywords one or more competing domains rank for but yours doesn’t. These keywords are likely good opportunities for you to target with your website.\n\nNarrow down this list by using the drop-down filters at the top. For example, use the “Advanced filters” drop-down to exclude branded keywords.\n\nYou can then export your list or add them to pre-existing keyword lists, like you did with the Keyword Magic Tool above. Then, start creating content to fill these keyword gaps.\n\n3. Make Sure Your Content Meets Search Intent\n\nIf you want your website content to rank, you need to make sure it meets the search intent (the reason users are typing in a particular search query). Your content should help searchers accomplish what they set out to do.\n\nThere are four main types of search intent:\n\nInformational: The user is looking for information on a specific topic (e.g., “how to fix a water leak”)\nNavigational: The user is trying to find a specific page or website (e.g., “reddit login”)\nCommercial: The user is researching a product or service (e.g., “best espresso machine for beginners”)\nTransactional: The user is ready to buy a product or service (e.g., “buy amazon gift card”)\n\nFind a keyword’s intent by running it through the Keyword Overview tool:\n\nOnce you understand the search intent behind a keyword, you can then create the appropriate content to meet that intent. \n\nFor an informational keyword, this might be an educational guide on the topic.\n\nFor commercial keywords, appropriate content might include product comparisons and roundups. Like this:\n\nAnd for transactional keywords, appropriate content would likely include product landing pages.\n\nKeep in mind that the above examples are just that—examples. They’re the most commonly used types of content for targeting these kinds of keywords.\n\nBut you should always analyze the pages in the top search results for your target keyword to understand what type of content will truly satisfy search intent.\n\nSince Google considers these pages the most relevant results for the keyword, they’re the most likely to help solve the searcher’s query.\n\nFor example, if you search for “small business tools” on Google, you’ll see that the top-ranking pages are all roundups of small business software. Rather than pages for specific tools.\n\nWhich means that, if you were to target this keyword, it would be wise to do it by creating an article listing various small business software. Rather than focusing only on your sales pages.\n\n4. Take a Unique Angle with Your Content\n\nWhile the top-ranking pages for a keyword can be helpful for figuring out what kind of content to create when targeting a specific keyword, you don’t want to copy exactly what other websites are doing.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, firstly, you won’t be adding anything new to the conversation. So why should Google rank your website at the top? And why should users trust you over everyone else? \n\nSecondly, if you’re doing what everyone else is doing, you’ll have no chance of standing out on the search results page. Which can make it harder to get clicks to your site.\n\nSo what can you do?\n\nOne of the best ways to stand out is to add a unique angle to your content.\n\nLet’s look at our previous example of the search results for “small business tools.” \n\nThe titles are all very similar, as are the article structures. How could you differentiate your article from the rest while still meeting the search intent?\n\nYou could survey 500 small business owners on their favorite tools and then create a list based on the results. And you could add that to your title, like “15 Top Small Business Tools According to 500 Business Owners.”\n\nThis would help your page stand out in the sea of generic roundups for that specific keyword.\n\n5. Make Your Content Easy to Read\n\nYou now know you need to create unique and interesting content that meets the search intent. But it won’t matter if no one ends up reading it because it’s just too hard to consume.\n\nHere’s how to make your content easier to read:\n\nUse Simple Language\n\nDepending on the subject, people of different ages and educational backgrounds might read your content. And native and non-native speakers alike might find your pages.\n\nSo you should use simple language that everyone can understand.\n\nAnd avoid complex expressions, flowery language, and jargon.\n\nNote\n\nSometimes, you will need to include technical terms. Especially if your target audience is familiar with the topic. But it’s always best to define them in simpler terms where possible.\n\nUse Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant to check how easy your content is to read. Simply click “Analyze my text” to get started.\n\nThen, paste your text (or import it from an existing URL), enter your target keyword, and click “Get recommendations” on the right-hand side of the screen.\n\nThe tool will then analyze your text and provide you with a number of suggestions for how to improve it. Scroll down to the “Readability” section in the right-hand menu and click on it.\n\nHere, you’ll be able to see the readability score for your content and how it compares to the average score of the top 10 search results.\n\nIn general, you’ll want to aim for a score of 60 or higher. Which indicates that the content reads at an eighth or ninth grade level.\n\nIf you’re getting a score lower than 60, try simplifying the language further.\n\nA good exercise is to have a friend or family member who is unfamiliar with the subject matter read the text and tell you which parts they’re having a hard time with. Then, rework these parts so that they’re easier to understand.\n\nStick to Short Sentences and Paragraphs\n\nIt can be tough to follow and comprehend long sentences. Even if they do use simple language.\n\nUse short sentences where possible. It’s fine (and usually best) to vary sentence length. But most of your content should consist of simple, concise sentences.\n\nAnd you don’t want to pile your sentences into a long wall of text either. Stick to short paragraphs of 3-4 lines each.\n\nThis will make your content a lot easier on the eyes. Which means a greater chance that visitors will read the whole thing.\n\nUse the Right Font Size\n\nFont size plays a big part in content readability.\n\nYou’ll want to find a balance between the font size being too small to read comfortably. And being so big that it forces users to scroll too much when trying to read your content.\n\nGood starting points for choosing readable font sizes are:\n\nDesktop screens:18px-24px\nMobile screens: 16px-20px\n\nBut feel free to experiment to find the right font size for your website.\n\nStructure Your Content with Headings\n\nApart from providing structure to your content, headings also make it easier to scan, skim through, and navigate your content.\n\nYou should use headings in a hierarchical order.\n\nThe first heading on your page should be the H1 heading. Which should be followed by one or more H2 headings, under which you can nest H3s, H4s, and so on (down to H6).\n\nHeadings are also a good place to incorporate your keywords. For example, you should include your primary keyword in the H1 heading to make it easier for both search engines and users to understand what your content is about.\n\nYou can also include it in one or more of your H2 headings. And incorporate any secondary or related keywords in other headings.\n\nBut don’t overdo it. Only add keywords where it makes sense and sounds natural.\n\nUse Lists\n\nNumbered and bulleted lists help provide a visual break within your content.\n\nThey can also make it easier for you to make a point or explain specific concepts.\n\nAnd they can even help your content appear in Google’s featured snippets for some searches where a list makes sense. Like this:\n\nAdd Visuals\n\nSimilarly to lists, visuals (such as static images, GIF animations, and videos) help break up your content and make it more engaging.\n\nThey’re also useful for explaining and demonstrating complex concepts and processes.\n\nIdeally, you should aim to include a visual for every 300-500 words of text (although there’s no hard number to aim for).\n\nBut make sure to only include visuals that add value to the reader—don’t add them just for the sake of adding them.\n\n6. Demonstrate E-E-A-T\n\nE-E-A-T is a set of criteria used by Google’s Search Quality Raters to evaluate the performance of Google’s ranking systems. But you can also use these criteria to self-evaluate your content.\n\nE-E-A-T stands for:\n\nExperience: Is the author of the content experienced with the topic?\nExpertise: Do they have expertise on the topic?\nAuthoritativeness: Are they an authority on the topic?\nTrustworthiness: Are they (the author and the website) trustworthy?\n\nIf you find that your content or website is lacking in any of the four criteria, use these tips to improve it:\n\nIncorporate Personal Experiences Into Your Content\n\nShowing that you have personal experience with the topic can make your advice more credible. And make the content itself a lot more engaging.\n\nFor example, let’s say you’re reading an article about the top restaurants in your city. Consider which of these you would trust more:\n\nA generic article providing a basic description of each restaurant and the types of meals available\nA detailed article with images, where the author describes their personal experience with each restaurant and shares their subjective opinion and rating for each venue\n\nYou would probably say article No. 2. Because it displays proof the author was there (through images). And detailed descriptions that go beyond what someone could learn by simply reading about the restaurant online.\n\nSo, strive to incorporate your personal experiences and your unique point of view into your content as much as possible.\n\nDisplay Your Expertise\n\nWhat makes you the right person to write about a specific topic? Why should someone trust your advice?\n\nIt’s important that you include this information to help both Google and readers understand why you’re an expert on the topic.\n\nA good way to do this is to write a detailed author bio that includes relevant information. Like your job title, any relevant degrees, and how much experience you have with the topic.\n\nHere’s an example from an article about retirement:\n\nIt makes clear to both readers and search engines that the author is qualified to talk about this topic. And it includes a “Read more” link where you can find out more on the author’s page.\n\nBuild Authority\n\nYou can build your authority by covering a subject matter comprehensively.\n\nFor example, if you want your website to become known as an authority on coffee, you’ll need to cover a variety of different coffee-related topics. Such as:\n\nThe history of coffee\nTypes of coffee\nCoffee preparation methods\nCoffee equipment\n\nAnd more.\n\nThis can help signal that your website is relevant for coffee-related searches. \n\nIncorporating personal experiences into your content, showcasing your expertise, and building authority can make your website appear more trustworthy. Helping you satisfy the fourth element of E-E-A-T (trustworthiness).\n\n7. Optimize Your Content for Featured Snippets\n\nFeatured snippets are excerpts of text from pages that are sometimes displayed at the top of the search results. Usually answering a question.\n\nSince the featured snippet is the first thing a user sees on the search results page, this type of result tends to get a lot of clicks. But they don’t display for all searches.\n\nFind Keywords That Trigger Featured Snippets\n\nUse Semrush’s Organic Research tool to find relevant keywords that trigger featured snippets in Google’s search results. And you can do it for terms you already rank for (which are therefore great opportunities to optimize for the snippet).\n\nHere’s how:\n\nStart by typing in your domain. Then, click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see information about the keywords you rank for, traffic, and more. Navigate to the “Positions” tab.\n\nHere, you’ll be able to see all the keywords the domain ranks for. \n\nUse the “SERP Features” drop-down filter to select “Domain doesn’t rank” > “Featured snippet.” \n\nThis will filter the list to only show keywords you already rank for that trigger featured snippets you don’t currently have. \n\nTip\n\nYou can perform this same workflow for competitor domains (as they are likely targeting similar keywords).\n\nNext, it’s time to optimize your content to grab those snippets.\n\nOptimize Your Content for Featured Snippets\n\nWhen looking to increase your chances of ranking for a featured snippet, start by examining the format of the existing snippet. If the existing snippet is a straightforward answer to a question, your best chance is to also answer that question within your content.\n\nOn the other hand, if the featured snippet is a list, you can try adding a relevant list to your content.\n\nText-based snippets are usually short. So you’ll want to keep the section you’re trying to rank to around 200-300 characters.\n\nAnd add the most important information at the very start of the snippet (such as under the relevant heading). To help searchers find the information they’re looking for as quickly as possible.\n\n8. Use Short, Descriptive URLs\n\nUsing short, descriptive URLs helps users understand what a page is about at a glance. \n\nShort, descriptive URLs also look better on search results pages and can make users feel more confident about visiting your page.\n\nFor example, compare this URL:\n\nhttps://example.com/seo-best-practices\n\nWith this one:\n\nhttps://example.com/seo-24682496.html\n\nThe first one is a lot more descriptive, right?\n\nSo, try to make your page URLs fairly short and indicative of what the page is about. Ideally, make your primary keyword the URL slug (the last part of the URL). \n\nFor example, if your target keyword was “dog training tips,” your page URL might be “https://example.com/blog/dog-training-tips/”\n\nBonus tip: Avoid using dates or years in page URLs.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you’re likely going to update the page at some point. And then the date you included in the URL will no longer be relevant.\n\nTo update the URL and change the date, you’ll need to set up a redirect from the old URL to the new one. And if you don’t do it right, you’ll end up with broken links on your website. And potential lost rankings.\n\nPrevent this issue from the start by excluding dates from your URLs altogether.\n\n9. Make Your Website Blazing Fast\n\nPage speed has been a ranking factor for both desktop and mobile searches for years now.\n\nIt’s easy to understand why—websites that load fast provide a better user experience. Which is a priority for Google.\n\nFollow these tips to make your website as fast as possible:\n\nUse a CDN\n\nA content delivery network (CDN) stores your website content on multiple servers around the world. When a user visits your website, your content is loaded from the server that’s physically closest to the user’s location.\n\nThis can result in a significant increase in page load speed.\n\nThere are plenty of CDN providers you can choose from. A couple of popular ones include Cloudflare and Akamai.\n\nMinify JavaScript and CSS Files\n\nYou can reduce the size of your JavaScript and CSS files (and help them load faster) by removing unnecessary data. Such as comments and line breaks.\n\nThis process is called minification.\n\nYou can use tools like Minifier or Toptal JavaScript Minifier & Compressor to minify your JavaScript and CSS files.\n\nLimit Third-Party Scripts\n\nLoading third-party scripts involves making requests to servers outside of the one that hosts your website.\n\nAnd depending on the number and complexity of the third-party scripts you use, it can significantly slow down your website.\n\nCheck your site for any unnecessary external scripts that you might have running. For example, maybe you have a script from an A/B testing tool on your website. But you no longer run A/B tests.\n\nOpt for Dedicated Web Hosting\n\nWith dedicated web hosting, your website is hosted on a dedicated server that isn’t shared with other websites.\n\nThe advantage of using this type of hosting is that there’s no risk of your website slowing down due to other websites on the server using more resources than usual.\n\nWhile more expensive than shared hosting, using dedicated hosting can result in significantly improved performance for your website. And this, in turn, can lead to a better user experience on your website. Which can lead to better rankings and more traffic.\n\nNote\n\nIt can be quite a price jump to move to dedicated hosting. And it doesn’t always lead to major improvements in page speed or search performance.\n\nCompress Your Images\n\nImages, especially high-definition ones, can take a while to load. And if you have a lot of them on your website, this can result in very slow page load speeds.\n\nAddress this by using compression to reduce the size of your images.\n\nThere are a number of online platforms you can use to compress your images without any significant reduction in quality. Such as Kraken and Optimizilla.\n\nOptimize Your Fonts\n\nIn order to display text, your website first needs to load the fonts used on the page.\n\nIf your website uses a lot of different fonts or if the fonts you use have large file sizes, this can have a negative impact on page load speed.\n\nOne way to address this is to only use system fonts. These are the default fonts on the user’s device. \n\nAlternatively, you can try to use fewer fonts on your website. But this might make your website look a bit bland. \n\nSo you need to weigh the performance benefits with how it affects other aspects of the user experience.\n\n10. Use Internal Links Strategically\n\nYou’re likely already (or should already be) using internal links. These are links pointing to different pages on your website. \n\nInternal links can help users navigate your website more easily. And allow search engines to get a better understanding of your website and its content.\n\nBut you need a strategy for using internal links.\n\nFocus your internal linking on the most important pages on your website. These are the pages you’d like users and search engines to pay attention to the most.\n\nDepending on your business, this will likely be your product or service pages. You should link both to and from these pages.\n\nIt’s also important that you use descriptive anchor text (the clickable part of a link) that hints at what the linked page is about.\n\nFor example, using the anchor text “list of best in-ear headphones” to link to a roundup article about in-ear headphones. Avoid using generic anchor text (such as “click here”).\n\nAlso, make sure to add internal links only where they’re relevant and helpful to users—don’t force them in just to have more internal links on a page.\n\n11. Avoid Orphan Pages\n\nOrphan pages are pages that don’t have any internal links pointing to them. Having pages like this on your website can be an issue for a couple of reasons.\n\nSince no other page is linking to them, it’s possible that Google won’t discover and index them.\n\nAnd since you’re not linking to them and Google isn’t indexing them, it’s going to be tough for users to discover them, too.\n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to uncover orphan pages on your website.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nType in your domain and click “Start Audit.”\n\nYou’ll then create a project, where you can customize a number of settings for the audit. Like how many URLs to crawl. But you can also just move forward with the default settings and click the “Start Site Audit” button.\n\nAfter analyzing your website, the tool will present you with a detailed report. Navigate to the “Issues” tab.\n\nType in “orphan” into the search box. The tool will then show you if your website has any orphan pages. Click the linked part (with the number) to see a list of your orphan pages.\n\nOnce you have a list of orphan pages, look for opportunities to link to them from other (relevant) pages on your website.\n\n12. Fix Broken Links\n\nBroken links are links that lead to pages that don’t exist anymore.\n\nThe two most common ways you end up with broken links include:\n\nDeleting a page but not removing the links that point to it\nChanging a page’s URL without setting up a proper redirect\n\nHaving a lot of broken links on your website can frustrate users and result in a poor page experience.\n\nAnd since page experience has an impact on how Google ranks websites in search results, you want to ensure that your website doesn’t have any broken links.\n\nCheck your website for broken links with the Site Audit tool. Simply visit the “Issues” tab again and type in “broken” in the search box.\n\nThe tool will then show you if your website has any broken links. To see a list of pages containing broken links, click the linked part of the issue.\n\nNow go ahead and remove these links from your website. Or replace them with more relevant (and up-to-date) URLs.\n\nFind and Fix Broken Links\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n13. Update Your Content Regularly\n\nKeeping your content up to date ensures it’s always relevant and helpful to your audience. Follow these tips to update your content:\n\nCheck Facts and Sources\n\nGo through your content and make sure the information is accurate. And that you’re properly citing your sources.\n\nIf you’re citing studies or statistics, always include a link to the primary source. Not necessarily the first resource you find that’s actually quoting another resource.\n\nReview Links\n\nCheck all internal and external links within your content and make sure they still work and point to live pages.\n\nLook at every link critically and make sure it’s genuinely helpful to your audience. Rather than just including irrelevant internal links over target keywords. \n\nReplace Outdated Images\n\nEnsure any images or graphics contain up-to-date information. This helps boost your credibility and ensures you’re not misleading your site’s visitors.\n\nAlso make sure to update any images of your business’s location after a move. To avoid confusing potential customers.\n\nAnd if the way your products look has changed, you should replace any outdated images. To ensure they reflect what you currently offer.\n\nAdd Missing Information\n\nTake one more look at the content—does it contain all the information a reader might need to address the problem they’re looking to solve? In other words, are you fully meeting the search intent?\n\nIf there’s something missing, add the missing information to your content. You don’t want readers leaving your website and going back to Google to fill in the blanks.\n\n14. Create Topic Clusters\n\nTopic clusters are a way to organize your content and build topical authority by covering topics extensively.\n\nEach topic cluster should have one pillar page—a page that covers a single topic comprehensively. And each pillar page should be supported by cluster pages. These are smaller pages that each cover a subtopic.\n\nAnd these pages should generally all link to each other where relevant.\n\nLike this:\n\nAs you can see, once you complete a topic cluster, you should have covered everything a person might want to know about a given topic. This, in turn, helps show both Google and users that your website is an authority on the topic.\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder to plan out your topic clusters with ease. Here’s how:\n\nStart by entering up to five seed keywords, then click “Create list.” Alternatively, choose one of the lists you created earlier. \n\nThe tool will then generate a list of relevant pillar and cluster page ideas for you.\n\nFilter the suggestions by search volume, keyword difficulty, or intent. \n\nFor example, if you want to focus on commercial keywords, click the “Intent” filter. Then select “Commercial” from the drop-down and click “Apply.”\n\nAnd select the pillar and cluster pages you’d like to include in your strategy.\n\nOnce you’re happy with your selection, export the list by clicking the “Export” button.\n\nThe next step is to create high-quality content for both the pillar and cluster pages.\n\n15. Get High-Quality Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are links pointing from one website to another. And they’re crucial for building your website’s authority.\n\nYou can think of them as votes of confidence for your website. The more frequently other reputable websites link to yours, the more trustworthy your website may seem to search engines.\n\nHere are three ways to build high-quality backlinks to your website:\n\nSteal Competitors’ Backlinks\n\nWebsites linking to your competitors are probably relevant to your industry and audience. \n\nAnd since they’re already linking to your competition, they may be open to linking to your website too.\n\nTake advantage of this by analyzing your competitors’ backlink profiles and getting a list of domains that link to them. Then, include these domains in your link building outreach campaigns.\n\nUse the Backlink Gap tool to compare backlink profiles of multiple competing domains against each other. And then find websites that link to one or more competing domains (but not yours).\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nEnter your domain and up to four competing domains. Click “Find prospects.”\n\nThe tool will then generate a list of domains that link to your competitors. Here, you’ll want to pay attention to the “Best” tab—it shows websites that link to all competing domains but don’t link to your website.\n\nClicking the numbers under a competitor will show you more details about the links to that site.\n\nLike the link source, the anchor text, and the target URL. \n\nUse this information to understand what kind of content on your competitors’ sites gets links. And where from.\n\nFind Backlink Opportunities\n\nwith the Backlink Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nFind Unlinked Mentions\n\nDomains that mention your brand in their content but don’t include a link to your website are a great link building opportunity.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause these websites are already familiar with your brand and are referencing it throughout their content. Meaning they’re more likely to give you a backlink if you ask for it.\n\nHere’s how to find unlinked mentions using the Brand Monitoring app:\n\nClick the “Get started” button on the app page.\n\nChoose the “Brand” option.\n\nAdd your brand name.\n\nIn the “Sources” section, select the types of sources you’d like to track for brand mentions. “News” and “Blogs” are likely to be the most relevant options for you here.\n\nClick the “Create Query” button.\n\nThe tool will then find mentions of your brand online. And present them as a list that looks like this:\n\nFilter the mentions by date by using the “Date range” drop-down filter.\n\nOr use the “Outlet domain” drop-down to filter by Rank, Name, and Authority.\n\nOnce you’re happy with the list, reach out to these websites and ask them to give you a link.\n\nFor more specific tips on how to do that, check out our guide to link building outreach.\n\nAttract Links Naturally\n\nApart from asking for links, you can also attract them organically by creating valuable resources that have a high chance of being shared and linked to (also known as link bait).\n\nDepending on your audience and their needs, this could be a free tool, a study report, a statistics roundup, a template, or even an infographic.\n\nTake this Semrush study, for example. It analyzed 28,000 domains to find out how long it takes, on average, to rank on the first page of Google’s search results. And revealed a number of interesting insights.\n\nAs a result, the study was shared extensively in the SEO community, and managed to generate 1.4K backlinks from 200+ referring domains.\n\nBut you don’t need to do a study to attract backlinks to your website. Get creative and try to figure out what kind of resource might become popular among your target audience.\n\nIdeally, it should be:\n\nA unique resource that isn’t already out there \nSomething your audience will find valuable\nFull of actionable insights and advice your audience can implement to address a pain point or solve a problem\nPut These SEO Tips Into Action\n\nIt’s impossible to cover every aspect of SEO in one guide.
