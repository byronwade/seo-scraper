  "content": "What Is a Competitive Analysis?\n\nA competitive analysis is the process of gathering data about the products, sales, and marketing strategies of your competitors (i.e., other businesses in the same industry). Businesses use that data to identify their strengths and weaknesses and discover potential opportunities. \n\nA competitor analysis can help you understand the market landscape and make informed decisions to improve your position in the industry. \n\nDepending on your business, you can analyze competitors in many ways. But we’ll cover the basic steps you need to know.\n\nPro Tip\n\nGenerate a competitive analysis snapshot in a few clicks with Semrush’s Market Explorer. Get competitor data, like:\n\nMarket Share by Channel\nTraffic Sources\nOrganic Traffic\nWhy Competitive Analyses Are Important\n\nCompetitive analyses are essential for any business that wants to succeed in a crowded and competitive market.\n\nRegularly conducting competitive analyses can help you:\n\nUnderstand your market and industry\nCompare your results with your competitors’ performance\nIdentify gaps in your strategy that your competitors address\nDevelop strategies and tactics that promote your unique value proposition\nStay on top of market changes to gain a competitive edge over your competitors\n\nRead on to find out how you can get started.\n\nWhat to Include in a Competitive Analysis\n\nThe factors you include in your competitor analysis depend largely on your goals and industry.\n\nFor example, an online pet store owner will want to see what products their competitors sell that they don’t. A SaaS company, on the other hand, will probably want to look into their competitors’ features and pricing pages.\n\nTo get you started, here are seven factors that stay the same across the board:\n\nFeatures or Products\n\nCompare your features or products to your competitors’ and highlight those that make you stand out or fall behind.\n\nFor example, if you’re selling an email marketing tool, you might want to compare features such as:\n\nTemplates\nSegmentation\nAutomation\nSupport\nIntegrations\n\nThat way, you get a clearer picture of what your competitors are doing differently and why.\n\nPricing\n\nPricing is the amount of money you charge for your product or service.\n\nUse your competitors’ pricing strategy to guide your own. And make sure you’re not over- or under-charging your customers. \n\nSuppose you run an online course platform. You might want to compare pricing factors such as:\n\nPricing model (e.g., subscription, one-time, freemium)\nPricing tiers (e.g., basic, premium, enterprise)\nPricing options (e.g., monthly, annual, lifetime)\nPricing discounts (e.g., coupons, bundles, referrals)\nPricing value (e.g., features, quality, reputation)\nTarget Audience\n\nTarget audience is the group of people you’d like to reach and serve with your product or service.\n\nWhen conducting a competitive analysis in marketing, try to discern who your competitors are targeting. \n\nHow does it differ from your target audience? What are their needs, preferences, behaviors, and pain points? Are they targeting someone you aren’t? How can you better serve them?\n\nFor example, if you run a fitness app, you might want to compare target audience characteristics such as:\n\nDemographics (e.g., age, gender, location)\nPsychographics (e.g., interests, values, goals)\nBehaviors (e.g., habits, preferences, pain points)\nNeeds (e.g., problems, solutions, benefits)\nMarketing\n\nMarketing is the process of promoting and selling your product or service to your target audience. \n\nLook at your competitors’ marketing strategies to identify how you can improve your own. And increase your awareness, visibility, and conversions.\n\nFor example, if you own a travel booking website, you might want to compare marketing channels such as:\n\nWebsite (e.g., design, content, SEO)\nSocial media (e.g., platforms, posts, engagement)\nEmail (e.g., newsletters, campaigns, open rates)\nAdvertising (e.g., platforms, ads, clicks)\nPR (e.g., media coverage, press releases, reviews)\nDifferentiators\n\nDifferentiators are the factors that make your product or service unique and superior.\n\nIdentify what that means for you.\n\nLook at how your customers position themselves to find out what sets you apart. And how your product or service is better.\n\nThen, communicate those differentiators to your customers. \n\nFor example, if you sell a vegan meal delivery service, you might want to highlight differentiators such as:\n\nQuality (e.g., organic ingredients, fresh delivery)\nVariety (e.g., cuisines, dishes, flavors)\nConvenience (e.g., easy ordering, flexible plans)\nSustainability (e.g., eco-friendly packaging, carbon offsetting)\nSocial impact (e.g., donations, partnerships)\nStrengths\n\nStrengths are the aspects of your product or service that give you an advantage over your competitors. \n\nList and analyze your strengths in your competition analysis. So that you know what you can double down on.\n\nFor example, if you run a cloud storage service, you might identify strengths such as:\n\nSecurity (e.g., encryption, backup)\nSpeed (e.g., upload, download)\nStorage (e.g., space, files)\nCollaboration (e.g., sharing, editing)\nInnovation (e.g., features, updates)\nWeaknesses\n\nWeaknesses are the aspects of your product or service that put you at a disadvantage compared to your competitors. \n\nList these out as well. Acknowledge them. Analyze how they affect your performance and results. \n\nAnd then work on improving them.\n\nFor example, if you are selling a video streaming platform, you might want identify weaknesses such as:\n\nContent (e.g., quantity, quality, exclusivity)\nPricing (e.g., cost, value, affordability)\nUser experience (e.g., interface, navigation, personalization)\nCustomer service (e.g., support, feedback, retention)\nCompetition (e.g., rivals, threats, substitutes)\nHow to Do a Competitive Analysis\n\nBefore you start this walkthrough, grab a copy of Semrush’s Competitive Analysis Template to follow along.\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\nPerform a competitor analysis with these seven steps.\n\nPro Tip\n\nCreate a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along with the steps in this guide.\n\n1. Identify Your Competitors\n\nFirst, build a list of key competitors to watch out for.\n\nThis lets you see who might be competing for your audience’s attention. And gives you an idea of who to focus on throughout your competitor analysis.\n\nWe’ll walk you through how to find your competitors in these four key areas:\n\nYour industry\nOrganic search \nPaid search\nYour community\n\nSo that you can enter your data into your competitive analysis document. Like this:\n\nFind Your Industry Competitors\n\nYour industry competitors sell similar products or services to yours.\n\nFocus primarily on direct competitors, though. Meaning brands that fill a similar gap within your niche.\n\nAn example of direct competitors is Abercrombie & Fitch and Aritzia. \n\nBoth fashion brands focus on trendy women’s clothing—popular with Generation Z and younger millennials. They occupy the same position in the market.\n\nAn indirect competitor would be Animal Crossing and Mortal Kombat. They’re both video games, but their audiences are vastly different.\n\nYou should also consider your business’s size and competition level. \n\nFor example, a local Toyota dealership may rank for similar keywords as the overarching Toyota brand.\n\nThis doesn’t mean they will directly compete. \n\nThe local dealership’s competition would be other local dealerships instead. Keep context in mind as you use competitor analysis tools.\n\nHere are a few ways to identify direct competitors:\n\nMarket research: Study the market to find companies selling similar products that fulfill the same purpose. Talk to your sales team to find out which companies often come up in their sales process.\nCustomer feedback: Once customers decide on your product, ask them what other products they were considering. This will help you identify closely related companies.\nSocial media and online communities: Many people seek recommendations on social media or forums like Reddit and Quora. Investigate customer conversations on these sites to find potential competitors.\n\nFor a general view of your digital competitors in your industry, use a competitor analysis tool like Market Explorer.\n\nFirst, select “Find Competitors” and enter your domain. \n\nThis will automatically generate a list of the major players in your space.\n\nThe “Overview” tab will show you who you compete with online. It will also visualize their relative market share, audience size, and growth rate.\n\nNow, scroll to the “Growth Quadrant” widget.\n\nThe Growth Quadrant chart breaks down you and your competitors into four basic categories: \n\nNiche Players: New or small companies with smaller audience size and a low growth rate\nGame Changers: Emerging companies with a comparatively smaller audience size that are growing quickly\nEstablished Players: Companies with large, established audiences\nLeaders: Companies with both a large audience and a rapid growth rate\n\nNote where each competitor stands. And how their audience and traffic growth compare to yours. \n\nWhich players occupy the same quadrant as you? Which should you be most concerned about?\n\nOnce you’ve identified key competitors in your industry, research their online presence through organic, paid, and local searches.\n\nIdentify Your Competitors\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nFind Your Organic Competitors\n\nNext, identify your competitors in organic search. These are brands that target the same SEO keywords as you.\n\nThese can differ from industry competitors. They may not have the same type of business you do. But they still compete with you in Google’s search results.\n\nYou can easily find organic competitors with the “Competitors” report in Semrush’s Organic Research tool.\n\nStart by entering your domain and clicking “Search.”\n\nThen, click on the “Competitors” tab.\n\nYou’ll see a list of organic competitors sorted by Competition Level. \n\nThis metric is based on the number of keywords a competitor ranks for. And the number of keywords you and the competitor share. \n\nLike so:\n\nNote your biggest organic search competitors and any new names that did not appear in Market Explorer.\n\nPro Tip\n\nHead to the “Position Changes” tab to see the specific keywords your top organic competitors have been ranking for and monitor how their rankings shift over time to identify keyword opportunities. \n\nFind Your Paid Search Competitors\n\nNext, look for your paid search competitors. These are businesses that show up for the paid keywords you’re targeting.\n\nAds that show up for users depend on many factors, including location, device, and context of the search term.\n\nA tool like Advertising Research can help you identify who your paid competitors are. And how their paid ads perform.\n\nTo get started, enter your domain and hit “Search.”\n\nNext, head to the “Competitors” tab.\n\nScroll and you’ll see a list of paid search competitors, sorted by competition level:\n\nYou can also see how many paid keywords you have in common, how much paid traffic your competitors’ ads drive, and how many paid keywords your competitors rank for.\n\nFind Your Local SEO Competitors\n\nIf you run a business with a physical storefront, you must identify your local competitors—both online and offline.\n\nThese are competitors who offer a similar product or service (filling the same market gap) within your geographic area. \n\nTo do that, track important local keywords and compare your business’s proximity with other sites that rank for those keywords.\n\nAnd you’ll want to make sure your website ranks prominently on Google for location-specific keywords. \n\nThat means optimizing your site for local SEO so you’ll appear in local search results. \n\nLike so:\n\nYou can start your competitor research by using the Keyword Overview tool. To see what the SERP (search engine results page) looks like for keywords like “pizza near me.”\n\nThe top-ranking domains are your local SEO competitors.\n\nTo then track important local keywords and competitors, use the Position Tracking tool.\n\nEnter your domain in the Position Tracking tool. And, click “Set up tracking.”\n\nSet a local target (e.g., the city or state where your company operates).\n\nOn the next page, you can add the keywords you’d like to track and click “Add keywords to campaign.”\n\nNow, you’re ready to “Start Tracking.”\n\nOnce your campaign is ready, visit the “Competitors Discovery” tab to find local competitors.\n\nYou’ll get a list of competitors sorted by “Visibility.”\n\nVisibility is based on click-through rate (CTR) and shows a website’s progress in Google’s top 100 ranked webpages for keywords in the current tracking campaign.\n\nTake note of competitors who are dominating the local conversation. \n\nThen, ensure your website is optimized for local search with up-to-date address and contact information across all your platforms (especially your Google Business Profile). \n\nFurther reading:\n\nLocal Keyword Research for SEO: What It Is & How to Do It\nGoogle My Business: A Guide to Google Business Profile\n2. Create Competitor Profiles\n\nBuilding a profile for each of your main competitors allows you to benchmark important details, including market share and audience demographics.\n\nHere’s what that’ll look like in your competitive analysis document:\n\nLet’s begin by analyzing market share, or the influence a brand has within their industry.\n\nAnalyzing Market Share\n\nMarket share is a percentage of a company’s sales or revenue out of the total sales or revenue for its industry.\n\nPublicly traded companies are required to state their earnings every quarter.Many private companies are, too. \n\nSo, you can get a lot of information by searching “[company name] quarterly report” or “[company name] annual report” in Google.\n\nYou can also consider estimations from trusted business publications.\n\nFor example, Yahoo Finance reports on a lot of this information for public companies.\n\nHere’s some of the market share information for Apple:\n\nTo calculate market share, divide the total company revenue by total industry sales.\n\nLike this:\n\nSelect a fiscal period (usually quarterly or annual)\nCalculate a company’s total sales for that period\nCalculate the industry’s total sales for that period\nDivide the company’s revenue by industry sales\nMultiply that number by 100 to find the market share percentage\n\nHere’s a real-world example: \n\nToyota sold 2,332,262 vehicles in the U.S. in 2021.\n\nAnd 15 million total vehicles were sold in the U.S. during the same period.\n\nIf we divide Toyota’s total sales (2,332,262) by the industry’s total sales (15,000,000), we get 0.155.\n\nMultiply that by 100, and we get 15.5%. Which is Toyota’s market share for 2021.\n\nWe recommend completing this step for your main direct competitors. It’ll help you benchmark your success within your industry.\n\nUnderstanding Audience Demographics\n\nMarket share shows you which competitor has the biggest influence over your audience. But it doesn’t tell you who that audience is. \n\nUnderstanding audience demographics can help you connect with customers and create products and services that address their needs.\n\nYou can use a tool like Market Explorer to analyze any website’s audience demographics. \n\nEnter a competitor’s URL and head to the “Audience” tab.\n\nThis report provides a high-level overview of the audience demographics in your niche, including:\n\nAge and sex\nSocial media preferences\nAudience interests\n\nNext, find out how your audience compares to and overlaps with your closest competitors. \n\nYou can do this with Traffic Analytics.\n\nSelect “Check Competitors.” \n\nThen, enter your domain and up to four competitor domains into the search bar, and click “Analyze.” \n\nNow, head to the “Audience Overview” tab. \n\nYou’ll see a side-by-side comparison of each domain’s audience. And how much they overlap. \n\nBuilding Your Competitor Profiles \n\nIt’s time to round out your competitor profiles by filling in basic company information. \n\nThis provides context that could help you analyze your findings. And build a more competitive marketing strategy.\n\nFor example, one of your competitors may have only been around for a few years. But if they’ve raised millions in funding rounds, they may be a bigger threat to you than a larger, more established competitor.\n\nYou can find basic information about your competitors in the “Company Info” section of the Traffic Analytics “Overview” report. \n\nJust scroll down and you’ll see the widget. \n\nYou can see which categories your competitors operate in, their funding amount, and roughly how many employees they have.\n\nFurther reading: How to Use Website Demographics to Improve Your Marketing Strategy\n\n3. Analyze Your Competitors' Product, Pricing, Place, and Promotional Strategies\n\nOnce you have all the preliminary insights, it’s time to explore “the four Ps” of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion. \n\nLet’s break it down:\n\nProduct: How the product meets customers’ needs\nPricing: How much their product or service costs\nPlace: Where customers are looking for the product\nPromotion: How they advertise to their customers\n\nAdd that information to your competitive analysis document so that you can access and analyze the data easier:\n\nAnalyzing this information about your competitors will give you a deeper understanding of their marketing strategies.\n\nYou can replicate what’s already working in a better way. And avoid making the same mistakes. \n\nProduct\n\nBegin by visiting each competitor’s site and asking yourself:\n\nWhat’s their most popular product or service?\nWhat features does the product offer?\nWho’s the target audience for this product?\nWhat problem does this product solve?\n\nTake notes on your findings.\n\nYour competitors’ websites will give you insights into which products they prioritize. And which products they heavily promote or prominently display in their navigational menus.\n\nSteve Madden, for example, heavily prioritizes women’s apparel and accessories. \n\nThey have several main navigation drop-downs for these topics: ”Women’s Shoes,” “Women’s Clothing,” “Handbags,” and “Accessories.”\n\nLike this:\n\nIf we scroll further, we can also see that they are promoting what is probably a popular product right on the homepage:\n\nThis is why manual investigation is important—you can get clear insights into what your competitor prioritizes just by navigating their site.\n\nPrice\n\nOnce you’ve identified popular products, pay attention to pricing.\n\nHere are some things to note in your competitor analysis:\n\nHow does your competitor’s product pricing line up against comparable products?\nDo they have frequent sales, discounts, or other special offers?\n\nOf course, you need to make a profit. But if you notice that your competitors price similar products lower or constantly offer discounts, you may need to change your pricing strategy.\n\nPlace\n\nThe third P refers to where your product or service is available. This can be a physical storefront, an online store, or both.\n\nIf you place your product somewhere—in person or online—where your target audience doesn’t shop, you probably won’t see great results.\n\nTo start, here are a couple of questions to consider:\n\nWhere does your target audience shop?\nWhat distribution channels should you use to reach your audience?\n\nHere’s an example of “place” in action:\n\nCelebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta is known for his famous clients and luxury makeup line. \n\nSo, it makes more sense that he sells his products in Sephora stores rather than affordable retail chains like Walmart or CVS.\n\nPlace also applies to where you market your product.\n\nSay your company offers financial planning services. Your core audience probably skews a little older. \n\nSo, it wouldn’t make much sense to market your services on Snapchat, which has a notoriously young audience without as much buying power.\n\nPromotion\n\nPromotion is all about where your competitors market their products or services. This includes both advertising channels and brand messaging.\n\nHere are a couple of things to consider when researching your competitors’ promotion strategies:\n\nWhich of your competitor’s promotional channels drive the most traffic? (This could include direct, referral, paid, organic, or social.)\nWhat is their advertising strategy?\n\nTo get an idea of how your competitors generate their traffic, head to the “Benchmarking” report in Market Explorer. \n\nYou’ll see a breakdown of their traffic generation and social media distribution. And can compare up to five competitors at once. \n\nLike this:\n\nHere are a few conclusions you may draw from competitors’ best-performing channels:\n\nDirect: Direct traffic is when users navigate to a website directly, without the push of ads or links. So your competitor likely has strong brand awareness\nReferral: Referral traffic is when users arrive on a website through another source, like a link on another domain. So your competitor probably has a strong backlink profile, places banner ads on other sites, or has a strong digital PR presence\nSearch: Search is traffic from organic search, which means your competitor prioritizes SEO and content. You can analyze their content marketing and identify their top pages.\nSocial: Your competitor likely has a solid social media presence with an engaged audience. Investigate which platforms they use most.\nPaid: Your competitor probably has a strong advertising budget, particularly for paid search. Investigate which keywords they’re bidding on and analyze their ad copy with our Advertising Research tool.\n\nAnalyze Your Competitors\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Evaluate Competitor Marketing Strategies\n\nOne of the best ways to understand a competitor’s marketing efforts is to browse their website. It’s manual work, but it’s well worth the effort.\n\nPay attention to any of the following elements:\n\nDo they run a blog?\nDo they produce whitepapers or ebooks?\nDo they share videos or webinars?\nDo they host a podcast?\nDo they use static visual content like infographics and cartoons?\nHow about case studies?\nDo they have an FAQs section?\nDo they showcase featured articles?\nDo you notice press releases?\nDo they have a media kit?\nDo they publish buying guides and data sheets?\nHow much are they investing in PPC?\nWhat online and offline advertising campaigns are they using?\n\nTake note of what your competitors are doing and what you aren’t.\n\nSee what’s missing from your site and incorporate relevant missing elements into your own strategy. \n\nYou should also look into your competitors’ paid marketing strategies.\n\nAnd you can easily do that with a tool like Advertising Research. \n\nEnter a competitor’s domain and click “Analyze.” \n\nYou’ll see a dashboard with a summary of their ad campaigns, including:\n\nThe number of keywords bringing in traffic from paid search\nThe estimated monthly traffic from paid search\nThe estimated average monthly cost to rank for those keywords in Google Ads\n\nScroll down and you’ll get a list of keywords your competitor is bidding for in Google Ads. \n\nPlus, you’ll see:\n\nThe position they’re ranking for\nThe average CPC for each keyword\nThe exact URL they’re targeting with each keyword\n\nLike so:\n\nIf you want to dive a little deeper, click on the “Ads Copies” tab. \n\nYou’ll see the actual ad copy your competitor is running in Google Ads. And the keywords that trigger those ads. \n\nPro Tip\n\nUse AdClarity – Advertising Intelligence. To get specific data about your competitor’s advertising efforts.\n \n\nLike your competitors’ estimated expenditure, ad type distribution, ad buying methods, and ad spend trends.\n \n\nYou can also see their current top ads. To get inspiration for your own creative advertising campaigns.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhat Is Google Ads & How Does It Work? A Comprehensive Guide\nMarketing Strategy Guide: What It Is and How to Create One\n5. Analyze Marketing Channels\n\nOne of the most important aspects of competitive analysis is to understand how your competitors are reaching their target audience. \n\nIn other words, what marketing channels are they using? How effective are they? How can you leverage them for your own business?\n\nAnd these marketing channels can be divided into eight main categories:\n\nDirect: When a user enter the URL directly into a browser's search bar\nReferral: When a user visits from clicking a link on another website\nOrganic search: When a user visits from a search engine’s organic results\nPaid search: When a user visits from a search engine’s paid search ads\nOrganic social: When a user visits from clicking a link on social media\nPaid social: When a user visits from clicking an ad on social media\nEmail: When a user visits from clicking a link or banner in an email\nDisplay ads: When a user visits from clicking a display ad (banner, image, video, etc.) on another website\n\nYou can quickly analyze any competitor’s marketing channels with Market Explorer. \n\nJust enter their URL and scroll down to the “Domain vs Market Dynamics” widget. Click on each marketing channel to examine it more closely.\n\nLike this:\n\nTry to see how your main competitors’ marketing channels compare to yours. And record that data in your competitive analysis document.\n\nAnd determine whether you need to make any changes to say or get ahead.\n\nFurther reading: Effective Digital Marketing Channels & How to Use Them\n\nAnalyze Competitor Marketing Channels\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n6. Identify Your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & Threats\n\nAfter completing your competitor analysis, turn your observations into actionable insights by performing a SWOT analysis.\n\nSWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. \n\nA SWOT analysis looks like this—you’ll fill in each quadrant for your brand based on your competitive analysis findings:\n\nIf you fill out a SWOT analysis for both your brand and your competitors, you can compare the answers to the above questions to see where each brand excels.\n\nThis will help you identify where you’re doing well and where you can improve.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nSWOT Analysis: What It Is & How to Do It [Examples + Template]\nHow to Do a Competitive Landscape Analysis\n7. Track & Monitor Results\n\nOnce you have done your competitive analysis, you need to track and monitor results. This’ll help you measure your effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.\n\nThere are different ways to do this, depending on your goals and metrics. \n\nBut one of the most efficient is to set up a monthly competitor report. \n\nHead to My Reports, scroll through, and select “Monthly Competitor Analysis.”\n\nEnter your domain and two competitor domains. And click “Create report.”\n\nYou’ll quickly get a competitor analysis report.\n\nFirst is a summary of your domain’s current performance. \n\nThen, you’ll see how your domain compares to your competitors. \n\nLike so: \n\nThe great thing about the report is that it’s interactive. You can edit, add, or remove any widget you want. \n\nFor example, if you want to add more competitors to “Traffic Analytics Overview,” hover over the widget and click the pencil icon.\n\nAdd more competitors to the “Competitors” box, and click “Apply.” \n\nHere:\n\nThe widget will immediately display data for the competitors you added. \n\nOnce you’re done, click “Generate PDF report” on the top right. \n\nIn the pop-up, enable “Email report” and “Schedule report.” \n\nSelect your ideal time frame for the tool to run the report and email it to you.\n\nAnd click “Generate and send.” \n\nNow you have an easy and effective way to track and monitor performance against competitors. \n\nHow Often Should You Do a Competitor Analysis?\n\nYou should run a competitor analysis at least every quarter. And ideally every month. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause digital marketing is always changing. And you need to stay on top of what your competitors are doing. \n\nHowever, you may also want to do a competitor analysis even more frequently. \n\nEspecially if you notice any significant events or trends that affect your industry. \n\nFor example, you may want to do an ad-hoc competitor analysis if you’re:\n\nLaunching a new product or service\nEntering a new market or segment\nFacing a new competitor or losing market share\nChanging your pricing or positioning\nUpdating your branding or messaging\n\nWhatever frequency you choose, make sure to set a clear schedule and stick to it. \n\nDoing a competitor analysis can help you stay ahead of the curve and gain a competitive edge in your market.\n\nKeep Tabs on the Competition\n\nYou’ve learned how to conduct a competitive analysis and why it’s important for your business.\n\nBut don’t stop there. \n\nThe market is constantly changing, and so are your competitors. You need to keep an eye on their strategies, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.\n\nYou can do that with Market Explorer. It can help you:\n\nDiscover new competitors in your niche\nAnalyze your competitors’ performance, traffic sources, and growth trends\nBenchmark your website against them and identify gaps and opportunities\nIdentify the best channels and tactics to reach your target audience\nGet insights into your competitors’ customer behavior and preferences\n\nAnd more. \n\nGet a comprehensive overview of your competitive landscape and stay ahead of the game.\n\nRun a Competitive Analysis\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
