  "content": "Thinking of channeling your marketing efforts into a content pillar strategy? \n\nGood news: you’re in the right place.\n\nWe’ll dive into some impressive examples of pillar content that succeed both in generating traffic and establishing brands as experts on their topics. \n\nYou’ll also get a helpful workflow to build a high-performing content pillar to enhance your ranking and promote organic traffic growth.\n\nBut first, let’s explain how pillar pages work, what they look like, and why they’re important.\n\nWhat Are Content Pillars?\n\nContent pillars are the main topics your business regularly publishes content around on your website, social media, and other platforms. Focusing on key themes can help you build topical authority and engage target audiences more effectively.\n\nSome marketers use the term “content pillars” to refer to pillar pages. These are webpages that explore core topics in-depth. \n\nPillar pages should link to (and be linked from) cluster pages, which explore related subtopics. Together, a pillar page and its cluster pages create a topic cluster.\n\nLet’s say a digital marketing agency decides that SEO is one of their content pillars.\n\nSo they create an SEO topic cluster. Containing a pillar page entitled “The Ultimate Guide to SEO” and various cluster pages.\n\nLike this:\n\nWhy Are Content Pillars Important?\nPillars are content powerhouses that enhance organic rankings and propel traffic growth. \nThey showcase your expertise on the topic, and the interlinking structure helps give context to search engines. \n\nThese are just two reasons the pillar-cluster model is such an effective SEO strategy.\n\nContent pillars and clusters are also important for improving your rankings and authority through comprehensive topic coverage.\n\nPillars generate a lot of subtopics all from a single idea or theme. And clusters are perfect for targeting longtail keywords and subtopics your readers are looking for, such as conversational questions or queries, giving you lots of content ideas and opportunities to rank.\n\nThree Key Types of Content Pillars\n\nThere are three main types of pillar pages: the “Guide,” the “What Is,” and the “How-To.” We’ll look at examples of each type and see how they work.\n\nTo decide on the best type to choose for your pillar, it’s helpful to consider your audience's search intent (why they are entering a specific keyword) and adjust accordingly. \n\nThe Guide\n\nTypically a “guide” pillar page strives to give the reader a full view of a topic and everything they need to know on that subject. \n\nMany popular topics for guide pillar pages tend to be evergreen, and they can focus on things like a “101 for beginners” or an “ultimate guide to X.” On the other hand, they can be as sophisticated as an encyclopedic treatment of a topic. \n\nThe cluster pages for the guide will expand on particular aspects within the main topic, providing authoritative coverage on questions or specific topics the audience is interested in learning more about. \n\nExample of a Guide Pillar Page\n\nLet’s take this example of this pillar page from the Southern District of New York. It ranks on the first page of Google with the keyword phrase “How to file for bankruptcy in New York.”\n\nTitled “Understanding Bankruptcy,” the content on this pillar page provides a high-level overview of bankruptcy law, outlining the major themes, chapters, and courts involved in both personal and corporate bankruptcy matters. \n\nIn short, it’s devoted and optimized to provide the reader with everything they need in one place to get the information they’re looking for as quickly as possible. \n\nThe left sidebar contains a list of cluster topics such as free legal consultations, checklists and instructions, and filing fee information, as well as FAQs. These elements all work to support the main pillar topic, bankruptcy law.\n\nThe Guide is a great format to use when you want to provide an overview of the topic and answer your audience's main questions. \n\nNow let’s look at the “What Is” pillar page and some high-performing examples.\n\nThe What Is\n\nAs the name implies, a What Is pillar page strives to describe, define, and explain a topic in depth. \n\nThis strategy can be helpful if you’re trying to rank for a keyword targeted at a beginner audience, where you’re introducing a topic and then providing substantive materials that cover the topic in depth. \n\nIf the subject matter is complex enough, you can break down the themes or subtopics into chapters and segments.\n\nContent marketers can achieve an uptick in traffic by using this type of pillar page if the targeted keywords have a healthy search volume. Think of how many times you asked Google, “What is X, Y, or Z?” and it took you to a pillar page where you learned everything you needed to know about that topic.\n\nIf your topic is evergreen, you can leverage it to build a stellar backlink profile and promote your expertise within your industry or niche. \n\nExample of a What Is Pillar Page\n\nHere’s an example we created, “What Is SEO? A Beginner’s Guide to Search Engine Optimization.” \n\nWhat makes this impactful?\n\nFirst of all, each subtopic is organized by a table of contents that jumps to specific topics covered in greater detail within the article. \n\nIt follows the “what is,” “why is it important,” and “how to” structure, touching base on the most fundamental concepts around SEO. But it doesn’t go too deep into the details that would be suitable for a more advanced audience.\n\nSecondly, supporting elements such as illustrations, videos, and graphs are included within the body of the article. This gives the reader not one but two ways to absorb the content.\n\nThirdly, note that these more “snackable” elements are perfect for sharing on social media, email marketing, and other channels to promote the pillar content.\n\nThe How-To\n\nThe How-To pillar page seeks to inform and empower a reader on how to accomplish a task or solve a problem. \n\nThink of a tutorial or a step-by-step article that breaks down everything your audience needs to know on how to carry out a goal. \n\nRather than covering a broad topic (like the guide pillar page), the How-To provides more granular details. \n\nDepending on the topic and search intent, it could be used to describe a process for both beginner and experienced audiences.\n\nExample of a How-To Pillar Page\n\nWhile we’re using legal topics to describe effective pillar content strategies, let’s look at this example from Boundless - a page on how to get a marriage-based green card. \n\nThe content on the pillar page features an anchored table of contents below the fold that addresses the most important cluster topics focusing on timelines, eligibility, costs, forms and fees, and interview process details.\n\nYou can easily see the structure of the content cluster, with all important links gathered on the pillar page and every possible related question and subtopic covered by the company. All this creates a great experience for the user and sends positive signals to Google.\n\nNote that the page also incorporates strong calls to action to encourage the reader to apply immediately.\n\nIt also includes diverse content such as recent reviews from Trustpilot, additional resources about marriage green cards, and even an interactive green card checklist quiz.\n\nThe page ranks on Google in both positions 1 and 2, beating out Wikipedia’s page to boot!\n\nNow that we’ve looked at the three types of pillar pages with examples, let’s get into a workflow for building one.\n\nHow Do You Develop a Pillar Content Strategy for a Website? \n\nAs the great Sun Tzu famously said, “Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.” \n\nWhile we aren’t discussing the art of war here, the importance of strategic thinking in content creation is essential in achieving the desired outcome of any marketing effort. \n\nHere are the steps that should form the foundation for your content pillar strategy:\n\n1. Identify Your Content Pillar’s Topic and List Topics for Your Cluster Pages \n\nHigh-performing pillar pages tend to have two things in common:\n\nThey cover a topic that’s interesting, relevant, and essential for their target audience\nThe keyword has a healthy search volume and ranking potential\n\nStart with researching your audience. You can conduct interviews and send out customer surveys to identify their pain points. \n\nExamining customer questions and analyzing social media and community platforms can further paint the picture of your audience, and buyer personas can shed light on their online behaviors, demographics, and preferences. \n\nNext, identify the topic for your pillar page, and make sure it’s substantial enough to build a hub around. \n\nIdentify the Topic of Your Content Pillar \n\nStart with creating a list of high-level topics your audience is interested in. For example, if you are a law firm specializing in bankruptcy-related cases, you can start with creating content about questions and concerns your clients share the most.\n\nIf you’d like to make this process more data-driven and validate your topics, as well as find related ideas, use the Topic Research tool.\n\nLet’s use the example from earlier. Simply enter a high-level term (such as “bankruptcy”) and let the tool generate dozens of subtopics and themes related to it.\n\nYou can filter the subtopics by Volume, Difficulty, and Topic Efficiency, which takes both search volume and ranking difficulty into account.\n\nNow, choose topics that have the potential to generate traffic and look attainable for your website. It’s also important that you assess their overall relevance to your audience and your brand story or product offering, as well as their potential to become an evergreen content piece.\n\nPro Tip: After you’ve selected your topic, it’s time to work on the keyword research for your pillar page. Use the Keyword Magic Tool to help assess the primary keyword and find related ones.\n\nFor example, if you consider creating your pillar page about filing for bankruptcy, you have to find out whether the search volume and the keyword difficulty are optimal for your specific case.\n\nAfter you find a few appropriate seed keywords that support your chosen topics, find even more with Keyword Strategy Builder. \n\nFirst, enter your keywords. Then, click ‘create list.’ \n\nThat’s it—we’ll group the keywords together for you. \n\nFrom here, you can organize more topics and subtopics for your content plan.\n\nCreate a List of Topics for Your Cluster Pages\n\nNext, you'll need to construct the topics for your cluster pages. \n\nLet’s say our bankruptcy law firm is creating a pillar content piece that serves as a “What Is” resource for their clients. They can create cluster content based on highly relevant questions such as:\n\nWhat happens if someone files for bankruptcy?\nHow does bankruptcy work in the U.S.?\nWhat are the benefits of declaring bankruptcy?\nWhat assets can I keep if I go bankrupt?\nWhich debts can be discharged in a personal bankruptcy?\nCan I declare bankruptcy because of student loans?\n\nGo back to the Topic Research tool to explore the subtopics related to your future pillar page. \n\nFor example, if one of the subtopics you’ve identified seems a good fit for becoming the hub’s center, hover over it, click “Get ideas on this topic,” and keep exploring.\n\nAt this stage, you can start planning what format these subtopics will take—whether it’s a news article, blog, quiz, infographic, e-books, video, or something else. \n\nAfter you’ve identified your subtopics, it’s time to see if there’s already low-hanging fruit to optimize.\n\n2. Audit the Existing Content on Your Website\n\nNow that you have your list, you’ll want to perform a content audit on your website.\n\nThis helps you determine whether you already have existing pages that could be optimized for your pillar content strategy.\n\nIt also helps prevent creating any duplicate content or cannibalizing anything you’ve already published.\n\nIf you don’t have any content yet, you may need to reverse-engineer this process. \n\nMany content strategies can begin with creating the pillar page before the supporting cluster articles; it depends on what you already have and what you’ll need to create.\n\n3. Take a Look at the Competition\n\nUnless you’re creating content about an entirely original topic, chances are you have competition vying for the same space. \n\nYou’ll want to do competitive content analysis to identify gaps, opportunities, and advantages for your own pillar content. \n\nOne of the best ways to leapfrog the competition is to find areas where you can improve existing content. Topic gaps or thin pages can give you a headstart on creating something of value. \n\nPro Tip: Download the Competitive Analysis Template, an actionable, step-by-step guide to conducting content analysis. It comes with an editable Google Sheets file to document, benchmark, and analyze competitor strategies to your advantage. \n\nUse it to performing the following workflow:\n\n​​Analyze each of your competitor’s key content strategy elements\nDrive ideas and establish benchmarks for your own strategy\nSummarize the key findings and come up with actionable insights\n4. Create Your Content Pillar\n\nNow that you’ve identified your main topic and your clusters and have found an opportunity to shine among your competitors—it’s time to start creating the content!\n\nMap Out the Structure of Your Pillar Page\n\nThe next step is to collect all possible questions your pillar page will strive to answer and use them to design the structure of the article. \n\nTo do that, start by googling your target keywords and analyzing the content that ranks on page one. \n\nMake notes of the structure and formats of those pages, as well as the subsections and questions covered there.\n\nYou can also look at the “people also ask,” “things to know,” and “related searches” sections. \n\nFor example:\n\nYou can automate this step using AI content writing tools like ContentShake.\n\nSelect a content idea suggested by the tool or enter your own, and get a high-performing outline generated in an instant.\n\nYou’ll also get suggestions on headlines, keywords, introductions, and other information to include in your article. \n\nContentShake will also suggest the ideal length for your blog post and provide a list of target keywords.\n\nAfter you’ve written the content and you’re ready to go, it’s time to cover the importance of interlinking, promotion, and distribution.\n\n5. Interlink Your Pillar and Cluster Content\n\nInterlinking your cluster content to your pillar page (and between cluster pages) is essential to your information architecture. \n\nTo see this in action, check out Apple’s pillar page dedicated to the iPhone. It covers all the main information, such as device specs and comparisons, pricing plans, and carrier services. \n\nIt also links to cluster pages that cover specific questions that factor into the search intent—for example, articles that explain how to switch to an iPhone or how to qualify for a trade-in. \n\nApple’s pillar page provides the user with all the information they need in one place, and the interlinking structure provides deeper context for search engines.\n\n6. Distribute and Promote Your Pillar Content\n\nAs remarkable as your content may be, it won’t benefit anyone if it can’t be found. \n\nThat’s why having a content distribution plan should be a vital part of your content strategy. You wouldn’t spend 50 hours creating your content and only share it once, right?\n\nThere are a number of channels and methods to both internally and externally promote your pillar content. Here are some of the first places you can begin to increase traffic to your content:\n\nSocial Media\n\nPillars and clusters give social media marketers a huge advantage in filling up their content calendars. Pillars are loaded with content that can be broken down and repurposed for your audience on social media. And if your content is based around an evergreen topic or idea, even better. \n\nLooking back at Boundless’ guide to marriage-based green cards, they successfully break down key messages and facts from their pillar page, repurposing it to their social audience. \n\nHere’s a piece of cluster content that was repurposed as a video post for Facebook:\n\nYou can experiment with different copy, graphics, and calls-to-action to distribute and promote your content forever. If you have a budget for paid promotion, consider boosting your best-performing organic posts to reach new audiences and expand your universe.\n\nEmail Blasts\n\nAccording to research from the Content Marketing Institute, 87% of B2B and 76% of B2C marketers are using email as an organic marketing vehicle. That makes it one of the most popular ways to distribute content to a qualified audience. \n\nConsider highlighting some cluster topics and creating multiple email newsletters to bring your email contacts back to your website.\n\nNot only could it generate immediate leads, but it could also support your subject matter expertise and spark up traffic to your website.\n\nPitch to Influencers\n\nReach out to bloggers, thought leaders, and other relevant influencers who would be interested in sharing your content. Using the Backlink Gap Tool can help you identify linking opportunities based on your top competitors to develop an outreach plan. \n\nDon’t exclusively pitch your pillar content as a package—identify specific cluster topics, pages, visuals, and other elements that could interest a backlink prospect.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, your pillar content has the highest potential of getting lots of backlinks since it covers the topic in-depth. \n\nYou could also pitch an official press release and promote it with a content distribution or wire service to target specific audiences or geographies based on your business objectives.\n\nWhich Is Better: Evergreen or Timely Pillar Content? \n\nIn a perfect world, your content marketing strategy should include a diversity of timely pieces as well as evergreen content. But what’s best in this scenario? \n\nPillar pages centered on evergreen content can perform especially well with both readers and search engines, provided you have enough high-quality cluster topics to support it.\n\nFor example, let’s say you are a news publisher and, during your content audit, discover you already have dozens of articles that followed a historical event. \n\nEncyclopedia Britannica has done an exceptional job with its page on Hurricane Katrina. The body of the pillar contains an overview of the event supported by internal links to cluster topics found elsewhere on the website. \n\nFrom fast facts and photo galleries to video explainers, additional information, and top questions, this pillar page strategy is on point.\n\nOn the other hand, let’s say you’re a technology solution provider. Perhaps you’ve noted that customers are frequently requesting product or service updates. \n\nIt may be an effective strategy to build an authoritative pillar page that contains both evergreen as well as timely content about new product features and releases.\n\nThis example from WordPress has an engaging pillar page that covers all matters of support with their product. By including various content pieces, blogs, and news updates, a user looking for support on their platform can easily find it.\n\nWhether a WordPress user is looking for general support, installation information, or wants to read about the latest updates, they can get everything they need on this page alone. (Bonus user-experience points for the search bar feature above the fold!)\n\nElevate Your Brand with Content Pillars \n\nFor content marketers, the pillar-cluster content model allows us to be more strategic and consider what readers truly want, and to create winning content that overrides the noise from the competition.\n\nAnd just like the pillars of a building need to exhibit strength and good form, so does a content pillar strategy. It should serve a purpose to your audience while elevating your brand’s subject matter expertise.\n\nReady to take action?
