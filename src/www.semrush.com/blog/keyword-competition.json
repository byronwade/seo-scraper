  "content": "What Is Keyword Competition?\n\nKeyword competition is a metric that indicates how difficult it’ll be to rank prominently for a given search query in search engines like Google. Which helps you understand your potential to generate traffic from a particular keyword (because higher-ranking results usually get more clicks).\n\nCompetition is most commonly referenced in pay-per-click (PPC) marketing.\n\nIn PPC, high competition means you’ll have to pay higher costs and meet higher standards to have ads appear for a keyword.\n\nKeyword competition is also a concept in search engine optimization (SEO). But it’s more commonly known as keyword difficulty.\n\nIn SEO, high difficulty means you need to meet higher standards (in terms of content quality, user experience, and/or website authority) to earn a prominent unpaid ranking.\n\nNote\n\nLater on, we’ll explain how to check keyword competition with the Keyword Overview tool.\n\nHow Is Keyword Competition Calculated?\n\nKeyword research tools calculate keyword competition in different ways.\n\nIn Google Keyword Planner, two metrics represent keyword competition in paid search results:\n\nCompetition: The number of advertisers bidding on the keyword relative to all keywords across Google. If enough data is available, there will be a “High,” “Medium,” or “Low” rating. \nCompetition (indexed value): The number of ad slots filled divided by the number of ad slots available—expressed as a percentage. For example, a score of 75 means a quarter of available ad spaces are unfilled.\n\nIn Semrush, there’s a PPC metric called competitive density. It represents the number of advertisers bidding on a given term on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 (anything above 0.8 is considered highly competitive).\n\nSemrush also includes a keyword difficulty (KD %) score that’s expressed as a percentage. Which helps you understand organic competition levels (anything above 50% is considered difficult to rank for).\n\nThis metric is based on numerous factors, including:\n\nThe median number of domains that link to the top 10 URLs\nThe median Authority Scores of the top 10 domains\nCharacteristics of the search engine results page (SERP)\n\nIf you enter your domain, you can get a Personal Keyword Difficulty (PKD %) score. Which represents ranking difficulty for your site in particular.\n\nIt considers your own Authority Score, number of referring domains, etc.\n\nWhy Are Some Terms More Competitive Than Others?\n\nCompetition levels vary because some terms are more likely to drive traffic and results than others. \n\nTo better understand this, consider that keyword competition typically has a positive correlation with two main factors:\n\nKeyword search volume: The average number of monthly searches the keyword gets. Higher-volume keywords tend to have wider appeal and relevancy, so they attract more attention and investment. More specific keywords (known as long-tail keywords) tend to have lower volumes and competition levels.\nPurchase intent: How ready the searcher is to make a purchase. This is particularly important in PPC, because most advertisers want to generate a direct return on their ad spend. (In SEO, it’s more feasible to cost-effectively reach users at all stages of the buying journey.)\n\nWhen you do SEO keyword research or PPC keyword research in Semrush, you can see average monthly search volumes alongside keyword competition metrics. And you’ll likely see this correlation.\n\nYou can also view the type of search intent (what the user is hoping to achieve with their search) behind each keyword. Which helps you understand the level of purchase intent.\n\nIntent Type\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nPurchase Intent Level\n\n\n\n\nInformational (I)\n\n\t\n\nThe user is seeking information\n\n\t\n\nLow\n\n\n\n\nCommercial (C)\n\n\t\n\nThe user is researching a brand, product, or service\n\n\t\n\nMedium to High\n\n\n\n\nNavigational (N)\n\n\t\n\nThe user is seeking a specific website or webpage\n\n\t\n\nMedium to High\n\n\n\n\nTransactional (T)\n\n\t\n\nThe user is ready to take action (e.g., make a purchase)\n\n\t\n\nHigh\n\nHow to Check Keyword Competition\n\nTo check competition levels for keywords you’ve already chosen, enter your term(s) into the Keyword Overview tool. \n\nThen enter your domain, choose your target country, and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll immediately see the competitive density and Personal Keyword Difficulty scores.\n\nBut the tool is much more than a keyword competition checker. It also provides search volumes, intent types, keyword ideas, and more.\n\nTo check competition levels as you’re discovering new keywords, use the Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a term to base your search around, along with your domain and target country. Then, click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will collect “Broad Match” keywords that contain your starting term or a close variation.\n\nAnd display various keyword metrics. Including competitive density, keyword difficulty, and Personal Keyword Difficulty scores.\n\nSemrush also provides competition metrics in other tools, including:\n\nKeyword Gap, which lets you compare your keyword rankings against competitors’\nPosition Tracking, which lets you monitor your rankings for target keywords\nOrganic Research, which lets you check keyword rankings for a chosen domain\nAdvertising Research, which lets you review any domain’s Google search ads\n\nAnalyze Keyword Competition\n\nwith Semrush’s Toolkit\n\nSign Up Now →\nHow to Compete for Desirable Terms\n\nIn SEO, it’s wise to target keywords with a 0%-49% (“Very Easy” to “Possible”) PKD%. Because these are more likely to yield high rankings and conversions.\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool lets you filter for keywords in your chosen range:\n\nKeywords will become relatively easier to rank for as you improve your website’s authority.\n\nYou can do that by:\n\nCreating quality content that caters to your audience’s needs\nIncreasing your topical authority by covering relevant topics comprehensively\nUsing link building to improve your site’s perceived authority\nMaintaining a solid foundation of good technical SEO\nFollowing our on-page SEO checklist to optimize your content for search\n\nPPC makes it possible to rank prominently for keywords that are inaccessible through SEO.\n\nBut it’s not as simple as making higher bids than your competitors.\n\nYou also need to create high-quality ads that align with user needs. And build fast-loading, conversion-focused landing pages.\n\nTrack Your Performance for Competitive Keywords\n\nOnce you’ve started targeting terms with your ads and content, track your keyword rankings.\n\nThis will give you a sense of how competitive your site is and whether your strategy is working. So you can make more informed decisions in the future.\n\nWith Semrush’s Position Tracking tool, you can monitor your performance in Google’s paid and organic results. And easily reference the KD % keyword competition metric.\n\nMonitor Your Rankings\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
