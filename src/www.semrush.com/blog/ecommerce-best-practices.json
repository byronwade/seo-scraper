  "content": "Online shopping is a cornerstone of modern commerce. \n\nShoppers are increasingly likely to turn to the internet before heading out to their local shopping center. This has opened up a massive opportunity for ecommerce businesses.\n\nEcommerce business owners willing to put the work in to optimize their website will benefit most from the opportunity. \n\nBut where do you begin?\n\nHere’s a list of 16 unmissable ecommerce best practices we’ve put together to guide you.\n\n1. Build Trust with Your Audience\n\nConvincing potential customers of your credibility is an essential first step to converting them into buyers.\n\nBuild trust with users by making your online business website appear trustworthy. That means using consistent branding, high-quality product images, and modern web design.\n\nTo really make an impact, use established online trust signals. These are visible elements on your site that customers associate with credibility. \n\nFor example, a site-wide SSL certificate reassures your users that their personal data and credit card information are safely encrypted.\n\nWebsites with an SSL certificate display a lock icon in browser search bars. \n\nSecurity indications build trust. They can also boost your visibility. Google factors security into its assessment of a website’s search engine optimization (SEO). \n\nHere’s how:\n\nThe encryption provided by an SSL certificate allows URLs to use the HTTPS protocol—a confirmed Google ranking signal since 2014.\n\nCustomer reviews, testimonials, and case studies are another type of trust signal. They act as social proof, showing potential customers that the site isn’t a scam. \n\nAmazon, one of the biggest ecommerce sites, puts reviews front and center on every product page.\n\nOther common trust signals for ecommerce sites include:\n\nBadges representing awards or certifications won\nLogos of prominent customers (used by websites that sell to other businesses)\nBadges showing membership to reputable organizations, like the Better Business Bureau Accreditation\n2. Use High-Quality Images\n\nGood product images can make a big difference in ecommerce performance, influencing customers’ purchasing decisions.\n\nThey’re one of the most important elements of product pages. 50% of online shoppers say images help them decide what to buy.\n\nThe right product photos can show off quality and features that are hard to articulate in writing.\n\nThe screenshot below shows the top image results for “red men’s t-shirt.” Each result is a high-quality image from a retail brand’s product page. \n\nA great image opens these vendors up to new traffic from searchers browsing image results instead of the regular website links.\n\nBest practices for producing images that help convince people to buy include:\n\nPhotographing your products in good lighting with a high-quality camera\nUploading photos from multiple angles. It gives customers a sense of what the physical product looks like.\nCompressing images to reduce their impact on page speed\n3. Invest in On-Page SEO\n\nOn-page SEO boosts visibility, driving more organic traffic by making it easier for potential customers to find your site. \n\nOn-page SEO involves optimizing webpage elements to increase search engine rankings. It focuses on commercial or transactional keywords—types of keywords people search when they’re researching products or want to make a purchase.\n\nThose keywords appear in elements like the page text, headers, and image descriptions. (This is different from off-page SEO, which focuses on optimization that happens outside of your website.) \n\nThe category and product pages that make up the bulk of most ecommerce sites are both great places to rank for these crucial keywords. Because these are the pages that meet users’ search intent of finding and buying products. \n\nBoost your chances of ranking for target keywords with these on-page SEO steps:\n\n1. Carry out keyword research using a tool like Semrush’s Keyword Magic. It can help you generate keyword ideas to attract traffic in your niche.\n\nLeverage the Ecommerce Keyword Analytics app to analyze top-performing keywords from major e-tailers. This will improve your ecommerce keyword strategy by including keywords proven to convert on top merchant sites. \n\nFor example, this screenshot shows that the green line for “yoga mat towel” has a higher conversion rate than the other keywords (yoga mat, yoga mat bag, yoga block). \n\n3. Use the target keywords you find in each page’s main content, title tag, meta description, and H1 (make sure to use them naturally and avoid keyword stuffing)\n\n4. Look for other opportunities to insert your target keywords, including in the alt text for images on the page\n\nGet Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n\n5. Use a tool like Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker to make sure you’ve covered every optimization opportunity\n\nThe On Page SEO Checker dashboard shows you areas of weakness across your site. Plus recommendations for strengthening performance in each area.\n\n4. Prioritize a Great User Experience\n\nOptimize your website for user experience (UX) factors to increase traffic, maximize user retention, and boost sales.\n\nUX factors determine how easy and enjoyable your site is to use. This, in turn, determines how long people spend on your site. \n\nThe longer users spend on your site, the greater the chance they’ll buy something from you. \n\nThere are countless UX design factors to consider. Look at those that streamline the experience for your website visitors. Like intuitive store navigation or easy payment options. \n\nIt’s also important to consider factors that Google’s search ranking algorithm takes into account. These include:\n\nAccessibility: Features that ensure all users can understand and interact with your website content, regardless of physical or cognitive disabilities. Like image alt text and screen reader compatibility.\nReadability: Techniques to make your page content highly legible on desktop and mobile devices. For example, using an appropriate font size and a high-contrast color scheme.\nCore Web Vitals: A set of three page-loading performance metrics for how long it takes for content to appear (Largest Contentful Paint), the response time to the user’s first interaction (First Input Delay), and how much the main content layout shifts unexpectedly (Cumulative Layout Shift)\nYou can measure these three core web vitals with a tool like Google’s proprietary PageSpeed Insights.\n\nThe report will show you results for both mobile and desktop devices. And provide suggestions on how to improve your scores.\n\n5. Minimize Website Load Times\n\nOptimizing how fast your website pages load can both increase your keyword rankings and boost user retention.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nLoading speed directly impacts bounce rate. This metric measures the percentage of users who leave your site without interacting with it. \n\nThe probability of a user leaving your website before it loads increases dramatically after three seconds.\n\nPageSpeed Insights can identify slow-loading pages on your website. You can run URLs through it to get a comprehensive report including:\n\nSeparate tabs for mobile and desktop performance\nA detailed Core Web Vitals assessment\nA speed performance score out of 100\nSpecific tips on how to improve page load speed\n\nAll of that information is contained in one report dashboard. Like this:\n\nThe report makes diagnosing and fixing any site speed issues simple. \n\nPageSpeed Insights lets you run a report for one page at a time. For a complete overview of your website’s overall page speed performance, use a tool like Semrush’s Site Audit. \n\nIf you haven’t set up a project in Semrush yet, start by entering your website’s URL in the search bar. Click the “Start Audit” button. \n\nYou’ll see this dashboard when the audit completes:\n\nFor information on your site load times, click on the “View details” button in the “Site Performance” box. \n\nThis will open a summary of technical performance. Including a breakdown of page speed across your entire website. \n\nClick on the “X issues” button next to “Slow page (HTML) load speed.” You’ll find out where your page speed is lagging and get suggestions for how to fix it.\n\nFind and Fix Technical SEO Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n6. Optimize for Mobile Users\n\nAround 70% of ecommerce website traffic comes from users on mobile devices. Make the most of your biggest traffic source by prioritizing a great mobile customer experience.\n\nFurther reading: Get data and insights on mobile strategies in Semrush’s latest ecommerce report, Futureproof Your Business With Ecommerce Market Insights.\n\nYour content should be easy to read and interact with on smaller devices. This means you should pay attention to things like: \n\nUsing an appropriate font size \nLarge call-to-action buttons \nShort paragraphs \nPlenty of white space\n\nThe best way to ensure your site is mobile-friendly is to use a responsive design. \n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nResponsive design is a website development technique that automatically reformats content to suit different screen sizes.\n\nYou can manually tweak your website design to be responsive. Or pick one of many templates available from site-building tools and designers to do the work for you.\n\nGoogle also pays attention to responsiveness. A responsive design indicates to the search engine that you’re applying its mobile-first best practices. Meaning more visibility for your site.\n\n7. Make Navigation Simple and Intuitive\n\nTailor your website navigation so users can find what they’re looking for quickly. This will prevent them from getting frustrated and visiting a competitor instead.\n\nWebsite architecture, or the hierarchy of pages and how they’re connected, can be complex for ecommerce sites. \n\nThe more categories, subcategories, and product pages your site has, the harder it is for users to navigate through. And a disorganized site structure only makes things more difficult.\n\nOffer the best user experience by focusing on a simple and intuitive website structure. Starting with a well-organized page hierarchy. \n\nYou can do this with URL subfolders so that each page sits beneath its parent page.\n\nexample.com\nexample.com/category-1\nexample.com/category-1/subcategory-1\nexample.com/category-2\nexample.com/category-2/subcategory-1\nexample.com/category-2/subcategory-2\n\nBut you should reinforce that URL structure with intuitive navigation options. \n\nHow do you achieve that exactly?\n\nBy making sure every parent page has at least one link to every subcategory or product page that sits beneath it. Every subpage should have a link back to its parent page.\n\nThis doesn’t just affect user navigation. It also ensures that Google can find every important page when crawling your website.\n\nThat means Google can store those pages in its index, which is necessary for them to rank for their target keywords.\n\n8. Look Out for Internal Linking Opportunities\n\nInternal links are links from one page on your website to another. Include them to make it easy for users to get to the pages they’re looking for. \n\nInternal links provide an alternative to the search bar. They also prompt users down new paths, presenting them with more opportunities to explore your ecommerce website. \n\nThere are four main internal link types to use on an ecommerce site:\n\nLinks in the main navigation bar, which typically appears on every page and includes all category pages\nHomepage links to start users off on their journey. These also typically lead to the main category pages.\nSidebar links on category and subcategory pages to hop between different categories\nIn-text hyperlinks to push users from blog posts or other informational landing pages toward commercial pages or other relevant information\n\nThere isn’t much room to get creative with the main navigation menu. Most ecommerce sites use it the same way: as an overview of all category pages. \n\nBut you can find plenty of opportunities elsewhere.\n\nFor example, a banner on your homepage to put a spotlight on new category or subcategory pages as they go live. \n\nYou can also add a “related products”' section to all product pages, linking to the most similar product pages. This should keep users on-site if the product they want is out of stock or not quite right.\n\nAs your site gets larger, internal links become more important. Use them effectively to ensure every page on your website is reachable by both users and Google’s crawlers.\n\nPro tip: Learn how to make the most of your internal links with Internal Links: Ultimate Guide + Strategies.\n\n9. Build Useful Product Filters\n\nProduct filters on category pages help users sort your products to focus on what they’re interested in. This improves their experience (and the chances they’ll stay on your page and buy).\n\nProduct filters are especially important for ecommerce sites that stock lots of products. \n\nIndividual category pages can contain hundreds or thousands of products. Filters allow users to narrow down their view by particular features or specifications.\n\nWhat filter options to provide depends on what you’re selling. \n\nFor instance, a men’s t-shirt category page on a fashion ecommerce store might include the following filters:\n\nSize\nColor\nFit\nPrice\nMaterial\n\nMake sure you understand what’s important to your users. Then build filters that are relevant and useful to them.\n\n10. Write Effective Product Descriptions\n\nGood product descriptions can help increase your conversion rate and generate more revenue.\n\nA product description’s first and most important job is to reduce or remove barriers to conversion. It anticipates and overcomes reservations, addresses the user’s pain points, and explains how it solves them.\n\nWhat does this mean in practice?\n\nFor some products, it’s going into detail about the quality of construction in an FAQ section. For others, it involves listing features or capabilities. \n\nIt might even be as simple as stating that shipping is free. \n\nThe product description below contains plenty of useful information for potential customers, including technical specifications.\n\nUse your descriptions to encourage hesitant potential customers to purchase. How? By addressing obstacles they might be concerned about. \n\nMake sure your descriptions are easy to read and present the right tone for your brand. \n\nAnd consider the effects on SEO.\n\nSEO-friendly product descriptions aren’t just persuasive. They’re also optimized around the page’s target keywords.\n\nUse a tool like Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant to create reader-friendly product descriptions that contribute to your keyword rankings.\n\nSimply type or paste your description into the main text box. Then enter your keywords in the field on the right and click “Get recommendations.”\n\nYou’ll get a report with insights on readability, originality, SEO-friendliness, and tone of voice.\n\nThe full report provides simple guidance on how to improve each factor, plus additional keyword suggestions.\n\n11. Offer Valuable Content\n\nBuild and deploy a content marketing strategy to boost your traffic and attract more potential customers.\n\nInformational content like blog posts, how-tos, and guides can help you build trust and relationships with your target audience. \n\nEducational content shows off your expertise. While brand stories make your company more relatable. \n\nContent also opens up brand-new SEO opportunities for ecommerce sites. You stand a good chance of ranking for keywords outside your product descriptions. \n\nFirst, you need to know what keywords to target. \n\nSemrush’s Organic Research tool can be a big help in this process. You can analyze your top competitors’ websites and easily identify what informational keywords they rank for.\n\nOnce you have topics to write about, draft your content using content creation tools to make sure it’s well-optimized.\n\nFind Competitors\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nSEO Content Template is a great place to start. Enter a target keyword, and the tool will generate an ideal content outline to use as a basis for your writing.\n\n12. Attract Users Throughout the Marketing Funnel\n\nFigure out ways to target users throughout their buying journey to grow your traffic and make more sales.\n\nIdeally, your website will attract users who are close to making a buying decision. But there’s plenty of opportunity to generate traffic from elsewhere in the marketing funnel. \n\nThe marketing funnel has four main stages:\n\nAwareness: Users have just become aware of a product need\nConsideration: Users are in the process of narrowing down their options\nConversion: Users are ready to make a purchase and need a final push\nLoyalty: Users have already converted and now have brand affinity\n\nEach stage offers an opportunity to grow your online store’s traffic. You can capture all of them with a diverse range of page types.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nUsers in the awareness stage need information. They’re typically in the process of researching a product. \n\nTarget them with informational content that answers their questions. In the process, you’ll make them aware of your brand. That way, they’re more likely to remember you when they reach the conversion stage. \n\nUsers in the consideration stage are comparing different products to make a purchase decision. Target them through content that puts your product head-to-head with competitors.\n\nMore users captured at the top of the marketing funnel = more potential customers.\n\n13. Minimize Barriers to Conversion\n\nBarriers to conversion stop a visitor from becoming a customer. Minimizing them can increase conversions.\n\nA study by the Baymard Institute found that the average ecommerce shopping cart abandonment rate is 70%. The investigation revealed that the top barriers to conversion were:\n\nExtra costs (shipping, tax, fees, etc.) being too high\nWebsite requiring an account to check out\nDelivery times being too slow\nLow trust in the website’s credibility\nCheckout process that was too long or complicated\n\nYou can only avoid some of these factors with changes to your business model. But you can address the others through simple changes to your website.\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nAvoid forcing potential customers to create an account by adding guest checkout functionality. Like this “Continue as Guest” button:\n\nReverse low trust by adding more evidence of your brand’s credibility during checkout. Include things like customer reviews or industry awards in prominent places on the checkout page.\n\nAdd payment options like PayPal to convert users who are hesitant to enter their credit card details.\n\n14. Create a Retargeting Plan\n\nTrack site visitor interactions. So you can continue to reach out to those who show interest but leave your site before making a purchase.\n\nEven the best ecommerce sites don’t convert 100% of the time. Retargeting tactics help you find users who drop off during checkout and reach them again. \n\nOne of the most popular tactics involves tracking users on your website and targeting them with personalized ads. \n\nThe process works like this:\n\nA potential customer visits your site where tracking cookies or software pick them up. They leave without converting.\nYou create a remarketing campaign on a paid ads platform like Google Ads. Using the tracking data to target lost users.\nYour retargeting ads reach the lost users on Google search engine results pages (SERPs) or other websites.\nSome of the retargeted users click on the ads and end up on your site. They have a second chance to convert.\n\nEmail is another popular channel for retargeting. In email retargeting, you contact lost users or previous customers directly through their inbox. But it first requires you to collect their email address legally.\n\nThe email below reaches out to previous customers. A discount code encourages them to return to the site for another purchase.\n\nBoth these retargeting tactics can be successful revenue drivers if you set them up effectively.\n\nRetargeted users are already familiar with your brand. That means your website has less work to do here to persuade them to convert.\n\n15. Keep Your Website in Good Health\n\nSchedule regular site health checks so you continue to acquire and convert users.\n\nEcommerce websites are particularly prone to degradation. It’s not uncommon to delete discontinued product pages without redirecting them to another page, for example. \n\nThis can cause both UX and technical SEO issues. \n\nUsers following links to these deleted pages get a 404 status code. Which might lead them to exit the site altogether. Plus, the 404 pages will lose any keyword rankings they had.\n\nThe simple solution: Stay on top of your website’s health with an automatic technical auditing tool like Site Audit. \n\nRun an audit as outlined in best practice No. 5. The main dashboard will update to reflect your site’s general technical health. \n\nIt will highlight errors, warnings, and notices you need to pay attention to.\n\nThe “Thematic Reports” section links to more detailed reports with suggestions for fixing any issues.\n\nThe reports cover areas including: \n\nPages that Google can’t reach\nPages with slow load speeds\nBroken internal links leading to deleted pages\nRedirect chains that can cause loading issues\n\nSet up Site Audit to run regular audits. It will help you respond to any concerns right away and keep your site in good working order.\n\n16. Leverage Social Media Platforms\n\nExtend your ecommerce brand’s presence to the top social media platforms. You’ll reach new audiences and drive more traffic to your site.\n\nEstimates put the total number of social media users worldwide close to 5 billion. That’s a huge potential audience. \n\nBeing active on platforms like Facebook and Instagram will get your marketing message in front of more people. When you want to announce new products or sales, for instance. \n\nYou can also boost audience engagement and views by hosting giveaways or contests. \n\nBetween the Covers Bookstore entered followers in this Easter giveaway for liking the post, following the brand, and tagging a friend:\n\nSocials can double up as customer support channels. They give your customers the chance to get in touch directly. So you can respond and resolve their concerns quickly.\n\nAnd they act as vehicles for social proof to make your brand more trustworthy. Satisfied customers can give you a shoutout on your page or highlight your brand in hashtags. Both actions will grow your visibility with their connections.\n\nEcommerce Best Practices Can Boost Your Online Sales\n\nEach of the above best practices can impact your ecommerce website’s ability to attract and convert customers. The challenge lies in implementing them effectively.\n\nTo get the most out of your optimization efforts, test out one change at a time. Get started with Site Audit so you’ll know what you need to focus on first.\n\nFind and Fix Technical SEO Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
