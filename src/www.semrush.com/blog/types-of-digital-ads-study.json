  "content": "Have you ever wished you could peek behind the curtain and see the exact ad types your competitors are spending their advertising budget on? In our latest study, we dived into that exact question.\n\nThis study looked into the advertising trends of almost 1,000 domains across various industries, with the goal of helping you benchmark your own ad strategy.\n\nBy partnering with AdClarity, we’ve investigated ad types, ad channels and ad spend so you can plan and strategize with the kind of competitive edge that other players don’t have in your industry.\n\nIn case you missed it, this is a follow-up to the first installment of this series—Using Competitor Ad Spending Data for Benchmarking. For even deeper insight into how your industry is advertising, watch this space for more insights to come.\n\nFor now, though, let’s dive into the different types of digital ads and how their popularity fluctuates between domains and industries. \n\nIf you want to check out the data on more specific competitor ad types, you can uncover detailed breakdowns of your niche competitors’ advertising campaigns with AdClarity here.\n\nTypes of Digital Ads\n\nFirst, let’s define the types of digital ads that you’ll encounter in social media, display, and video advertising channels. \n\nHere’s a list of all the formats that were included in the analysis:\n\nBanner: A combination of text and images in a portrait, landscape or square format. These ad types appear in the display, social, and video channels.\nCarousel: A series of texts, images or videos on a cycle, combined into one ad. Carousels can appear in social and display advertising.\nHTML5 Animated: An interactive display ad with animated text and images or video designed to catch the eye of the viewer through motion.\nHTML5 Static: A static display ad that uses still images and text to catch the eye and call the viewer to action.\nIn-stream video: A video ad that appears within other videos on social networks. \nPromoted account: An ad that appears like a normal post on a platform such as X, but has been bought or ‘sponsored’ by the advertiser to promote their account.\nVideo: A video ad that might appear on the likes of YouTube or streaming services.\nVideo Masthead: A video feature that allows advertisers to place their ads in prominent positions, such as on the YouTube home screen, across multiple devices. \nOur Methodology\n\nThe three channels for digital advertising we investigated in our study were: \n\nSocial (social video and display ads)\nVideo (desktop, mobile, and in-app video ads)\nDisplay (desktop, mobile, and in-app display ads)\n\nTo understand how these channels were most commonly utilized, we looked at the ad types (listed above) published by 956 domains from the top players in 13 industries in the US. The timescale stretched from January 2021 to May 2023 to allow any trends to reveal themselves over time.\n\nDiscover more about our methodology in the first blog of the series here: Using Competitor Ad Spending Data for Benchmarking.\n\nDigital Ad Spending by Industry\n\nBy way of a quick recap, we saw last time that the Retail industry was the clear leader when it came to total ad spend. At $443.4M per month, it spent 95% more than the second-biggest spender, Streaming Services, over the selected time period: \n\nDigital Ad Spending by Channel\n\nBreaking that spending down by channel, we see right away how popular social media was across the industries, with an average adoption rate of 51%:\n\nSocial Media Ad Spending Distribution\n\nIn terms of specific publishers in the social field, there was a runaway winner there, too, with Facebook attracting almost $2.5B in total spend:\n\nPUBLISHER\n\n\t\n\nSPEND\n\n\nFacebook\t\n\n$2,486,819,048\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\t\n\n$589,559,266\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\t\n\n$176,881,432\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\t\n\n$58,984,254\n\nThis accounted for over three-quarters of total ad spend for all advertisers, with Instagram coming in a distant second place: \n\nIf we bring YouTube into the mix, which AdClarity classifies as a video platform and not a social platform, we can see that it eclipsed Instagram in terms of total spend, but was still over $1B behind Facebook:\n\nPUBLISHER_DOMAIN\n\n\t\n\nSPEND\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\t\n\n$2,486,819,048\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\t\n\n$1,325,080,859\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\t\n\n$589,559,266\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\t\n\n$176,881,432\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\t\n\n$58,984,254\n\nAn interesting pattern reveals itself when we zoom out to see ad spend over time. While social media ad spend accounted for more than 40% of the total at all times, the levels of spend on video and display changed quite dramatically: \n\nInterestingly, though, they returned to around the level at which they started on this timescale by May 2023.\n\nSocial media was the most popular channel for the Fashion, Food Delivery and Online Education industries, and the least popular for Home Décor, Pets and, perhaps surprisingly, Retail.\n\nDomains in the SaaS, Travel and Pets industries made heavy use of video to advertise themselves, but Media and Dating didn’t lean so much on the medium. \n\nDisplay advertising was the channel of choice for Dating, Retail and Home Décor, but this wasn’t the case in the Fashion and Food Delivery industries.\n\nYou can take a look at YouTube and Facebook as publishers in more depth in the AdClarity app here, and delve into the specific advertisers and campaigns on each platform over time.\n\nPopular Ad Types by Industry\n\nNow, let’s get into ad spending by ad type across the 13 industries. The chart below shows us how common HTML5 Static ads were almost across the board, particularly with players in the Retail and Travel industries: \n\nStreaming Services were the most likely to opt for banner ads, but the overall popularity of display ads was low. This could be because such banner ads, whether static or animated, are more often used in apps or on social media platforms nowadays, rather than on websites. \n\nAverage Digital Ad Lifetime\n\nAnother useful insight for your planning and strategy around digital ads comes from the average length of time each type of ad tended to remain live.\n\nDespite being employed less frequently amongst our chosen domains, display banners stayed live for the longest at an average of 135 days. By comparison, video had a shorter shelf life of 53 days, indicating the need to roll out fresh creative more often in that format.\n\nChannel\n\n\t\n\nCreative Type\n\n\t\n\nAge (days)\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\n\n\t\n\nBanner\n\n\t\n\n135\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\n\n\t\n\nHTML5 Animated\n\n\t\n\n80\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\t\n\nVideo\n\n\t\n\n53\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\n\t\n\nBanner\n\n\t\n\n49\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\n\n\t\n\nHTML5 Static\n\n\t\n\n36\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\n\n\t\n\nCarousel\n\n\t\n\n26\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\n\t\n\nPromoted account\n\n\t\n\n25\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\t\n\nBanner\n\n\t\n\n21\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\t\n\nVideo Masthead\n\n\t\n\n19\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\n\t\n\nIn-Stream Video\n\n\t\n\n11\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\n\t\n\nCarousel\n\n\t\n\n10\n\nCarousels and in-stream videos only lasted 10-11 days on social media, which could be a sign that due diligence wasn’t always paid in the research and testing phases for those ads. \n\nVideos in particular are usually more expensive to create than other media formats, so it’s crucial that the content they are presenting is thoroughly researched before including them in a social media advertising campaign.\n\nThe longer lifetime of banner ads suggests that they were relied upon for broader reach in brand campaigns rather than, for instance, product-specific launches. The findings indicate that they are a good bet for long-term advertising, particularly for well-known brands that want to remain in the spotlight. \n\nVideos, in contrast, might have a greater impact in short-term campaigns when urgent sales targets need to be hit.\n\nLooking Closer with AdClarity \n\nWith the insights this study has revealed, you can benchmark social media advertising against the top advertisers in your industry with a far better understanding of their overall spend levels and preferred ad types. \n\nIf you want a closer analysis, AdClarity allows you to dig even deeper by searching for specific competitors and analyzing their campaigns and even their creative.
