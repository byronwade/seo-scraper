  "content": "From managing your schedule and providing information to assisting with content creation, an AI assistant can help you complete time-consuming or resource-heavy tasks.\n\nThey’re personal sidekicks that use artificial intelligence to streamline your workflow and increase productivity.\n\nBut with so many AI tools on the market, choosing the right one can be overwhelming.\n\nTo help you cut through the noise, we’ve curated a list of some of the best to make daily work more efficient and convenient.\n\n1. AI Video Marketing Automator: Repurpose Your Content\n\nAI Video Marketing Automator uses AI to turn prompts, and even entire blog posts, into engaging videos in seconds. \n\nYou can then upload your videos to your website or social media channels to drive traffic, increase engagement, and improve your search engine optimization (SEO).\n\nLike all the best AI assistants, AI Video Marketing Automator produces results with minimum effort.\n\nPaste in an article URL, choose which illustration type you want to use (e.g., 3D illustrations, hand-drawn illustrations, or simple illustrations), and click “Create Video.”\n\nAI Video Marketing Automator takes your headings, text, and images. And turns them into an engaging draft video, read aloud by a human-like AI voiceover.\n\nYou can—and should—then review and edit the draft to change the voice, music, and style to match your brand.\n\nOnce you’re happy, you can export your video in landscape, portrait, or square format.\n\nAs well as blog posts, you can create one-click videos for:\n\nFrequently asked questions\nCustomer reviews\nQuotes\nCase studies\nHow to guides\nCompany news\n\nYou can also make videos from scratch. Or, have AI Video Marketing Automator’s AI generate content from a prompt, such as a topic or product description.\n\nIf you’re investing hours of your time to create helpful content for your audience, you deserve to squeeze every last drop of value out of it. AI Video Marketing Automator lets you do it without having to invest significant time or resources.\n\nPrice\n\nYou can download AI Video Marketing Automator for free from the Semrush AppCenter.\n\nThe base subscription is $39 per month for five credits. This lets you create five videos a month.\n\nThere’s also a Pro Plan for $119 per month. This gives you an extra 40 credits, plus API access, bulk creation tools, and brand kits.\nYou can also choose to purchase an additional fifty credits for $149 per month.\n\n2. Brand24: Track Your Brand Mentions\n\nBrand24 is one of the most comprehensive AI-driven tools for online media monitoring. You can use it to monitor conversations about your brand across social media, blogs, news sites, review sites, podcasts, forums, and more.\n\nBut what sets Brand24 apart is the AI Brand Assistant. An AI-powered feature that analyzes your projects and gives you a summary of anything you want to know about your brand mentions.\n\nFor example, it can identify influencers for your niche, discover the context of discussions around your brand, or present customer insights.\n\nYou can also find out whether your mentions are positive, negative, or neutral with Brand24's sentiment analysis feature.\n\nIt generates a chart so you can see how many positive, negative, or neutral mentions you have over time.\n\nAnd a list of specific mentions, along with labels.\n\nYou can use Anomaly Detector to find sudden spikes in the number of brand mentions or your reach.\n\nThese features both help you simplify business reputation management. By summarizing and presenting data immediately.\n\nMeaning you no longer have spend time sifting through mentions to find out how people feel about your brand. Or to find the cause of a performance change.\n\nBut that’s not the end. Other important AI features include:\n\nAI Insights\nTopic Analysis\nMetric Analysis\nIntent Analysis\nPrice\n\nYou can test the tool for free for 14 days before choosing a paid subscription.\n\nBrand24 has four subscription plans:\n\nIndividual: $99 per month\nTeam: $179 per month\nPro: $249 per month\nEnterprise: $499 per month\n3. Google Assistant: Your Personal AI Assistant\n\nGoogle Assistant streamlines daily tasks such as managing your schedule or reading messages out loud. It also offers quick access to information, like the chance of rain in the next hour, so you can go about your day more efficiently.\n\nIf you own an Androidsmartphone, Google Home, or Wear OS device, you can activate Google Assistant with the touch of a button. Or turn on voice activation and start using it by saying, “Hey, Google.”\n\nOnce you do, Google’s artificial intelligence is ready to help you get things done in a natural, conversational way.\n\nSay you tell the AI assistant, “Hey, Google. Remember that I parked my car in Zone B.” Google will respond with something like, “Ok. I’ll remember that you parked your car in Zone B. I’ll also save a map of your location.”\n\nYou can use voice commands to ask Google Assistant to do anything you’d typically use your phone for. For example, you can:\n\nMake phone calls\nCheck the weather\nSend text messages\nSet an alarm\nFind the best route to a destination\nGet the latest news\n\nYou can also ask Google Assistant to send you meeting reminders, read out messages, and update you on upcoming appointments.\n\nIt’s all designed to keep you organized, as any good assistant should.\n\nAnd Google is rolling out a new feature to create an even more personalized helper.\n\nAssistant with Bard integrates Google’s chat-based AI tool Bard into the Assistant to extend its functionality to other Google tools, such as Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Drive.\n\nAssistant with Bard can scour your emails to find important information, write email replies, and create content.\n\nFor example, you can open the Assistant on a photo and ask it to write a social media post. Assistant with Bard uses the image as a visual cue to understand the context and create an engaging caption.\n\nImage Source: Google\n\nLike the current Google Assistant, Assistant with Bard is opt-in. So you can choose whether or not to use Bard’s capabilities.\n\nIf you do a lot of your business on your smartphone, Google Assistant is a powerful feature to increase your productivity.\n\nIf you’re not an Android or Google user, don’t feel left out.\n\nGoogle Assistant isn’t the only voice assistant in town. Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana all offer similar features. And are great options for your preferred phone, desktop, or smart home device.\n\nPrice\n\nGoogle Assistant is free with a Google Account.\n\n4. MarketingBlocks: Create Marketing Assets for Your Business\n\nMarketingBlocks eases the workload of content creation (and the potential cost of outsourcing) by generating human-like marketing assets from your keywords.\n\nIt’s powered by an AI assistant called Ethan.\n\nTell Ethan your business niche or product name and description. Then, choose what you want it to create for you.\n\nThe AI generates ready-to-use original marketing assets for your audience.\n\nEthan can create:\n\nWebsite copy\nAd copy\nLanding pages\nVideos\nEmails\nGraphics\nChatbots\nAnd plenty more\n\nYou can also use its AI to turn text into videos featuring real humans or avatars. Or ask Ethan to write and turn a script into audio for a podcast or audiobook.\n\nEssentially, if you need something for a marketing campaign, Ethan can probably take some of the ideation and generation off your plate.\n\nDoes it nail the brief every time?\n\nNot always.\n\nEthan creates content based on what it’s learned works for your keywords. But tone of voice, images, and graphics won’t always fit with your brand.\n\nSo, while Ethan can generate marketing assets for you, it’s important to check everything and make edits before sharing.\n\nBut to speed up content creation and keep your calendar full, MarketingBlocks is a great AI assistant.\n\nPrice\n\nMarketingBlocks has three plans:\n\nPro: $47 per month\nUnlimited: $67 per month\nEnterprise: $97 per month\n\nAll plans come with a five-day free trial.\n\n5. Semrush Copilot: Personalized SEO Insights\n\nSemrush Copilot is an intelligent AI assistant that provides a snapshot of your Semrush Project’s SEO performance as soon as you log in to your Semrush account. \n\nIts greatest benefit is the time it saves by identifying your website's weaknesses and presenting them directly to you, bypassing the need to comb through individual Semrush tools searching for shifts.\n\nHow does it achieve this?\n\nCopilot harnesses AI to work with the Semrush platform. It draws on vast amounts of data from Semrush databases, refined with input from leading SEO experts to power its AI algorithms. \n\nThen, you’ll get personalized recommendations, ideas, and templates tailored specifically for your project, thanks to an AI-driven recommendation system.\n\nTo leverage Copilot, you need to set up a project in Semrush. It then accesses the essential Semrush tools to provide your tailored SEO recommendations. \n\nTo follow up on Copilot’s suggestions, simply click the link to the corresponding tool in the bottom right corner. \n\nPrice\n\nSemrush Copilot is free with your Semrush account. However, you must set up projects within the platform to benefit from Copilot.\n\nFurther reading: Semrush Copilot: Your AI Assistant for Faster SEO Insights\n\n6. ChatGPT: Get Support with Everyday Work Tasks\n\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot that can help with a range of tasks, from writing content to simplifying complex ideas.\n\nGive ChatGPT a prompt and it uses its natural language processing (NLP) to provide a helpful, conversational response.\n\nFor example, you can ask ChatGPT to come up with content ideas for your marketing. Here, we’ve asked ChatGPT to generate five blog post ideas. These are the results:\n\nIf you’re not satisfied with the output, you can ask ChatGPT to regenerate the list. \n\nWhen you’ve found a result you’re happy with, you can ask follow-up questions to turn an idea into an outline.\n\nThat’s just one use case. There are all kinds of other scenarios where the tool can help, depending on your needs.\n\nChatGPT can assist with:\n\nMarket research: Ask Chat GPT to find competitors, gather publicly available data, or develop buyer personas.\nKeyword research: Ask Chat GPT to generate a list of unique terms related to your business.\nTranslation: Paste in your content and ask Chat GPT to rewrite it in a different language.\nEditing and proofreading: Paste in your content to spot typos, improve clarity, and suggest ways to make writing impactful.\nLearning new subjects: Ask Chat GPT to explain complex ideas in simple terms or give you the need-to-know information about a topic.\nWriting code: Ask Chat GPT to generate snippets of HTML, Python, PHP, C#, Java, or Javascript. Or have it create Excel spreadsheet formulas.\n\nTo get the most out of ChatGPT make prompts specific and detailed.\n\nFor example, if you want ChatGPT to write an email, give it details on your target audience, product, offer, and tone of voice.\n\nAnd don’t expect perfect results every time. Ask it to provide sources or revise answers where necessary. But accept that it won’t always be accurate.\n\nChatGPT is language-based, not experience based, so it cannot offer unique perspectives about a topic. So, it’s important to edit any content it generates before publishing.\n\nSimply put: use ChatGPT to assist you in your work, rather than to do it for you.\n\nPrice\n\nChat GPT is free. OpenAI also offers ChatGPT Plus, with benefits such as faster responses and priority access to new features for $20 per month.\n\nFurther reading: How to use ChatGPT: Your Step-by-Step Guide\n\n7. SEO Writing Assistant: Optimize Your Content to Improve Search Visibility\n\nSEO Writing Assistant (SWA) is trained to help you optimize your content to rank better in search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nIt uses AI and Semrush machine learning algorithms to improve content based on the top-ranking results for your target keywords.\n\nSo you can compete with the best of your competitors’ content.\n\nPaste your draft content or a URL to an existing page into SWA and you’ll get an overall score out of 10, as well as recommendations on how to improve.\n\nYou can also integrate the tool with Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or WordPress to get real-time suggestions as you work.\n\nSWA analyzes readability, originality, SEO, and tone of voice.\n\nIt also lets you enter keywords or pull keywords from the text. And suggests additions to make your content more search-engine friendly.\n\nOnce you have words in your document, you can access SWA’s AI features to:\n\nRephrase sentences\nSimplify text that’s difficult to read\nExpand thin content\nSummarize content for conclusions\n\nPlus, SWA comes with an Ask AI feature that’s similar to ChatGPT.\n\nGive Ask AI a prompt and it generates a response in your document.\n\nIt’s a powerful tool to build on an idea or add extra value to your content to boost search performance.\n\nPrice\n\nYou can use SEO Writing Assistant for free with a Semrush account.\n\nTo unlock additional features, you can sign up for a Guru subscription.\n\nThis gives you full access to SEO Writing Assistant, as well Topic Research and SEO Content Template, as part of Semrush’s Content Marketing Toolkit.\n\nThe Guru plan is $249.95 per month. Or, try it for free with a seven-day trial.\n\n8. ContentShake AI: Create Engaging Content from Scratch\n\nContentShake AI solves two common problems for marketers: coming up with ideas and finding the time to publish content consistently.\n\nThe tool uses AI to automate the entire content production process.

Motion will automatically shuffle your to-dos around so your day flows neatly.\n\nEach task is assigned a priority from “ASAP” to “Low,” which determines where it slots into your schedule.\n\nIf a task no longer fits into your day, the tool uses priorities to re-organize and bump less important jobs to the next day.\n\nIt means you’re never doing more than you can handle.\n\nMotion also lets you set hard or soft deadlines. These tell the tool how strict to be as the date approaches.\n\nIf you’re falling behind, you’ll get a warning for which deadlines you’re at risk of missing. You can then edit task details or speed up to get them done.\n\nBeyond your to-do list, Motion is a powerful project management tool that extends its functionality to your team.\n\nThis means each team member can have their own AI-optimized schedule. And teams can collaborate in an activity feed to share notes, subtasks, and comments to improve workflows.\n\nPlus, you can view activity and schedule tasks from a single calendar.

Otter.ai is the best AI assistant for keeping you in the loop.\n\nOtter.ai uses AI to transcribe meetings in real time for Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet calls. So, you have notes and key takeaways for each session.\n\nIt can also automatically capture slides and add them to notes for context.\n\nThis can be a lifesaver for anyone who’s ever had to transcribe or take notes during a meeting.\n\nBut what we love most about Otter is its artificial intelligence meeting “participant.”\n\nOtterPilot is built to enhance user experience. Its conversational AI is capable of answering questions and generating content from meeting talking points.\n\nSay you join a sales meeting that’s already in progress. You can ask OtterPilot to get up to speed.\n\nTo use the example in the below image: “I just joined. What drove the Q1 record sales?”\n\nThe chatbot uses context from the real-time transcription to instantly provide an answer.\n\nTeammates can also join in the conversion to ask follow-up questions, or chat together and with OtterPilot.\n\nAfter a meeting, you can ask OtterPilot to summarize key points or tasks. Or generate further content.\n\nFor example, you can prompt it to write a thank-you email to meeting attendees and copy it to send.\n\nIn short, OtterPilot means you don’t have to be present in a meeting to get the most out of it. And we could all do with that option from time to time.\n\nPrice\n\nOtter.ai has a Basic free plan with limited use for individual users and three paid plans:\n\nPro: $10 per user, per month\nBusiness: $20 per user, per month\nEnterprise: Priced around your needs\n14.

Or, make quick edits to highlight key information and adapt the content to suit your story.\n\nYou can also ask DesignerBot to generate art based on a prompt. Then, drag and drop the image anywhere in a slide.\n\nAs with ChatGPT (or any AI virtual assistant), it pays to be specific and detailed.\n\nBeautiful.ai’s Context AI feature lets you add additional information to give DesignerBot more context, so it can produce better results.\n\nIf you need anything more than a basic framework of a deck, add as much context as possible.\n\nSay you want to create a presentation on developing a brand positioning strategy.\n\nAfter entering your prompt, you can select “Train AI with Additional Content” and upload a positioning strategy blog post or study.\n\nDesignerBot uses this information, along with its training data, to produce an 8-12 slide deck (DesignerBot is limited to 12 slides).\n\nThe more data you can provide, the less time you’ll spend making edits.
