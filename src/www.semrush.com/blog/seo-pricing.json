  "title": "SEO Pricing: What Does SEO Cost & What Affects It?",
  "content": "SEO pricing for external experts ranges from hardly anything to thousands of dollars each month.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause each company has unique goals and needs. And each SEO provider has their own pricing packages and models.\n\nUnderstanding SEO pricing and the factors that affect those costs will help you make decisions that align with your marketing budget and business goals. So, we created this SEO pricing guide for you.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nIs SEO Free? \n\nOrganic (unpaid) placement on search engine results pages (SERPs) is free in that Google doesn't charge for them.\n\nBut it takes experienced professionals to do things like create high-quality content. And implement schema markup—code that helps search engines understand what your pages are about and can lead to special search results like this:\n\nIn short, they know what can lead to better rankings (higher placement in search results) and more traffic. And which tactics they should avoid to lower the chances of ranking losses.\n\nFor these reasons and more, SEO specialists, content marketers, SEO freelancers, and other experts can be costly.\n\nAnd allowing someone who isn't a legitimate SEO professional to work on your website to save a little money could be detrimental to your search rankings, organic traffic, and conversion rates—and cost you significantly more in the long run.\n\nWhat Are Some General SEO Pricing Benchmarks?\n\nWe’ll get into the specifics that affect SEO prices later. But here are some figures you can reference, based on a survey of nearly 400 respondents that do SEO for clients:\n\nSEO agencies around the world charge $134.14 per hour on average\nSEO agencies in the U.S. charge $147.93 per hour on average\nSEO consultants around the world charge $139.29 per hour on average\nSEO consultants in the U.S. charge $144.68 per hour on average\nHalf of SEO providers around the world require a monthly retainer of less than $3,000 per month\nWhat Are SEO Prices Based on?\n\nHere are the key factors that will affect your SEO prices:\n\nWhether You Do Anything Yourself\n\nWorking with an external expert (or experts) is common. But there are many SEO tasks you can do yourself—so long as you have the right tools.\n\nFor example, the Keyword Magic Tool makes it easy to find relevant search terms to focus on when creating and updating webpages.\n\nGo to the tool, enter a broad term related to your niche, and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll get a bunch of related keywords and information for each. \n\nNext, it’s best to narrow down this list to find ones that are more specific. Which you can do by using the suggested groups and subgroups on the left to filter the results.\n\nLook for ones that are highly relevant. And consider the “Volume” column (how many times the term is searched each month) and the “KD %” (a metric called keyword difficulty that indicates how hard it is to rank highly for the term).\n\nDoing this will help you prioritize options that you can reasonably rank for and that will drive traffic to your site.\n\nYou can incorporate these keywords into your content yourself. Or work with an SEO provider to do it.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nThe SEO Provider You Choose\n\nSEO agencies often have more resources and a team of people to handle all aspects of your project. They can also offer bespoke options unique to your business.\n\nBut agency prices are often high. Operating costs like rent for an office space and salaries for staff mean they have to charge more to cover those base costs.\n\nAnd you don’t typically get a very personal experience with an agency. Most of the time, you won't deal directly with the SEO experts who are working on your site. Instead, you'll work with an account manager or other point person.\n\nIf you're looking for a more personal experience, you may prefer to hire a freelance SEO consultant. You'll deal directly with the expert working on your site and be more involved in the process.\n\nThe downside when working with a freelance consultant is it can be difficult to scale services. And you can’t usually find a single person who can help with all your SEO needs.\n\nTip\n\nFind the right SEO agency with Semrush Agency Partners. Just provide information about your business and service needs to get matched with experts.\n \n\nYour Provider's Location\n\nAgencies and freelancers based in areas with higher costs of living may charge higher fees to cover their expenses.\n\nOn the other hand, providers located in regions with lower costs of living can offer more competitive pricing.\n\nAnd remember that the agency’s location can make a big difference if you’re planning to do local SEO. Because they may have greater knowledge of relevant areas.\n\nYour Provider's Experience\n\nExperienced SEO agencies with a proven track record of successful campaigns, authoritative case studies, and deep industry knowledge will typically charge higher fees.\n\nIndividual consultants who are considered influencers in the industry may charge more than other freelancers. And in some cases, more than agencies. \n\nThis is something to keep in mind when an appealingly low price catches your eye.\n\nYes, freelance hiring sites like Upwork let you set a budget as low as $5. But it often means the provider doesn’t yet have years of expertise guiding them.\n\nThe Specifics of Your Business\n\nSEO pricing can depend on the size of your business, the industry you operate in, and even things like the competitiveness of your target keywords.\n\nFor example, small businesses looking to compete against well-known brands often require more extensive SEO efforts to stand out from the crowd.\n\nBut it's important to note that SEO is a long-term process, and it may take several months to start seeing significant results. So, consider the ongoing costs and commitment required to improve and maintain your organic search visibility.\n\nThe Services You Need\n\nThe specific SEO services you need can dramatically impact your costs.\n\nFor example, a link building campaign will likely cost far less than a thorough SEO audit coupled with technical optimizations.\n\nHere’s an overview of the types of SEO activities you can outsource:\n\nOn-Page SEO \n\nOn-page SEO is about improving various elements on your webpages to improve their search engine visibility.\n\nThis includes actions such as:\n\nKeyword research\nMeta tag optimization (improving bits of HTML code that help search engines and people better understand your content)\nURL structure optimization\nContent optimization\nInternal linking (linking to your own pages from other pages on your site)\nTechnical SEO \n\nTechnical SEO involves improving technical aspects of your website, mainly to enhance its crawlability and indexability (making it easier for search engines to find your content and store it in a database).\n\nServices can include:\n\nWebsite audits\nSite speed optimization\nHreflang attribute implementation (adding HTML that specifies a page’s language and target location)\nWebsite migrations\nXML sitemap creation (making a file that lists all the important pages you want search engines to crawl and index)\nContent Creation\n\nContent creation is an integral part of any SEO strategy. Without content, there's nothing to rank and nothing to bring traffic to.\n\nContent creation also involves keyword optimization and ensuring the content aligns with your target audience's search intent (the purpose behind a searcher’s query).\n\nCosts for content creation are based on factors like the creator’s expertise, how many editing phases there are, and much more.\n\nIt also depends on the format, which can include the following:\n\nBlog posts\nVideos\nEbooks\nPodcast episodes\nInfographics\n\nTip\n\nIf you want to start creating content sooner rather than later, use SEO Writing Assistant. It has AI features that help with writing and also checks your content for SEO, tone of voice, readability, and originality.\n\nQuickly Create and Review Content\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign up Now →\nLink Building\n\nLink building is the process of acquiring high-quality links from reputable websites. Getting backlinks like this can improve your website's authority and rankings in search results.\n\nLink-building services often include:\n\nCreating linkable assets\nOutreach to relevant websites\nGuest posting\nBuilding relationships with influencers and journalists\nSkyscraper link building (creating and sharing the best content on the target topic)\n\nTip\n\nDoing link building yourself is easy with the Link Building Tool. Just set up a project to find prospects, send outreach emails, and manage your progress all within the tool.\n\nSecure Valuable Backlinks\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nLocal SEO\n\nLocal SEO focuses on optimizing your online presence to increase visibility among nearby audiences. Which is particularly important if your business has physical locations.\n\nIt includes activities such as:\n\nGetting local directory listings\nManaging online reviews\nFinding local keywords\nGetting backlinks from other local businesses\nOptimizing your Google Business Profile (which can appear in search results)\nThe Model You Select\n\nThe SEO service model you opt for plays a huge part in determining your exact costs. \n\nLet’s go over your options:\n\nProject-Based SEO Pricing\n\nMany agencies and freelancers offer a flat fee for specific projects, such as website audits or content optimization.\n\nThe cost of these projects varies depending on their complexity and the time required to complete them. \n\nUsually, the provider will go through your SEO goals and give you a project quote based on the size of the project and the expected results. They should also let you know whether there are any circumstances where you may be charged additional fees. \n\nMonthly Retainers\n\nSome SEO agencies use a monthly retainer model. This means you pay for ongoing SEO services each month.\n\nCosts can vary greatly depending on the services included and your desired outcomes.\n\nSome options combine SEO with paid media and public relations services. To help you manage all aspects of your marketing strategy.\n\nThis is a good option if you have lofty goals and want to take a hands-off approach.\n\nHourly Rates\n\nSome SEO agencies or freelance consultants charge for their services on an hourly basis. \n\nThis can help you control costs because you can limit the number of hours worked on your project.\n\nJust know that you may end up purchasing more hours than you planned to. Because many SEO tasks take a considerable amount of time.\n\nPerformance-Based SEO Pricing\n\nSome SEO agencies and freelancers offer a performance-based pricing model. \n\nThis is where the fee is tied to specific outcomes like meeting concrete key performance indicators (KPIs). SEO KPIs can include keyword rankings, organic traffic growth, and conversions.\n\nKeep Your SEO Costs in Check\n\nYou may need help with technical SEO like adding schema markup or reworking your site architecture. But you can stay within budget by going the DIY SEO route for some things.\n\nSemrush enables you to easily do many SEO tasks with tools like:\n\nKeyword Magic Tool: Conduct keyword research to find search terms to use on your site\nSEO Writing Assistant: Create SEO-optimized content with the help of AI\nLink Building Tool: Manage your link building efforts from start to finish\n\nAnd more.\n\nYou can even get started with a Semrush account for free.\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
