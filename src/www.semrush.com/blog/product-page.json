  "content": "Product pages are webpages designed to sell products online. They typically include an image, description, price, and “Add to Cart” button.\n\nBut a lot more strategy goes into the best product pages.\n\nCheck out 17 inspiring product page examples (in no particular order). We’ve included top brands like Amazon, Apple, and Nike so you can learn what the best ecommerce websites do.\n\nThen, learn how to implement best practices in your own designs.\n\n1. Amazon // Provide In-Depth Information\n\nAmazon is the most visited ecommerce site in the U.S. Its product page design isn’t pretty, but it works.\n\nIn this example, a descriptive product name highlights key features. Helping the page stand out and attract clicks in search results.\n\nNote: Selling products through Amazon? Semrush’s Amazon marketing tools can increase your listings’ visibility and conversions.\n\nThe average star rating and number of ratings are prominently placed. Amazon understands these metrics are crucial for building trust. \n\n(In a U.S. survey, 98% of respondents said reviews are an essential resource when making purchasing decisions.)\n\nImages show product benefits in action. While overlay text provides context.\n\nHere are some other beneficial features you’ll find on this product page:\n\n“#1 Best Seller” label to evoke fear of missing out (FOMO) in shoppers\nSustainability information to reassure eco-conscious consumers\nReview videos from third-party creators such as Pocket Lint\nSkimmable list of key product benefits\nFull breakdown of product specifications\nCustomer questions and answers\nComparison table featuring other models\nLinks to related products\n\nKey takeaway: Amazon’s busy product page design won’t work for every product website. But it shows that consumers are eager for information. Test various formats to cater to your ideal shoppers.\n\n2. Apple // Direct Shoppers to the Checkout\n\nApple is known for its sleek, minimalist aesthetic. Its product page designs are no different.\n\nConsider the iPhone 14 Pro product page. The clean design puts the product photo front and center. And directs shoppers to make their selections.\n\nRather than having separate pages for each model, color, and storage combination, Apple brings all the options together in one place. To improve the user experience (UX) and make shopping easier.\n\nNotice the emphasis on pricing: Apple has other landing pages focused on the product’s benefits and specifications. This one is tailored to people who are ready to buy.\n\nThe “New” label at the top capitalizes on people’s desire to snag the latest model. \n\nLive chat allows the company to answer questions quickly. Reducing the risk of customers leaving at this crucial stage.\n\nKey takeaway: Direct your users’ attention to the next step. Whether it’s adding a product to their basket or making a color selection.\n\n3. Gymshark // Keep Users On the Page\n\nOne of the biggest issues with buying fashion online? You can’t try on the outfits.\n\nGymshark provides a variety of model photos to help shoppers visualize clothing on themselves. Making sure to cover every color variant.\n\nPlus, an interactive size guide helps shoppers find the perfect fit.\n\nAlthough the “Add to Bag” button stands out most on this product page, there’s also an “Add to Wishlist” option. This accommodates shoppers who want to shortlist items or purchase later. Meaning they’re less likely to forget about something that piqued their interest.\n\nGymshark could even send these users an email reminder.\n\nKey takeaway: Provide all the information shoppers might need right on your product page. Don’t direct them elsewhere and disrupt their journey.\n\n4. Leesa // Build Trust with Reviews\n\nOnline shoppers can’t lie on a mattress to see how it feels.\n\nEcommerce brand Leesa navigates this issue through copywriting. For example, it says the product “adapts to your shape” and sells benefits such as “restorative rest.”\n\nSocial proof is important, too. Leesa prominently displays customer reviews and industry accolades on or near the main product photo. To reassure shoppers they’re making a smart purchase.\n\nThe product page also advertises a $200 discount and monthly payment option. Making the large price tag seem more manageable.\n\nKey takeaway: Customer reviews and industry accolades can build trust and convince customers to buy.\n\n5. Anova // Speak to Your Target Audience\n\nAnova’s precision cooker is aimed at cooking enthusiasts. And the main product photo makes this clear upfront.\n\nThe company also uses phrases like “fine dining” and “cooking like a pro” to engage their target audience.\n\nFurther down the product page, highlighted features with supporting lifestyle images help shoppers visualize the product in their own kitchens. \n\nNotice how the “Add to cart” button follows users down the page. Users don’t have to scroll back up once they’ve decided to buy.\n\nKey takeaway: Tailor your product page to your target audience’s desires and pain points.\n\n6. The Ordinary // Make Information More Engaging\n\nThe Ordinary’s scientific approach to skin care is reflected in its product page design. The spacious, white layout is reminiscent of a laboratory. While an emphasis on ingredients lends extra authority.\n\nFurther down the page, reference to a clinical study provides a level of credibility that’s valuable in the skin care industry. \n\nAnd this table enables shoppers to digest key information quickly:\n\nThe Ordinary educates shoppers on using the product in its “How to build a skin regimen” section. This also allows the brand to promote related products.\n\nKey takeaway: Creative design allows you to present information in digestible and engaging ways. \n\n7. Boohoo // Ensure Key Elements Stand Out\n\nNotice how much the product price and “20% Off Everything” banner stand out on this Boohoo product page.\n\nThe online fashion brand is known for its sales and discounts. And it’s not afraid to emphasize them. It also offers a variety of pay-later options to convert budget-conscious shoppers.\n\nAlthough Boohoo is a fast-fashion brand with constantly rotating stock, it invests in high-quality product photography. Complete with modeling. Because it recognizes that aesthetics are a customer priority.\n\nThe “Looking for something similar?” section provides recommendations if the shopper’s size is out of stock or the design isn’t quite right. Increasing the chance of conversion.\n\nKey takeaway: When you step back from your product page design, the most important elements should stand out immediately.\n\n8. Kombu // Dare to Be Bold\n\nBeverage company Kombu’s bold design proves you can ditch the standard product page layout.\n\nKombu visitors have likely already tasted the drink and want to order in bulk. So there’s no need to “sell” the product through elaborate descriptions and lifestyle images. \n\nThe company can focus on delivering a unique UX. One that strengthens the brand image and keeps shoppers returning.\n\nKey takeaway: Dare to be bold and do something that stands out if your brand allows for it.\n\n9. Target // Add User-Generated Content\n\nTarget provides clear stock information and delivery estimates to help shoppers choose between fulfillment options.\n\nIts product pages also capitalize on user-generated content. When leaving a review, Target customers can do the following:\n\nProvide specific ratings for comfort, value, and style\nLet future shoppers know whether an item runs true to size\nShare their own photos\n\nTarget customers (alongside staff) can also answer user questions. \n\nThis builds trust and presents the consumer with ample information throughout the purchasing journey.\n\nKey takeaway: Build trust by adding user-generated content. \n\n10. Barner // Replicate In-Store Experiences\n\nBarner uses a variety of product photos and an animated GIF to give shoppers a holistic view of its glasses.\n\nThen, interested shoppers can use the “Virtual Try On” feature to recreate the in-store experience. This creative approach can help the brand maximize sales and minimize returns.\n\nBarner also uses a couple of interesting upselling tactics in this product page example:\n\nMinimum purchase for free shipping\nMultipurchase discounts \n\nKey takeaway: Think about in-store shopping and upsell experiences. And consider how they can translate to your product website.\n\n11. Silver Cross // Resolve Audience Objections\n\nExpectant parents have many questions when buying a stroller. Silver Cross works to answer them in this product page description.\n\nMost of that information happens above the fold (at the top of the page, before the user scrolls). Which works to quickly capture the audience’s attention.\n\nThen, the company focuses visitors’ attention on the next step. The “BUY NOW” button features a high-contrast color and follows the user down the page.\n\nKey takeaway: Resolve your audience’s objections within your product page descriptions. Address questions that might otherwise hold them back from purchasing.\n\n12. Garmin // Prioritize Above the Fold\n\nMany people research big-brand products on third-party blogs, review sites, and other sources. By the time they reach the product page, they’re ready to start the transaction.\n\nThat’s why Garmin’s product page focuses on elements like price, size, and color—things that matter toward the end of the buying journey.\n\nBut indecisive shoppers aren’t left behind. Specifications, box contents, and compatible devices are listed below the fold. Along with other useful information.\n\nKey takeaway: Consider the inverted pyramid approach for your product pages. Start with the most essential information above the fold; then provide more detail below. \n\n13. REI // Provide Great Mobile UX\n\nREI has the best product pages for mobile UX, according to research firm Baymard Institute.\n\nHere are some reasons it scored well:\n\nCollapsible sections prevent unnecessary scrolling\nCross-sell (i.e., “People also viewed”) sections are placed at the end\nProduct variations are linked\nProduct videos are presented as part of the image gallery\nProduct prices are highly visible\n\nKey takeaway: Many consumers use smartphones to shop online. So your product pages need to look and work great on mobile screens.\n\n14. Zara // Get Creative\n\nZara’s online store has short product descriptions. It lets dramatic images do the talking.\n\nUnusual model poses help the brand capture online shoppers’ attention. And give their products a high-fashion feel.\n\nThis approach has even earned Zara some free publicity.\n\nKey takeaway: If you have limited flexibility with your product page layout, try a creative approach with other elements. Such as photos or text.\n\n15. Firebox // Create a Sense of Urgency\n\nFirebox is a place for users to “shop for the unusual.” Photos and videos show its products in action, helping shoppers see the functionality of its quirky gifts.\n\nPlus, the site’s humorous copywriting perfectly complements its novelty products.\n\nFirebox product pages highlight stock levels to create a sense of urgency. This can encourage more shoppers to head to the checkout.\n\nKey takeaway: Consider notifying online shoppers of low stock levels. This can encourage conversions. And avoid disappointment when items sell out unexpectedly.\n\n16. Dyson // Highlight USPs\n\nDyson’s product pages work to convince shoppers to buy direct rather than through third-party retailers.\n\nThe “Buy direct from the people who made it” section builds trust. And loyalty. It also draws attention to unique selling propositions (USPs), such as free next-day delivery and a money-back guarantee.\n\nPlus, the brand’s commitment to efficient design is reflected in its product pages. For example, this product specification layout is clear and attractive.\n\nThis reseller, on the other hand, displays the same specifications in a less appealing way:\n\nKey takeaway: When your products are available elsewhere, it’s crucial to highlight USPs. And deliver a standout UX.\n\n17. Nike // Promote Related Products\n\nVisuals dominate Nike’s product pages. Up-close product photos showcase details and material types. Model shots give styling inspiration. And user-generated content complements the aesthetic of the page.\n\nA “Complete the Look” section helps shoppers visualize the product in their wardrobes and encourages them to browse other items on the site.\n\nKey takeaway: Promoting related items on your product pages can help you increase average order value (AOV).\n\nProduct Page Best Practices\n\nProduct page design can make or break your online store.\n\nEcommerce marketing comprises countless tactics to drive traffic to your product pages. But these efforts are useless if your pages don’t convert. \n\nBelow are nine product page best practices that turn more visitors into customers (i.e., improve your conversion rate). To help you create some of the best product pages out there.\n\nStay on Brand\n\nYour product page design should align with your brand identity—i.e., the personality you want to portray. This will help you engage your target customer and generate repeat business.\n\nFor example, creativity and fun are among Lego’s brand values. So its product pages are colorful, whimsical, and inspiring.\n\nBrand identity can impact everything from your layout to individual word choices. If you need inspiration, look at product page examples from brands you admire. How do they make their personality apparent?\n\nTip: Learn how to define your brand’s tone of voice with our guide. This is one of the key steps toward building your brand identity and writing copy that converts.\n\nOptimize Product Names and Descriptions\n\nEvery product needs a unique and descriptive name. Include this name in the product page’s title (also known as the H1 tag). \n\nAs well as the page’s title tag (the title that appears in search engine results).\n\nThis helps ensure your product ranks highly in relevant search results. And attracts clicks from target shoppers.\n\nYou should also write an SEO-friendly product description that includes your product name. But it’s more important to focus on persuading customers to convert. \n\nProvide all the details someone might need to make a purchase decision. And tackle objections that might otherwise cause them to leave the page. \n\nDeliver a Quality User Experience\n\nThe best product websites deliver high-quality UX on every device: desktop, tablet, and mobile.\n\nThis means their product pages:\n\nLoad quickly\nAre visually appealing \nUse HTTPS security\nMake it easy to “add to cart”\nProvide useful and accurate information\nHave a clear and easy-to-navigate layout\nUse clever formatting to make information digestible\n\nThink about the last time you made a purchase online. What went smoothly? What could have been better? Your personal experiences can help you design a better shopping experience for your end user.\n\nTip: Run your product page URL through Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool for tips on decreasing your page’s loading time. Or use Semrush’s Site Audit tool for help identifying, prioritizing, and fixing technical issues across your site.\n\nFind and Fix Technical Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nAdd a Clear Call-to-Action Button\n\nProduct page design is all about getting the user to click “buy.” So it’s crucial for the call-to-action (CTA) button to stand out.\n\nMost product websites use an eye-catching background color. And straightforward CTA text, such as “Add to Cart” or “Buy Now.”\n\nPlace the button near the top of the screen. Ideally above the fold, so shoppers don’t have to scroll once they’re ready to buy.\n\nProvide High-Quality Visuals \n\nHigh-quality photos make your products more desirable and help customers understand exactly what they’re getting. They put your products in their best light without being misleading.\n\nProvide large, clear photos shot against blank backgrounds. Making sure to cover different angles and features. You could even use spin photography to provide an interactive 360-degree view.\n\nLifestyle shots show your product in action. And help shoppers visualize the product in their own lives. \n\nThis Ikea product page ticks all the boxes:\n\nTip: Need to demonstrate complex product features? Try using custom graphics, animated images, or videos.\n\nDisplay Clear Pricing and Shipping Information\n\nProduct page visitors are often in the conversion stage of the marketing funnel—i.e., they’re ready to buy. So it’s important to provide clear pricing and shipping information upfront.\n\nHere are some top tips:\n\nDisplay the product price prominently\nHighlight any discounts or promotions\nAdvertise convenient payment options, such as Klarna or Google Pay\nProvide delivery estimates and prices\n\nAvoid sending shoppers to other pages (e.g., /shipping-faqs/) for information. This can disrupt the buying process and lead to lost sales.\n\nBuild Trust with Ratings and Reviews\n\nThe best product page examples provide customer ratings and reviews. To help shoppers decide whether to buy your product. And whether to buy from you.\n\nSo, ask for your customers’ feedback. Then display it prominently. \n\nThis could include an average star rating at the top of the page. And individual reviews at the bottom, complete with images, comments, and ratings breakdowns.\n\nMake sure you can reply to reviews, where necessary. This will help you resolve any complaints and protect your brand reputation. Like Frigidaire does here: \n\nTip: Instill confidence in your customers by advertising any accreditations, accolades, or customer service perks. Let shoppers know your product website is trustworthy.\n\nUse Structured Data\n\nStructured data is information that helps search engines understand webpages better. It uses a markup language called schema.\n\nWith product schema, you can tag the following elements on your product pages:\n\nAverage rating\nImage\nColor\nPrice\nAnd more\n\nThis can help you secure rich results in Google, which are more detailed and engaging listings. \n\nLike this one from Walmart:\n\nThis rich result can help Walmart stand out on the results page and attract more clicks from Google.\n\nTip: Google offers a Structured Data Markup Helper that can help you apply schema to your product pages.\n\nMake Improvements with Split Testing\n\nThe best product pages are often the result of extensive split testing, also known as A/B testing.\n\nIt works like this:\n\nMake a small adjustment to your page, such as changing the color of the “Add to Cart” button\nServe the new version of the page to half of your site visitors, and the old version of the page to the other half\nAfter a set period of time, analyze key metrics to see which version performed better\nApply changes that work and ignore ones that don’t \n\nThis data-led approach to product page design helps you identify, test, and apply changes quickly and efficiently. \n\nTip: With the SplitSignal tool, accurately test how product page changes impact your organic traffic (i.e., unpaid visits from search engines). Without the need for complex development and data analysis work.\n\nImprove Product Page Traffic\n\nwith A/B Testing on SplitSignal\n\nLearn More →\nGet Expert Help with Product Pages\n\nThese product page examples and best practices offer plenty of ideas.
