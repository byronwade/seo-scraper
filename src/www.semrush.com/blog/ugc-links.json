  "content": "User-generated content links, or UGC links, are hyperlinks found in customer reviews, blog comments, and other types of content created by visitors or random users.\n\nIf your site allows visitors to post content, add the UGC attribute (rel=ugc) to the links they share. So Google knows you’re not responsible for the content of the linked pages. \n\nHere’s how and when to use the UGC link attribute—and why it matters. \n\nWhat Is a UGC Link Attribute? (rel=“UGC”)\n\nThe UGC link attribute (rel=“UGC”) is an HTML value that indicates a specific link is user-generated. Which means you didn’t create the link. And aren’t vouching for the page it points to.\n\nTelling Google that a link is user-generated is important because Google sees links as a vote of confidence. And linking to poor-quality sites can hurt your search engine rankings.\n\nIn your website’s code, the UGC link attribute looks like this:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com/\" rel=\"ugc\">Link text</a>\n\nBy comparison, a plain link has the following structure:\n\n<a href=\"https://yourwebsite.com\">Link text</a>\n\nOther link attributes include “nofollow” (rel=”nofollow”) and sponsored (rel=”sponsored”). \n\nSimilar to the UGC link attribute, the other two link attributes also help Google understand more about the links in your content.\n\nThe “nofollow” link attribute tells Google you don’t want your site associated with or connected to the linked domain.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://yourwebsite.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link text</a>\n\nThe “sponsored” link attribute tells Google the link is part of an ad, sponsorship, or other arrangement the website owner was paid to place.\n\nThe “sponsored” tag looks like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://yourwebsite.com\" rel=\"sponsored\">Link text</a>\nHow Does the UGC Attribute Affect SEO?\n\nThe UGC attribute doesn’t have a huge impact on search rankings. \n\nWhen a website links to another, it passes authority to the linked page, which can boost that page’s search engine rankings. \n\nUnless the link contains the rel=\"ugc,\" rel=\"sponsored,\" or \"rel=\"nofollow\" attribute. Then, the link is unlikely to pass on an SEO benefit. \n\nHowever, Google now treats link attributes as hints. Which means Google may consider a UGC link within its search ranking systems.\n\nGoogle has also said that it analyzes these attributes to detect patterns of unnatural or spammy links.\n\nFor example, some webmasters leave spam comments on forums and blogs—along with a link back to their sites. Their goal is to manipulate search engines and generate more traffic.\n\nLink in this example below:\n\nIn some cases, UGC links can indirectly impact SEO. For instance, relevant UGC links from authoritative sources (e.g., a CNET product review) to your site may increase traffic and engagement.\n\nAnd linking to spammy websites may harm your SEO efforts. So, if your website allows user-generated links in comments, articles, or customer reviews, be sure to add the UGC link attribute. \n\n(Many website comment platforms will automatically add a UGC attribute to links within user-submitted comments. Or will provide an option to do so.)\n\nFurther reading: Types of Backlinks: Which Ones Help Your Website?\n\nHow to Find the UGC Links Pointing to a Website\n\nQuickly find UGC links with Semrush's Backlink Analytics tool. This information may come in handy when you're researching your competitors or a domain you want to buy.\n\nA domain with lots of UGC links from irrelevant or questionable sites may engage in spammy activities. So you might think twice before purchasing it.\n\nTo find UGC links, enter a domain name (yours or your competitors’) into Backlink Analytics. And click \"Analyze.\"\n\nSemrush will scan that domain and the links pointing to it, otherwise known as backlinks or inbound links. \n\nAnd then generate an overview that includes the website’s link profile, organic traffic, top pages, and other data.\n\nNext, click the \"Backlinks\" tab.\n\nThe tool will take you to a new page displaying all the links pointing to that domain. From here, you can sort and filter them by status (\"Active,\" \"New,\" or \"Lost\"), attribute, placement, and other criteria.\n\nGo to the graph labeled \"Link Attributes,\" and then click on the bar or number beside \"UGC.\"\n\nSemrush will display all the UGC links pointing to that website.\n\nThis data can provide insight into your competitors. For instance, you can see if there's a way to get UGC links from the websites linking to them.\n\nHow to Use Link Attributes\n\nAll three link attributes—UGC, sponsored, and nofollow—serve a different purpose. Each communicates to Google what kind of link appears on your page.\n\nAnd give Google some “hints” about how to treat that link.\n\nSometimes, you don’t need to use a link attribute. If you want to pass authority to another page on your site, for example, you can skip the link attribute.\n\nHere's how to use these link attributes to help Google understand your content better.\n\nAutomatically Add the UGC Link Attribute to Comments and Reviews\n\nIf your site runs on WordPress, you can use plugins to automatically add the rel=\"ugc” attribute to comments and reviews left by visitors. Here are some plugins that work well:\n\nAll in One SEO (AIOSEO)\nUGC Comments\nWP External Links\n\nSay your website allows visitors to create and publish content such as reviews. \n\nUse AIOSEO to add the UGC attribute to the links they include in their posts. Like this:\n\nAlso, install the UGC Comments plugin to automatically add rel=\"ugc” to the comments left by visitors: \n\nNow open any page (on your site) that has comments from users. \n\nRight-click on the page and select “View page source.” \n\nIf there are any links in those comments, they’ll have the UGC attribute. \n\nAdd Sponsored Links to Paid External Links (rel=\"sponsored\")\n\nAdd the \"sponsored\" tag to any links pointing to sites that paid you to link to them.\n\nLet's say a company paid you to link to their newest product in your next blog post. Use rel=“sponsored” every time you link to that product to tell search engines that they paid you to mention them.\n\nThe link would look like this:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com/\" rel=\"sponsored\">Link text</a>\n\nDo the same when linking to other websites in sponsored reviews, advertisements, or affiliate blog posts.\n\nSemrush's Backlink Analytics allows you to check a website's sponsored links.\n\nDoing so will give you a better idea of your competitor's messaging and offers. And their partnerships with influencers, brands, or other third-party products. \n\nSimply add a domain name, and then go to the \"Backlinks\" tab.\n\nNext, click \"Sponsored\" from the filtering menu to see the sponsored links pointing to that domain.\n\nClick the \"Active\" tab to exclude any lost links from the results.\n\nFor example, MyProtein has around 2,300 sponsored links. Including two from a product roundup featured in The Telegraph.\n\nIf you’re in the protein drink space, you might want to contact The Telegraph to place a sponsored link, too.\n\nLikewise, you can use Backlink Analytics to check the sponsored links pointing to your domain.\n\nThis way, you can see if your partners hold to their part of the deal and link to your brand or products as agreed.\n\nFurther reading: Sponsored Content: The Ultimate Guide with Inspiring Examples \n\nAdd the Nofollow Attribute to Content You Don’t Vouch For (rel=\"nofollow\")\n\nAdd rel=\"nofollow\" to any links you don't want Google to associate with your website. These may include:\n\nUGC links\nSponsored links\nLow-quality links\nUnapproved links\n\nHere's an example of a nofollow link:\n\n<a href=\"https://yourwebsite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link text</a>\n\nThe nofollow attribute is catch-all. And you can add it to any links you don’t vouch for. Including UGC links. \n\nAgain, you can use Backlink Analytics to find the nofollow links for your website or other sites.\n\nThis time, click the \"Nofollow\" and \"Active\" tabs.\n\nFor instance, MyProtein has a nofollow link from Muscle & Fitness.\n\nMuscle & Fitness has an article about the best and worst whey protein powders. And mentions MyProtein's Impact Whey as one of its top picks.\n\nThe nofollow link comes in the form of a clickable product image that takes you to the brand's product page.\n\nNofollow links are unlikely to directly impact your search engine rankings. But they can increase website traffic. As more people discover your content, you may see higher engagement and revenue.\n\nWith that in mind, use Semrush's Backlink Analytics to see who's linking to your competitors. Some websites may agree to link to your pages, even if they'll add the nofollow tag.\n\nDon’t Use an Attribute for Content You Vouch For\n\nDofollow links (often simply called “follow” links) are hyperlinks without any attributes. By using them, you tell Google that you trust the linked page.\n\nHere's an example of a follow link pointing from another website to yours:\n\n<a href=\"https://yourwebsite.com/\">Link text</a>\n\nThese types of links pass on authority, or “link juice,” to the pages they point to. Therefore, they can boost your website’s search engine results. \n\nLet's imagine you quote some industry experts in one of your posts. Since you trust their information, it's OK to add follow links to their pages.\n\nSimilarly, you can include follow links to peer-reviewed journals, unbiased reviews, government agencies, or other trustworthy sources.\n\nFind follow links with Semrush’s Backlink Analytics. Knowing how many links you (or your competitors) have can be useful for PR campaigns, competitor research, or brand monitoring.\n\nFirst, enter the domain name you want to analyze. After that, click the \"Backlinks\" tab.\n\nNext, scroll down to the “Backlinks” section and select \"Follow\" from the filtering menu. Click the \"Active\" tab, too.\n\nThen, check the follow links pointing to that domain. \n\nFor instance, skincare brand Paula's Choice has about 1.8 million follow links from USA Today, The New York Times, Healthline, and other sources.\n\nClick on the arrow symbol next to a link to open the source of the backlink.\n\nClicking the arrow symbol in the image above will open a Northwestern Medicine article about skincare. With a link to a blog post by Paula’s Choice.\n\nHaving a mix of follow and nofollow links to your site creates a natural backlink profile. As opposed to a spammy one. \n\nUse Multiple Attributes to Further Explain Links on Your Site\n\nAs Google points out, it's fine to use multiple rel values in some situations.\n\nFor example, some search engines don't support the rel=\"ugc\" and rel=\"sponsored\" tags. In such cases, you can combine either of these attributes with the nofollow attribute. Like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://yourwebsite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Link text</a>\nHow to Check for Issues with Your Outbound Links\n\nUse Semrush's Site Audit tool to detect link issues that can affect your SEO strategy. Addressing these problems may improve your chances of ranking in search results. And prevent penalties.\n\nTo get started, open the Site Audit tool.\n\nEnter your domain name in the designated field, and click “Start Audit.”\n\nOnce you have configured the tool, it will audit your site and generate a report:\n\nClick “Issues” next to the “Overview” tab to check for problems with your external links. These fall into three categories:\n\nErrors: High-severity issues you should address immediately\nWarnings: Medium-severity issues that require your attention\nNotices: Potential problems to be aware of\n\nNext, enter “external links” in the search box. Site Audit will display potential issues related to your outbound links. Like broken external links (i.e., hyperlinks that point to a non-existent webpage or resource).\n\nThis issue will appear under \"Warnings.\"\n\nTo find specific links, click on the error to see your list of broken links. And where they appear on your website or blog.\n\nThen, click “Why and how to fix it” to learn more about the error. And how you can resolve it.\n\nRemove or redirect broken links, as they can affect your site’s user experience.\n\nSemrush’s Site Audit can also detect external links with the nofollow attribute. This potential issue will appear under \"Notices.\"\n\nClick on “# outgoing external links” to view the links in question.\n\nIn the above example, some of the links under \"Link URL\" look spammy. Don't click on them. Instead, click the arrow sign next to them to open the webpages where those links appear. \n\nFor instance, \"http://a2z.linksind.net/?S*32d19\" is a UGC link in an article comment.\n\nYou can either delete the comment (since it provides no value) or add the UGC tag to it. Alternatively, use the nofollow and UGC tags together.\n\nIf a link doesn’t look spammy, simply remove the nofollow tag. Or use a different rel attribute, depending on the link type.\n\nFurther reading: 11 Common Internal Linking Mistakes & How to Fix Them\n\nElevate Your Backlink Strategy with Semrush\n\nUGC links and other link attributes may have little impact on your site’s rankings.
