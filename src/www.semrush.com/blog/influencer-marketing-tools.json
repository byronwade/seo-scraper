Next, click “Filters.”\n\nIn this example, we’ll search for YouTube influencers using filters to narrow the results.\n\nNext, apply filters. For example, you can choose to only see YouTube creators within a particular subscriber range. Or located in a particular country.\n\nYou’ll get a list of results that match your filter criteria.\n\nClick on any influencer to open their profile and get more data, including:\n\nAverage number of video likes\nMedian engagement rate\nAverage comments per 10,000 views\n\nIf the influencer looks like a good fit, click “Add to lists” to shortlist the profile. Later, use your lists for exporting data, launching a campaign, or to review and campaign your final selections.\n\nInfluencer Analytics also has features for:\n\nCompetitor Analysis: Check which apps and brands are being mentioned by YouTube and Twitch influencers\nCampaign Management: Keep track of live and scheduled influencer content, total influencer video views, total spending, cost per mille (CPM, or cost per thousand impressions), and more \n“Tops”: Get ranked lists of the top influencers per social channel or country. By subscriber count, view count, or engagement rate.\nWhat We Like\n\nInfluencer Analytics is a beginner-friendly tool. It requires no training to use, there’s a free trial, and monthly pricing is accessible for small businesses starting out with influencer marketing.\n\nPricing\n\nPricing for the Basic plan is $169/month. Available add-ons include:\n\nCompetitor Analysis for $129/month\nCampaign Management for $69/month\n\nDiscover Top Influencers\n\nwith the Influencer Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nModash\n\nModash is an influencer marketing tool for finding, analyzing, managing, and tracking influencers.\n\nUse cases: \n\nInfluencer discovery\nAnalysis\nOutreach\nClient relationship management (CRM)\nCampaign tracking\n\nThe discovery feature lets you search for influencers in four ways:\n\nFilter through over 250 million influencers using criteria like audience demographics and engagement rate\nFind lookalikes of influencers you already work with\nCheck your brand’s Instagram followers for influencers\nImport a list of customer emails to see if any are influential\n\nOnce you find relevant influencers, the analysis tool lets you review their audience, performance, and content. Without having to reach out first. \n\nIt looks like this:\n\nImage Source: Modash\n\nModash also has an influencer tracking tool.\n\nInstead of manually grabbing links to live influencer content, the tool automatically collects it. It saves all your influencer content to one dashboard. Ready for reporting, analysis, or repurposing.\n\nImage Source: Modash\n\nThere’s a Shopify integration, too. So you can see discount code redemptions per creator for return on investment (ROI) data.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nFor influencer discovery, Modash’s influencer database isn’t limited by size. It’s an “open-network” database, which means it collects public data. You can filter through every creator with over 1,000 followers on Instagram, YouTube, or TikTok. \n\nIt’s not a limited database of pre-vetted influencers, so you won’t run out of potential candidates. Regardless of location or niche.\n\nPricing\n\nModash has a14-day free trial, and paid plans start from $99/month (paid annually) or $120/month (paid monthly). Pricing scales up to enterprise based on usage.\n\n(Disclaimer: I’m employed by Modash.)\n\nGRIN\n\nGRIN is an influencer marketing platform specializing in ecommerce workflows.\n\nUse cases:\n\nInfluencer marketing automation\nManaging affiliates\nProduct seeding/influencer gifting\n\nGRIN’s strength is improving influencer marketing workflows for ecommerce brands.\n\nSome of its features include:\n\nCreator approvals: It provides a portal through which influencers can submit their creative concepts for the brand team to give feedback\nContracts: GRIN integrates with Docusign to keep influencer contracts in one place\nInfluencer gifting: Sync your ecommerce store, let creators choose products, and ship them from within the GRIN interface\n\nGRIN also has a feature for creator payments. You can add funds to GRIN and pay out through PayPal. GRIN handles creator 1099s and helps you to analyze your influencer spend.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nGRIN has great coverage in ecommerce integrations like Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, and Klaviyo.\n\nPricing\n\nGRIN’s pricing isn’t publicly available. An annual contract is required, and professional services are available as an add-on.\n\nAudience Intelligence \n\nAudience Intelligence uses social data to provide in-depth consumer segmentation and cultural insights, including influencer analysis.\n\nUse Cases:\n\nIdentify audience segments \nEvaluate influencer compatibility for brand alignment\nMonitor influencer trends\n\nSome of Audience Intelligence's key features include:\n\nDemographic Insights: Gain a comprehensive breakdown of your audience’s age, gender, location, and interests\nBehavioral Analysis: Understand how audiences interact with content across different platforms\nInfluencer Match-Score: Assess the compatibility between an influencer and your brand’s target audience using a proprietary algorithm\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\nSimply enter the brand or personality's social media handle to create a report.\n\nThen, click on “See all influencers” under “Top Influencers.”.\n\nThe tool will generate a list of potentially relevant influencers.\n\nYou can then refine your search by applying filters across various categories to find the best match for your needs.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nAudience Intelligence provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to access powerful data.\n\nIt goes beyond basic demographics to reveal detailed reports that help marketers understand an audience and find the right influencers to work with. \n\nPricing\n\nAudience Intelligence starts at $150 monthly for one report. However, you can add more reports for extra fees\n\nUpfluence\n\nUpfluence is an all-in-one influencer marketing platform.\n\nUse cases:\n\nInfluencer discovery\nAnalysis\nGifting\nTracking\nPayments\n\nThere are a lot of overlapping features with the previous tools. Upfluence features include:\n\nInfluencer discovery: For Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Twitch, Pinterest, and blogs\nInfluencer analytics: To get audience and performance data for influencer selection\nSales tracking: Through promo codes and links\n\nUpfluence also has an end-to-end affiliate management feature. You can find potential affiliates, create their tracking links, report on activity, and handle the payouts.\n\nImage Source: Upfluence\n\nWhat We Like\n\nWhile Upfluence’s discovery database is smaller overall, it covers many platforms. For example, some other tools in this list won’t help you to find influencers on Pinterest or X (while Upfluence does).\n\nPricing\n\nUpfluence’s pricing isn’t publicly available. They offer a hybrid agency-SaaS model, with professional services available as an add-on to platform plans. An annual contract is required.\n\nPitchbox\n\nCompared to the all-in-one influencer marketing tools above, Pitchbox is a more specialized solution for outreach.\n\nUse cases: \n\nInfluencer outreach\n\nPitchbox is built primarily for link building use cases. Which means it works best when looking for influential websites, bloggers, and journalists. However you can import your own contact list to leverage the features for social media influencer outreach, too.\n\nIt has several useful features that make influencer outreach more efficient:\n\nSchedule the optimal send times to maximize deliverability\nAutomate follow-up sequences\nUse conditional logic in email templates\n\nConditional logic lets you customize emails depending on various factors. For example, you might create a template that sends “Sentence A” if the recipient is an ecommerce site and “Sentence B” if the recipient is a SaaS site.\n\nThere are also lots of helpful integrations, including Semrush. That means you’ll get Semrush data like blog traffic and backlinks to verify and prioritize outreach prospects. \n\nOther integrations include Zapier, Looker Studio, and Slack.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nPitchbox has great template features. You can customize and save templates for your team with personalization and conditional logic.\n\nIt also offers analytics to help you compare the performance of each template.\n\nPricing\n\nPitchbox pricing starts from $550/month (paid monthly) or $495/month (paid annually). They also offer an enterprise tier starting at $1,500/month (paid monthly) or $1,350/month (paid annually). Pricing scales based on the number of outreach emails.\n\nBuzzSumo\n\nBuzzSumo is a content marketing tool. For influencer marketing specifically, use it to find the most shared content in your niche, who created it, and who shared it.\n\nUse cases: \n\nInfluencer discovery\nContent and trends research\n\nThere’s an influencer search feature with various ways to discover influencers depending on the platform. It works for Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube.\n\nFor example, with X, you can search based on things like topics, keywords in Twitter bio, influencer location, and more.\n\nThere’s also a “Content Analyzer” feature that lets you find the most shared content by topic. From there, you can look through the list of authors for potential influencers. BuzzSumo also provides a “Top Sharers” list to let you find influential people who shared that content, too.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nBuzzSumo is good for finding journalists. Which is helpful if you’re using influencers as part of a digital public relations (PR) strategy.\n\nThere’s a large journalist database, and the tool offers features throughout to help with finding journalists. For example, the influencer search tool lets you separate the results to show only journalists.\n\nPricing\n\nBuzzSumo’s pricing starts from $199/month (paid monthly) or $159/month (paid annually). Pricing scales based on features needed and user seats. There is a 30-day free trial.\n\nCollabstr\n\nCollabstr is a marketplace for influencer marketing. It connects brands with influencers and content creators who are actively seeking brand collaborations.\n\nUse cases: \n\nInfluencer discovery\nInfluencer payments\nManaging influencer communications\nGetting user-generated content\n\nOn Collabstr, you can search for Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube influencers. There are thousands of pre-vetted creators. Search by platform, topics, location, price range, and gender.\n\nCreators can list off-the-shelf packages that brands can buy. Or make a custom offer.\n\nAll outreach and conversations with influencers happen directly within the platform. Collabstr processes the influencer payments, too.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe advantage of using a marketplace like Collabstr is that the creators are proactively looking for collaborations. And their pricing is often publicly listed. Together, those two things make recruitment much faster.\n\nThe flip side is that the potential pool of influencers is much smaller, and they’re likely working with similar brands already. But if you need to move quickly, it could be a good option for your brand.\n\nPricing\n\nCollabstr has no upfront cost. The platform charges a 15% fee on the creator’s earnings and offers optional managed services for brands.\n\nStoryclash\n\nStoryclash is a multi-purpose influencer marketing platform.\n\nUse cases: \n\nInfluencer discovery\nInfluencer campaign tracking\nReporting on influencer marketing\nInfluencer CRM\n\nLike some of the tools above (Modash, Grin, Upfluence), Storyclash is an all-in-one tool.\n\nIt has features for:\n\nInfluencer discovery: Including AI search to find influencers using natural language. For example, you can get influencer suggestions by typing “Instagram influencers with curly hair.”\nInfluencer campaign tracking: Instead of screenshotting live influencer content, Storyclash collects it and saves it to a dashboard for convenience\nInfluencer marketing reporting: Create and share reports showing data like content output, promo code redemptions, ROI, and more\n\nImage Source: Capterra\n\nWhat We Like\n\nFor each creator in their database, Storyclash offers a brand collaboration timeline. It shows the brands the creator has published sponsored content with, when it went live, and how frequently they’ve worked together.\n\nPricing\n\nStoryclash pricing starts at €899/month (around $975). It scales up based on features you need, team seats, level of support, and more. An annual contract is required.\n\nAwario\n\nAwario is a tool for tracking brand mentions across the internet. \n\nUse cases: \n\nSocial listening\nInfluencer discovery\n\nUsing Awario to find organic mentions of your brand on websites and social media is a great influencer discovery tactic. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause creators who mention your brand organically are likely to perform well. \n\nYou know they already love your brand (if the sentiment is positive). So if you reach out to build a paid relationship, you’ll know their content is authentic.\n\nIf you already have live campaigns with influencers, use Awario to report on some performance metrics. Like reach and engagement rate (broken down by locations), share of voice, and more.\n\nAwario also offers white-label reporting, which allows agencies to deliver on-brand reports to clients.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe social listening feature offers a lot of filtering options to help you find the most relevant conversations about your brand. For example, you can add negative keywords to remove irrelevant conversations. Or, filter by platform or country. \n\nPricing\n\nAwario pricing starts from $49/month (paid monthly) or $29/month (paid annually).\n\nHow Influencer Marketing Tools Fit Into Your Strategy\n\nInfluencer marketing tools can’t create a strategy for you. But they help you to execute tasks more efficiently.\n\nThat means you need to have a basic strategy in place before onboarding a tool. Once your strategy is clear, you can better discern which influencer marketing tools align best with your needs.\n\nHere are some key considerations you should address:\n\nGoals for Influencer Marketing\n\nWhat do you want to achieve with influencer marketing? Is it:\n\nA performance channel measured by directly attributable sales?\nA brand awareness channel measured by reach and engagement?\nA mix?\n\nYour answer could change your tool requirements.\n\nFor example, if your goal is sales, you’ll need a tool that supports link clicks and promo code redemptions for attribution.\n\nHow to Compensate Influencers\n\nThere are several ways to compensate influencers. Like:\n\nGifting free products\nAffiliate commissions\nFlat fee payments\nFree trips and experiences\n\n(It’s common to use a mixture.)\n\nThe type of compensation you plan to use will impact your tooling decisions. \n\nFor example, some tools can support affiliate links and payouts, while others can’t. Similarly, some tools help with shipping products to influencers—while others don’t.\n\nThe Type and Size of Influencer You’ll Collaborate with\n\nYour budget and strategy will change the type of influencer you aim to collaborate with (which, in turn, changes your tool requirements).\n\nFor example, if you’re compensating via affiliate commissions or free products, you’ll probably need to find a high volume of nano influencers (1,000-10,000 followers). Since larger influencers are more likely to require upfront fees.\n\nYou should also think about which social platforms your target audience hangs out on. Not every tool in this list supports every social platform. Some can’t find Instagram influencers, others can’t find Twitch influencers (etc.).\n\nAccelerate Your Influencer Program with Tools\n\nYou might not need influencer marketing tools from day one. But once you’re starting to gain traction with influencer collaborations, tools quickly become a no-brainer to scale your program.\n\nThe best tools for you depend on your strategy and budget.\n\nIf you want to find and work with YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok influencers, try a free trial of Influencer Analytics. It has everything you need to research competitors, find your first influencers, and manage the campaign.\n\nAccelerate Your Influencer Marketing\n\nwith the Influencer Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
