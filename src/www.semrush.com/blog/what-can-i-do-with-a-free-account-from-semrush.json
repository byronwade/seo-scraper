  "content": "There’s a ton of Semrush tools and data you can access without ever paying a cent. \n\nAll it takes is a couple of minutes of your time.\n\nNot sure which subscription level to go for or you don’t have the budget to support a paid account yet?\n\nThis post is for you. \n\nTwo Types of Free Semrush Accounts\n\nSemrush is officially one of the top marketing software products in the world today.\n\nIt is subscription-based, but by simply creating a free account you can experience much of the software’s capabilities for free.\n\nThere are two main types of free account you can create:\n\nA Simple Sign-up Account\n\nWith this account, you can enjoy limited access to certain Semrush tools and features without any time constraints.\n\nThis means you can enjoy your free account for as long as you want without providing your credit card details and without ever being charged for it.\n\nPlus: You can explore Semrush App Center, a growing marketplace of tools for common marketing jobs, with a free account. Inside the App Center you’ll find dozens of specialized apps, all of which can be tested with a free trial or as a free app. \n\nA Free Trial Account\n\nThis gives you free access to all the marketing goodness Semrush has to offer for 7 days. \n\nYou can trial either one of the Pro or Guru accounts.\n\nThis means that for 7 days you can have full access for free to all the features paid users enjoy. \n\nTo create a free trial account, you will need to provide your card details. \n\n(But, hey, if you change your mind before your free trial expires you can cancel your subscription and you won’t be charged.)\n\nAfter the 7-day period passes, you are automatically moved to the paid plan you have signed up for. Unless you cancel your subscription in the meantime. \n\nThis article will break down what you can do with a simple, free account. You will also find answers to the most common questions. \n\nIf you’re interested in a free trial instead, head over to the Semrush pricing page to find the plan that better suits your needs and sign up.\n\nBut First: Who Needs a Free Semrush Account?\n\nNo matter what your marketing needs are, Semrush allows you to build and manage your entire digital strategy from a single platform. \n\nFrom SEO and PPC to content marketing and go-to-market—we’ve got you.\n\nWe have built over 50 tools to help you do this. \n\nWith data for over 140 countries. \n\nBut we also know big dreams often have humble beginnings. You may not have the budget, the knowledge, or the resources to afford one of our paid plans. \n\nAnd that’s ok. \n\nWe want to empower every marketer out there to perform at the top of their game. \n\nEvery. Single. Day. \n\nThis is why anyone can create a free account with Semrush. And why some of our tools and apps are completely free to use, simply by signing up.\n\nHere’s a few things you can do with your free account:\n\nPerform Keyword research\nPerform a competitor analysis\nTrack keyword rankings\nRun a technical site audit\nAudit your local listings \n\nPlus more. \n\nUsing Free Semrush Tools for SEO \n\nHere's how to make the most of your free account.\n\n1. Perform Keyword Research for Free\n\nYou can run 10 keyword searches per day using the Keyword Magic Tool or the Keyword Overview. \n\nEach search in the Keyword Magic Tool will return a report limited to 10 results.\n\nSo on a daily basis you can get 10 x 10=100 results to cover your keyword research needs. \n\nLike the one below:\n\nOr like this with the Keyword Overview tool:\n\nYou don’t just get data around the monthly search volume (MSV) with your free account.\n\nHere’s just some of what you can do in one click:\n\nCheck how difficult it will be to rank for a keyword organically (Keyword Difficulty)\nGet a breakdown of the global MSV into country-specific MSVs\nIdentify the search intent type behind your keyword (so you can decide what type of content to build in order to target it)\nDiscover if interest around it in the past 12 months has been growing, shrinking or has been relatively steady\nEstimate what it costs to target this term with paid search ads \nCheck the level of competition between advertisers bidding on the analyzed keyword within their PPC campaigns\nSee what features the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) contains (from featured snippets to reviews and ads)\nFind out which the top 10 ranking pages are for a keyword\nGet ideas for relevant questions or keywords to your seed keyword\n\nAll this (and more) for any of the 142 countries in our database. \n\nFor over 25,000,000,000 keywords. (That’s 25 BILLION in case you lost count with all the 0s.)\n\nPro tip: If you’re interested in analyzing a keyword in-depth (for example, discover how search interest around it has trended for the past 12 months) run your search on the Keyword Overview tool for in-depth analysis. To discover more keyword ideas that are relevant to your seed keyword, run your search on the Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nIf you reach your daily limit you will have to wait until your allowance gets refreshed the next day. \n\n(Or, you know… sign up for a free trial and up your limits for free for 7 days.)\n\nShould you choose to try out or sign up for a paid account, you can access even more results.\n\n2. Analyze Competitors for Free\n\nYou can analyze up to 10 domains per day using Domain Overview. \n\nWhether you’re running a competitor analysis, diving into your website’s performance, or pitching to a prospective client, this is where you can discover a wealth of data around:\n\nHow many and which keywords a domain ranks for (in both Organic and Paid Search)\nPositions distribution for these keywords\nMain competitors (in Organic and in Paid Search)\nTop keywords driving traffic\nBranded vs. Non-Branded traffic split\nNumber of backlinks and referring domains\n\nAnd so much more. \n\nSee how this tool allows you to gain insights into both the organic and the paid performance of any domain? It’s not just useful for your SEO efforts but also for any top-level analysis you’re looking to run for paid strategies too.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind: Your daily limit of 10 searches refers to the total number of searches you can perform within one day using any of our keyword research and domain analytics tools. \n\nMeaning that if you search for \"semrush.com\", for example, in Domain Overview, that’s 1 search out of 10. \n\nIf you then click to view details about the top ranking keywords for this domain and get transferred to the Organic Research report, that’s another search. \n\nIf you then pick \"seo software\" as a keyword to type in the Keyword Magic Tool, that’s another, so your remaining allowance after that will be 7. And so on. \n\n3. Track Your Keyword Rankings for Free\n\nFree users can track up to 10 keywords using the Position Tracking tool in 4 easy steps:\n\nSet up your project (you are allowed to set up 1 project as a free user, which gives you access to 7 standalone tools)\nEnter your domain\nSet your location and device type\nCreate a list of keywords to track \n\nPosition tracking allows you to monitor your rankings at local level (down to ZIP code). \n\nWhich is particularly useful if local SEO forms an important part of your SEO strategy. \n\nYou can also set up alerts so you’re notified of any changes in rankings.\n\nThe tool will track your rankings and those of your competitors daily. \n\nYou access all this data on the results tabs for your target keyword list. You are then able to check not only your ranking positions, but also your visibility or estimated traffic from these keywords versus those of your competitors.\n\nYou can discover a ton of information in Position Tracking, from daily fluctuations for each keyword to opportunities to earn featured snippets.\n\nBased on these insights you can decide whether, when, and how to act.\n\n4. Run a Free Website Audit\n\nAs a free user, you can crawl up to a 100 URLs with the Site Audit. This includes crawls of any given domain, subdomain, or subfolder. \n\nYou will end up with:\n\nAn overall health score for your website \nDetailed reports about all the issues we find, grouped based on how serious they are (“Errors” are the most serious issues, while “Notices” will have a lesser impact on your organic performance)\nBreakdown of each issue and recommendations on how to fix it\nThematic reports, which help you gain a clear idea of how your site performs in a specific area \n\nThematic reports include:\n\nCrawlability: Is it accessible to search engines?\nSecurity: Is HTTPS implemented correctly?\nInternal linking and site architecture: Do you have orphan pages or deep pages on your site that search engines struggle to get to?\nStructured data and markup: Any issues with structured data implementation will be listed here.\nAnd more…\n5. Monitor Your Local Listings \n\nIf local SEO is part of your growth strategy, start with a free audit within the Listing Management tool.\n\nYou can check the status of your local listings in more than 70+ authoritative directories in the US (from Google Business Profile and Yelp to Trip Advisor and Bing).\n\nThis feature can help you track your local listings in over 25 countries, including the UK, Australia, Canada, France, and Germany.\n\nSimply enter your company name to generate the report with the status of your business listing for each directory.\n\nThe findings from this audit can help you decide on next steps for your local SEO strategy.\n\nUsing Your Free Semrush Account for Content Marketing\n\nThere are three main ways in which a free user can leverage Semrush for content marketing. These are:\n\n6. Get Recommendations for Content Optimization\n\nInput one or more target keywords into an SEO Content Template and get insights into your competition, relevant keywords your content should include, and what your text’s length could be.\n\nYou can use these to create a content brief or your copy.\n\nWith a free account you can create only one SEO Content Template.\n\n7. Create Optimized and User-Friendly Content \n\nOnce you’re ready to start writing, you can use the SEO Writing Assistant. \n\nThis tool proposes ways to optimize your copy, improve its readability, and integrate the SEO Content Template recommendations, too.\n\nYou can add new content to it or import the content from an existing page. \n\nIt also works as a plug-in with Google Docs, WordPress, and MS Word. During the life of your free account, you’re able to create two SEO Writing Assistant documents.\n\n8. Get Ideas on How to Improve On-Page Content and SEO\n\nYou need to create a campaign using the On Page SEO Checker. \n\nSimply add your target keyword(s) and the corresponding URL, and you will end up with a report with ideas on:\n\nIssues that need sorting out \nMissing elements that are holding your page’s performance back\n\nDid you know? In addition to content-related ideas, the On Page SEO checker proposes technical fixes as well as recommends how to target SERP features, which secondary keywords to include, and where to get backlinks from.\n\nThe On Page SEO Checker and SEO Content Template tools function using “SEO Ideas units\". Each target keyword you input into one of these, will count as one SEO Ideas unit. \n\nFree accounts come with only 10 units in total for the two tools. \n\nYou’re allowed to:\n\nCreate one SEO Content Template\nSet up one On-Page SEO Checker campaign\n\nSo, you can use the 10 units (keywords) however you prefer across your On Page SEO Checker campaign and SEO Content Template.\n\nExample: If you create an SEO Content Template targeting a single keyword, the number of SEO Ideas units you have for your On-Page SEO Checker campaign would now be 9. \n\nIf you now want to use the SEO Writing Assistant, it will provide recommendations for the keyword specified in the SEO Content Template.\n\nIf you find yourself stumbling on the block of these account limitations, consider a free trial. This will allow you to use Semrush to its full potential for free for 7 days.\n\nGet a free access to all in one platform\n\nSEO, PPC, Content Marketing, and Competitive Research.\n\nGet a FREE trial →\nExplore Free Apps & Trials\n\nOnce you have a free Semrush account, you can explore the Semrush App Center. \n\nThis is our marketplace of specialized marketing apps, featuring both apps built by Semrush and by our trusted partners. \n\nWhile most apps offer free trials and limited free-level access, you can also find several apps that are totally free to use.\n\nSome of the most popular apps offering free trials allow you to:\n\nStudy Your Competitor’s Ads\n\nAdClarity - Advertising Intelligence allows you to research any advertiser’s activity on Google Display, social media ads, and YouTube ads. Use the free 7-day trial to run an advertising competitor analysis on your top rivals.\n\nFind Influencers & Creators to Partner With\n\nInfluencer Analytics boasts a database of 30M influencers across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch.

With a free 3-day trial, you can generate hundreds of static & video ads for Google Display or social media ad campaigns with the help of AI. Download the ones you want to test and put them in your next campaign.\n\nHow Else You Can Use Your Free Semrush Account \nAudit your website backlinks and identify those that can hinder your performance\nIdentify opportunities for link building\nPlan and monitor a link building campaign\nTrack the search performance of specific content pages on your site \n\nIn all the above cases, your limitations with a free account mean you can use the relevant tools for a limited scope of work.\n\nThe above should give you a good idea of what goes into a free Semrush account. You may decide that a free-level account works for you, even if it means limiting your resources. \n\nIf you are interested in the paid options Semrush offers, check our pricing page for more information. \n\nFAQs\nDo I need to add banking details in order to create a free account with Semrush?\n\nNo. All you need to do is set up your login details using your email address.
