  "content": "What Are Google My Business Management Tools?\n\nGoogle My Business management tools are third-party tools that support your business’s local SEO efforts. They do this by helping you properly optimize your Google Business Profile listing. \n\nFormerly known as Google My Business, or GMB, Google Business Profile (GBP) lets you manage the information your customers can see across Google Search and Google Maps. \n\nGBP tools offer additional functionality on top of the native Google Business Profile (GBP) dashboard. Each feature is designed to give you greater control over your local SEO tasks.\n\nWhy Should You Use Google Business Profile Management Tools?\n\nLeveraging the right GBP tools can effectively improve your organic rankings for local keywords. And boost your click-through rates, website traffic, and in-store visits.\n\nPlus, you are more likely to regularly update your GBP listing when you can perform all tasks conveniently on your own time.\n\nFor example, many tools allow you to pre-schedule photos and GBP posts. Consistently doing both of these tasks can enhance your local visibility. \n\nIn this post, we’ll look at 11 leading Google Business Profile management tools to help you choose the right one for your local SEO needs.\n\nFurther reading: Local SEO: What Is It and How to Do It\n\n1. Semrush Listing Management Tool\n\nSemrush’s Listing Management tool offers a complete local SEO suite for service-area businesses. With it, you get every feature you need to improve your local presence. \n\nYou won’t need another Google My Business management tool.\n\nWith Semrush’s Listing Management tool, you can:\n\nUpdate and manage key details like your business description, business locations, operating hours, and business categories\nSee, manage, and respond to business reviews from a single dashboard\nSchedule GBP posts using Listing Management’s sister tool, Social Media Toolkit\nConnect your social profiles to your business listing\nOptimize your listing for voice search\nTrack your search engine rankings for local keywords in different zip codes\nVisualize your keyword performance for different areas of the map with the Heatmap feature\nAudit your GBP account for issues or errors and learn how to fix them\nMonitor your competitors to uncover their strategy and see how you compare\n\nListing Management distributes accurate business name, business address, and phone number (NAP) information to 70+ top US directories and more than 40 international ones in minutes. \n\nDo you have old citations that contain inaccurate information and need updating? You can also bulk-edit these with a few clicks.\n\nPricing: Users can audit up to five locations per day for free. You get access to features like local tracking, review management, and other GBP management tools with the Basic Location Plan from $20/month. \n\nUpgrading to the $40/month Premium plan will get you exclusive access to the Heatmap feature—plus the ability to respond to reviews directly from the tool. See all the available plans here.\n\nHere’s how you can start distributing your business info to create local citations with Listing Management.\n\nGo to “Local SEO” > “Listing Management.”\n\nYour next step will look slightly different based on whether you have used this tool before or not. \n\nIf this is your first time, you’ll come to a page where you can add your business information. Semrush Listing will then start distributing your profile to local directories. \n\nInput your business name or location in the search bar. \n\nYour business and address will show up in the left drop-down menu. If you have multiple locations, check the address carefully and select the right one.\n\nIf you’re tracking an existing location and want to add a new one, click on the “Add location” button in the top right corner. \n\nType your business name and address in the search bar. Select your business from the options that show up. \n\nNow, Semrush will generate a report that shows you your business’s average ratings. Plus an “Online presence” score that tells you if your listing is optimized correctly. As well the number of listings you need to fix.\n\nPro tip\n\nYou can also search for your competitors’ business this way to see how they are doing. You’ll know what you need to do to beat their rankings in the local pack.\n\nIf you scroll down, you’ll be able to see what issues each of your listings have.\n\nTo start distributing the correct business information to local directories, scroll back up and click on “Continue setup.” \n\nNote\n\nYou’ll be able to see how to fix your listings after this step. \n\nEnter your business info, select the right category, and click “Start distributing info.”\n\nNow, Semrush will automatically submit your business info to 70+ and 40+ citations in the US and worldwide, respectively.\n\nNeed to fix the citations you’ve already built? You can do that, too.\n\nAfter the tool finds your location, look at the “Your listings” box. It will show you how many local citations your business has built. \n\nGo to the “Duplicates” tab to see the duplicate listings you need to fix. \n\nDuplicates can arise if customers, competitors, or teammates attempt to create a profile for your business. They may contain incorrect or partial information which can confuse searchers looking for your company. \n\nIf you have a duplicate listing, choose “Suppress” to remove it. Otherwise, mark it as “Not a duplicate.”\n\nWant to know your current performance in Google Maps searches so you can improve it? Here’s how to track local pack rankings.\n\nGo to the “Heatmap” box. Set up the keywords you want to track and select Grid size. Click “Collect data.”\n\nIf it’s your first time doing this, you’ll be prompted to confirm you have selected the right grid settings. Click “Start scan.”\n\nNow you can see your business’s average rank, and its specific rank for different areas of the Google map.\n\nClick “Optimize Your Location” for the steps you can take to rank higher. \n\nWhen you know where you stand against your competitors, you can get more focused with your SEO efforts. Perform these tasks to get more local visibility for your GBP profile. \n\nTip\n\nRead our five-step guide on how to make the most of Semrush’s GBP management tool.\n\n2.
