From there, you can let the rest take care of itself. \n\nOn the other hand, if your business isn’t getting enough organic WOM, you can generate amplified WOM through marketing campaigns. \n\nA common strategy for creating campaigns is finding brand advocates, a.k.a, people who actively promote your product with their networks (mostly on social media platforms). \n\nTinder is an excellent example of a WOM marketing campaign. When the app went live in 2012, they relied completely on brand ambassadors to spread the word. Thanks to WOM, they already had 50 million users just two years after launching. \n\nUsing influencers to spread the word about your brand is another effective WOM marketing strategy. \n\nAudible worked with influencers to target YouTube users. By using influencers from different backgrounds, they were able to target people with a variety of interests. They worked with influencers in gaming, entertainment, people and blog, film and animation, etc.\n\nAs a result, Audible reached over 123 million YouTube viewers in one single WOM marketing campaign. \n\nWhile organic WOM is the best and longest-term strategy for your business, and you can be quite successful from it, you can definitely kickstart your word-of-mouth strategy by using amplified WOM. \n\nWe hope these word-of-mouth statistics helped you shape an idea of how powerful WOMM is and give you thoughts on how to use it in your business’s future. \n\nSolid keyword research underpins every successful SEO and PPC strategy.
