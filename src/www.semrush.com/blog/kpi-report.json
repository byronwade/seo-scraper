  "content": "KPI reports are increasingly vital as businesses strive to achieve their objectives and stay competitive.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore what KPI reports are and why they’re so important. We’ll also share steps for creating them. We’ll then detail different types of reports you can use to make informed decisions that drive success.\n\nLet’s start with the basics.\n\nWhat Is a KPI?\n\nA KPI, or Key Performance Indicator, is a measurable value of how well your company is achieving specific business objectives over time. \n\nThink of a KPI as a compass. \n\nA compass guides you to figure out your current location and where to go. Similarly, a KPI tracks your progress in specific areas of performance in a business. For example, sales growth. \n\nBoth help you determine if you’re in the right position and moving in the desired direction. And enable you to make necessary adjustments along the way. \n\nKPIs apply to every type and size of organization. From a small business tracking monthly sales to a multinational corporation monitoring global supply chain efficiency.\n\nBusinesses can customize KPIs to suit their specific needs and objectives. Reporting on them indicates what’s working, or not.\n\nWhat Is a KPI Report?\n\nA KPI report provides a snapshot of an organization’s performance in terms of its key goals. Every report targets specific objectives, such as: \n\nAssessing overall business performance\nEvaluating a specific department\nAnalyzing a particular project\n\nKPI reporting is an essential tool for performance tracking that allows businesses to quantitatively assess their progress over time. (We’ll talk about specific kinds of KPI reports later.) \n\nKPI reports usually include different types of data visualization—think charts, graphs, and tables. These elements illustrate trends, patterns, and insights in an easily digestible format. \n\nLike this:\n\nVisuals also help stakeholders grasp complex metrics at a glance. \n\nYou’ll find both current and historical data in most KPI report templates. These allow you to perform comparative analysis over different periods. \n\nWhy Are KPI Reports Important?\n\nKPI reports provide detailed insights into performance. This way, businesses can identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. \n\nThat information can guide your strategic decision-making.\n\nBeing visually easy to interpret, reports allow stakeholders at all levels to grasp the essential details without getting lost in the data.\n\nThink about it: \n\nIf you can’t understand where you are, how can you plan where you’re going? \n\nKPI reports essentially help you: \n\nStrategize \nMake informed decisions\nNavigate the market’s complexities\n\nYou can use these reports to align your resources and efforts toward long-term success.\n\nReport Your KPIs Free with My Reports\n\nConnect all your data sources to one report, align it with your brand, and easily automate report creation\n\nCreate a report →\nHow Is a KPI Report Different from a KPI Dashboard?\n\nConfused? Let’s clarify. \n\nA KPI dashboard provides a real-time snapshot of key performance metrics. \n\nA traditional KPI dashboard enables quick assessments but doesn’t offer a comprehensive understanding. It allows you to view data from different angles by:\n\nFiltering\nDrilling down\nChanging parameters\n\nMeanwhile, a KPI report offers an in-depth analysis of a business’s performance over time. \n\nIt facilitates a deeper perception of the data found on a KPI dashboard. So you can uncover trends, patterns, and underlying factors with features like:\n\nCommentary\nInsights\nVisualizations\n\nHere’s what a Google Analytics dashboard of KPIs looks like:\n\nYou can see there’s a lot to digest in one glance. From here, you can generate different reports to narrow your focus.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nA traditional dashboard’s interactivity allows quick assessments and a current view of performance. But it doesn’t offer the same contextual understanding as a report, with its historical analysis and interpretation.\n\nLuckily, most modern dashboards give you the best of both worlds. \n\nHow?\n\nYou get immediate insights through the dashboard. As well as a deeper, more considered examination through downloadable reports.\n\nFor instance, Semrush’s My Reports tool integrates data from multiple dashboards. It allows you to see all your data in one place, but also to generate useful, in-depth reports. (More on this tool later).\n\nWith those essentials covered, let’s move on to KPI report creation.\n\n9 Steps to Create a KPI Report (with Best Practices)\n\nThe report creation process generally involves the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Define Goals\n\nEstablish long-term goals that you hope to achieve (e.g., the business objectives you’ll build your KPI report around). A clear strategy and objective will help you set the right KPIs to track.\n\nMake your goals easier to measure by breaking them down into SMART objectives. \n\nFor example, your long-term goal may be to increase website traffic within a year. \n\nWhat short-term objectives can you achieve within that time frame to reach your target? \n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\nIncrease organic search traffic by 10% in six months\nIncrease paid search impressions by 20% in three months\nDouble social media referral visits in two months\n\nYour short-term goals will then direct you to the KPIs you need to track to measure your progress.\n\nStep 2: Identify Relevant KPIs\n\nSelect metrics that will show your progress toward your goals. \n\nBase your choice of KPIs on your goals and data availability. But you should also consider factors like industry benchmarks and competitor performance.\n\nThe right KPI report contains accurate and up-to-date information that you can use to make timely decisions.\n\nSemrush’s My Reports tool makes it easy to track the right KPIs in your report. It transforms complex analytics dashboards into easy-to-read reports. These reports bridge the gap between real-time monitoring and in-depth analysis. \n\nLet’s return to our earlier example. Say you’re creating a marketing KPI report to show progress toward your “increase web traffic” goal. \n\nStart by selecting one of the pre-made report templates. Or start from scratch.\n\nTo build a custom report, use the widgets on the left to guide you. You’ll get a list of KPI categories you can include. \n\nFor example: \n\nClick on “Domain Analytics” to track website traffic.\n\nSince your focus is organic search traffic, select “Organic Research.”\n\nNext, choose from different KPI options. Drag and drop the widgets to build your report.\n\nSet goals and thresholds for each metric you include in the report. That way, you’ll be able to track performance at a glance.\n\nReport Your KPIs Free with My Reports\n\nConnect all your data sources to one report, align it with your brand, and easily automate report creation\n\nCreate a report →\nStep 3: Gather Data\n\nDecide which data sources to pull your report from. Make sure you get all the information you need to measure the KPIs you’ve defined.\n\nThere are plenty of data sources available—databases, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, marketing platforms, and even manual spreadsheets. \n\nVerify that each data source directly correlates with the KPI you’re tracking. \n\nFor example: \n\nIf you're measuring customer engagement, a CRM system might be more appropriate than a financial database.\n\nEach source should also provide accurate and consistent information. Cross-check and validate your data sets to ensure they offer dependable data over time. \n\nSemrush integrates with many data points like Google Data Studio and Google Analytics. \n\nThese integrations allow it to pull information from anywhere to centralize data collection and generate relevant reports.\n\nHowever, not all data is useful. Collecting irrelevant information can clutter the analysis. \n\nImportant: Audit your sources and trim the excess. \n\nFocus solely on the data that aligns with your target KPIs and reporting objectives. Maintaining a sharp focus on what truly matters will improve the report’s clarity.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the Data\n\nOnce you’ve got your KPI data, analyze it to help stakeholders understand what it means.\n\nFirst off: Know what each data point represents in the context of your goals and the larger business landscape. \n\nSuppose you’re analyzing customer feedback. Ask yourself:\n\nWhat topics are customers talking about? \nAre there any interesting patterns to consider?\n\nThen, look at the data across different time frames. Consider:\n\nHow does customer satisfaction vary week over week or month over month? \nWhat factors are driving these changes?\n\nNext, look at any anomalies. \n\nSpot any inconsistencies or outliers that might signal an underlying issue or an area of opportunity. Are certain products or services performing disproportionately better than others?\n\nStudy heat maps, line graphs, and pie charts. With visual representations, you can spot patterns more quickly and drill down into the details as necessary.\n\nSemrush automatically generates these charts so you can visualize your data: \n\nStep 5: Create the Report \n\nDocument your findings, including an analysis and recommendations for improvement.\n\nConsider your target audience and how “in the loop” they are. \n\nFor example: \n\nThe C-suite might need a more detailed explanation for a data set. Whereas department heads may just want the takeaway.\n\nStart with a summary of the key takeaways. Mention the most important findings and any recommendations for improvement.\n\nThen, provide a step-by-step explanation of the data analysis process. Include text to support visual elements and give readers an instant understanding of the context. \n\nHere’s how you do it:\n\nGo to the “Formatting” tab in “My Reports.”\n\nDrag and drop text boxes that add detail to the data you’ve already included.\n\nInclude any relevant references and resources to support your analysis and conclusions. \n\nYou should also draw connections to the existing business strategies or plans you were measuring against initially. So decision makers will be in a better position to understand how they can apply your findings to achieve their goals.\n\nFinally, provide recommendations on any next steps.\n\nBased on your findings, ask: \n\nWhat specific actions should you take? \nIs it necessary to adjust the existing strategies or plans in light of the data? \nStep 6: Decide on Distribution Channels\n\nThe next step is to make sure your report and its findings get in front of the right people. \n\nPlan out how you’ll distribute the report so key stakeholders can learn from and act on the data. This could be via email, shared network drives, or a business intelligence platform.\n\nAssess the needs and preferences of your audience. Some stakeholders might prefer a simple PDF summary. Others might want access to a live dashboard that lets them interact with the data in real time.\n\nTo share your report with Semrush, click on “Generate PDF Report.” \n\nFrom here, you can select how to distribute it. Email it or download it as an attachment. \n\nWhen deciding where to store the report, consider how people will access it: \n\nWill recipients need a username and password? \nDo users have enough access rights to the shared network or platform?\n\nSending out the report via email? Provide instructions on how to download, view, and print the document. \n\nFor a high-priority report that needs immediate attention: Use direct communication channels like email or instant messaging platforms. \n\nFor reports that stakeholders reference periodically: Store these on shared network drives.\n\nConsider also adding an expiration date for download links so people don’t access out-of-date reports.\n\nStep 7: Review and Update \n\nSchedule regular reviews of the KPI report to check that it aligns with current objectives. And that the KPIs continue to be relevant.\n\nWhat if business goals shift or the market landscape changes? \n\nMake the necessary adjustments to the report. Modify or add new KPIs that align with the updated focus.\n\nAsk for feedback soon after you distribute it while it’s still fresh in people’s minds. \n\nFeedback helps you gauge how useful people found the report. Use surveys or have one-on-one conversations with stakeholders to get their opinions about the document. It allows them to share additional insights you may not have included in the report.\n\nReal-time KPI dashboards that continuously update data are also a great option. Look for any tool that provides a live dashboard. Your report data will always be current, allowing more immediate responses to trends or issues.\n\nKeep a record of any updates or modifications to the KPI report. Documentation will maintain consistency and provide valuable context for future analyses.\n\nMonitoring and updating the KPI report is an ongoing responsibility. It’s how you ensure your report remains a dynamic, responsive “compass” to guide your business toward its desired outcomes.\n\nKPI Report Examples\n\nYou can create different types of KPI reports depending on their purpose.\n\nBelow is an overview of various kinds of reports for measuring performance in specific business areas.\n\nSEO KPI Report\n\nSEO KPI reports cover metrics related to things like: \n\nRankings for specific keywords \nBacklink profiles \nConversion rates from organic search traffic \n\nThey’re essential to measure how well your website performs in search engine results. And to find areas for improvement—like optimizing page structure or increasing keyword density.\n\nSemrush lets you automatically create all kinds of SEOKPI reports. \n\nHow?\n\nFor example, select the “Organic Search Positions” template in “My Reports.”\n\nEnter your domain to pull relevant analytics.\n\nSemrush then generates a comprehensive report.\n\nSemrush also has plenty of SEO reporting templates you can choose from—such as monthly SEO reports. \n\nThese templates allow you to get a more detailed analysis of specific KPIs. For instance, digging into the results of a website audit, a competitive analysis, or the success of a marketing campaign. \n\nPro tip: Integrate Google Analytics with Semrush for even deeper SEO insights to ace your organic search performance. \n\nContent Marketing KPI Report\n\nA content marketing KPI report shows you how well your content is engaging your audience and driving business goals. \n\nYou can include:\n\nPodcast downloads\nBlog visits\nSocial media engagement metrics\nContent shareability\n\nEverything you need to measure the effectiveness of your content.\n\nYou can also create a content funnel report. To see, step by step, how users engage with your content and convert—from first contact to purchase or subscription.\n\nThen, easily identify any drop-off points that may indicate an issue with the user experience.\n\nUse Semrush’s ImpactHero tool to analyze how successful your content is at each stage of the funnel.\n\nGive it time (at least one day) to collect data after setup. Return to the tool later and enter your domain to generate the report. \n\nThe first screen gives you an overview of your content’s performance.\n\nDrill down into more data by choosing one of the other tabs across the top. \n\nThe “Explorer” tab groups content performance by different stages of the funnel. Namely:\n\nAttraction shows data on the content that’s most effective in attracting your target audience to your site\nImpact reveals which content keeps your potential customers on your site and nurtures them through the funnel\nConversion lets you know which content is most effective at converting your website visitors\nSocial Media Marketing KPI Report\n\nYou can assess your social media marketing efforts using a social media KPI report. \n\nGet an overview of: \n\nHow well your posts are doing\nWhether they effectively engage your followers \nWhat strategies have been the most successful\n\nA tool like Semrush lets you gather all the data in one place. \n\nHere’s how:\n\nIntegrate your social profiles with Semrush Social.\n\nNow you’re all set to create a comprehensive social media report. Proceed to pick KPIs from the “Social Media Toolkit” widget in “My Reports.”\n\nYou can include metrics like: \n\nFollower growth\nPost engagement rate\nClick-through rates (CTRs) to other sites from shared content\nNumber of leads generated from social media campaigns\n\nLook at your social media KPI report to identify what works (and what doesn’t) in terms of content, visuals, timing, etc. You’ll find ways to maximize the impact of your social media presence. \n\nDigital Advertising KPI Report\n\nA Digital Advertising KPI report tracks the success and performance of your online advertising campaigns. \n\nIt highlights ad metrics including: \n\nCTR\nConversion rates\nImpressions \nCost per click (CPC)\nReturn on investment \n\nHelping you gauge how effectively a campaign meets its objectives. \n\nSales KPI Report\n\nA sales KPI report provides an in-depth look into sales performance.

As well as how close the team is to reaching sales targets. \n\nYou can break it down by individual sales team members’ performance. Or by specific products to allow for a granular analysis.\n\nFor instance: \n\nIf a particular region is consistently underperforming, the report might guide you to investigate. Are there training issues, market competition, or other factors at play? \n\nOr say a specific sales representative is surpassing all their goals. From a sales KPI report, you can identify best practices to replicate across the team. Look for data on the activities the rep completes regularly or the ways they reach out to customers.\n\nFinance KPI Report\n\nA finance KPI report tracks key financial performance indicators to measure an organization’s financial health. \n\nIt might feature these metrics, among others: \n\nNet profit margin\nLiquidity ratios \nReturn on investment \n\nIntegrate your report with tools like Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, or Excel.
