  "content": "What Is a Blog Post?\n\nA blog post is a piece of writing typically published on a website's blog that presents information, opinions, experiences, or insights on a particular topic. Blog posts vary in length. And can include text, images, or videos, depending on the topic.\n\nFor instance, travel blogs are often rich in visuals. Showcasing the beauty or uniqueness of the places described. \n\nLike this blog post from travel blog Nomadic Matt:\n\nBusiness blog posts tend to be text-heavy. Focusing on data, expert interviews, industry news, statistics, and other helpful insights. \n\nLike this blog post on Entrepreneur: \n\nWhat Is a Blog? \n\nA blog, or weblog, is a regularly updated website (or page on a website) that features blog posts on various topics. The content is usually written in a conversational style, addressing the reader directly.\n\nNote\n\nDepending on your goals, you can set up a standalone blog or integrate it into your website (e.g., https://www.myshop.com/blog/). The first option is more suitable if you plan to use your blog as an online journal or diary rather than a business tool.\n\nHow Does Blogging Benefit Your Business?\n\nBlogging has many potential benefits. Here, we look at the top advantages of creating blog posts for your business. \n\nBuilds Authority and Trust \n\nBlogging can be a powerful tool if you’re looking to establish authority in your industry. \n\nBy consistently creating valuable and informative content, you can demonstrate expertise. And engage with your audience in meaningful ways.\n\nHere's how blogging helps build authority:\n\nShowcases expertise: Blog posts that tackle industry issues, explain complex concepts, or provide how-to guides showcase your depth of knowledge. This helps position you as a thought leader in your industry. \nImproves SEO: Well-crafted blog posts that incorporate relevant keywords can improve a website's search engine rankings. Higher visibility in search results can lead to increased website traffic. And leads. \nBuilds trust: By providing valuable content without a hard sell, businesses can build trust with their audience \nGives You Full Control \n\nWith a blog, you have full control over the content you publish. Including the length, format, and topics you cover. \n\nBlogging platforms like Medium and social media sites like Facebook can remove content at any time. And for any reason. \n\nThis may happen if what you write goes against their guidelines, someone (such as a competitor) reports your posts, or the platform goes out of business.\n\nBuilds Internal Links\n\nAnother advantage of blogging is that it lets you build internal links, which can improve website navigation. Internal links connect various pages of your website, guiding customers through relevant content and product pages. \n\nA streamlined path makes it easier for customers to find and explore your products and other pages. \n\nLet's say you run an online store selling dietary supplements. You write about the benefits of protein on your blog. And link to product pages selling protein powder, protein bars, or other related products.\n\nIf your blog post is relevant and engaging, readers might click those links. And purchase the products you mentioned.\n\nImproves Traffic and Visibility \n\nIncorporating SEO best practices into your content may lead to higher rankings, resulting in more traffic and exposure. \n\nFor example, optimizing each blog post for specific keywords, such as \"whey protein powder\" or \"vegan protein bars,\" can help you get more targeted organic traffic. Keywords are search terms used by consumers to find information or products online.\n\nAdditionally, readers may share your blog posts on social media. Which can further boost website traffic and brand awareness.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to find top-performing search terms. Our tool can help you identify high-volume, low-competition keywords related to the topic you want to cover. \n\nIncreases Backlinks\n\nBlog posts are a great way to build backlinks for your website or blog. Backlinks are incoming links from one website to another, acting as votes of confidence that help signal your site's authority to search engines. \n\nHigh-quality backlinks can help boost your search engine rankings. And lead to more traffic. \n\nThe more traffic you get, the likelier your target audience is to discover your brand and products. Some may become paying customers. And help spread the word about your business.\n\nLets You Target Users in All Funnel Stages\n\nBlogging lets you create content for each stage of the marketing funnel. Which can help you attract, convert, and retain customers.\n\nHere’s a quick look at how to apply the marketing funnel to blog content: \n\nTop of the funnel (ToFu): Create how-to posts, listicles, infographics, and other types of content for new audiences. These people are just discovering your blog, products, or services. The goal is to build awareness of the problem you can solve. \nMiddle of the funnel (MoFu): Produce longer, more in-depth content, such as ultimate guides, case studies, and comparison posts, for readers who are already familiar with your business. At this point, you’ll want to generate interest in your offerings. \nBottom of the funnel (BoFu): Go into detail about the products or services you promote on your blog with detailed reviews and product demos. Your readers are ready to take the desired action (e.g., book a consultation)—they just need an extra push. \n\nFurther reading: ToFu, MoFu, BoFu: A Practical Guide to the Conversion Funnel\n\n6 Effective Blog Post Formats\n\nThere’s more than one way to format blog posts, depending on where your target audience is in the funnel. And your goals for the content. \n\nWith that in mind, let's see some of the most common types of blog posts.\n\n1. Listicles\n\nListicles are articles or blog posts organized in list format. \n\nFor example, a blog post titled “Top 10 Movies to Watch This Weekend” or “10 Must-Have Kitchen Appliances Every Home Needs” would be considered a listicle. \n\nUse listicles to break complex topics into smaller, more manageable chunks. And share tips, strategies, products, or ideas.\n\nFor instance, Healthline uses this format to cover complex topics in a clear and engaging manner. \n\nBelow, you can see a listicle blog post about health and nutrition, broken down into 27 tips.\n\nEach tip is numbered and covers one idea, such as \"Don't fear coffee” and \"Eat fatty fish.” \n\nListicles are easy to read and highly shareable. Which can help you reach a wider audience. As a result, they tend to attract more traffic and links, increasing your visibility online.\n\nPro tip\n\nWrite an odd or unusual number of list items, such as “37+ Side Hustles You Can Start Today” or “41 Examples of Blog Posts That Drive Engagement.” Using an odd number can draw readers' attention and set your content apart.\n\n2. \"How-To\" Blog Posts\n\nHow-to content provides actionable insights that help readers grasp complex concepts or learn something new. It may also answer common questions on a given topic or introduce new concepts.\n\nFor example, the following Shopify blog post shows readers how to start an online store.\n\nThe article consists of 10 steps that guide users through the process. From choosing a target audience to promoting their store.\n\nApartment Therapy published a short how-to post on how to clean a humidifier using only vinegar. \n\nThe content is broken down into five actionable steps. And includes relevant images.\n\nGenerally, how-to blog posts provide practical solutions. They're more hands-on compared to a case study, product review, or news article.\n\nIf readers find your content useful, they'll likely want more from you. This means they could browse your blog for further insights, join your email list, or follow your blog on social media.\n\n3. Checklists and Cheat Sheets\n\nChecklists and cheat sheets are an effective way to summarize information. While offering practical advice or solutions.\n\nThis type of content can also highlight key points or takeaways related to a broader topic. At the same time, it makes it easier to organize information, ideas, or concepts in a structured way.\n\nFor example, lifestyle blogger Joanna Goddard wrote a blog post called \"A Very Low-Key Summer Checklist.\" The article includes 10 fun, creative ideas for a memorable summer.\n\nUse checklists to present complex information in a simplified manner.\n\nFor instance, Net Solutions published a seven-step mobile app development checklist. This topic is broad and complex. But the article breaks it down into easy-to-follow steps.\n\nJust like listicles, checklists are user-friendly and highly shareable, allowing blog readers to grasp the main points quickly. \n\nAs a result, they can drive engagement. And help you get your message across more clearly.\n\n4. Ultimate Guides\n\nUltimate guides cover a topic in depth. These blog posts are often used as pillar content, serving as the foundation for other articles and resources on a website.\n\nUltimate guides are longer and more detailed than informational and how-to articles. But shorter than an ebook. They usually include lists, visuals, and multiple headings that make the content easier to digest.\n\nAn example is our \"Ultimate Guide to Content Marketing Strategy.\"\n\nIt begins with a definition of content marketing, explains why it's important, and then describes the steps involved in creating a strategy. \n\nIt also includes screenshots, images, real-world examples, and other resources on the topic.\n\nAnother example of an ultimate guide is the blog Under30Experiences. Which features a guide to traveling alone. \n\nThe blog post offers expert tips on how to plan your trip, stay safe, save money, and more.\n\nThis type of long-form content works best for broad or complex topics. If done right, it may increase blog traffic and brand authority. \n\nPlus, it allows you to position yourself as an industry expert. And build credibility for your business.\n\nPro tip\n\nCover what your competitors have missed. Browse their websites and blogs, read the comments, and look up the questions asked on Reddit, Quora, and other social media platforms. Based on this information, create original content that fills a gap in the market. And explores the topic from a fresh perspective.\n\n5. Reviews\n\nReviews revolve around the products or services you offer or have used. They should be relevant to your audience.\n\nFor example, if you have a blog about beauty and fashion, write about skincare products, makeup accessories, or clothing items.\n\nSee this example from Artistry Beauty, which features a review of The Ordinary’s hyaluronic acid product:\n\nA business blog might feature reviews of newly launched apps, software programs, or books. \n\nAs illustrated below:\n\nIf you sell a product or service, you may review other products or services that complement yours. For instance, a personal trainer could write about their experience with a particular protein brand or fitness center.\n\nWith this type of content, you provide value to your audience by introducing them to products and services they may need or want. \n\nIt's also an opportunity to target and rank for new keywords. Which can make your blog more discoverable in online searches.\n\nYour reviews may contain affiliate links to Amazon, ClickBank, or similar platforms. Affiliate links allow you to generate revenue every time someone purchases a product through your link.\n\nJust make sure you add a disclaimer (it’s a legal requirement) to inform readers about your relationship with the seller. \n\nAs shown below:\n\n6. Comparisons\n\nThis type of content is similar to review-style posts. But you'll compare two or more products.\n\nThe goal here is to highlight the similarities and differences between those products. As well as their distinct pros and cons.\n\nComparison guides can help your readers assess their options. And make an informed product decision. Plus, you may use them to show potential customers how your product or service measures against others.\n\nFor example, this blog post from Elegant Themes features a detailed comparison of AWeber and MailChimp:\n\nIt covers key features, usability, performance, and pricing options, among other aspects.\n\nThis format works for blogs in other niches, too.\n\nFor instance, lifestyle blogger Cassie Sethna wrote about the Dyson Airwrap versus the Revlon Styler. After testing both products, she published a short post about their pros and cons:\n\n6 Successful Blogs for Inspiration\n\nLearning from successful blogs is a great place to start. \n\nBelow, we cover six popular blogs—and what they do well—to inspire you. \n\n1. Semrush Blog\n\nAt Semrush, our blog posts guide readers through each step or process. Offering clear examples and definitions.\n\nMany posts are structured as ultimate guides. But you'll also find case studies, listicles, and shorter how-tos.\n\nWe also use engaging visuals to illustrate points, format for readability with short paragraphs and bullet lists, and use writers who are industry experts. \n\n2. Blogging Wizard\n\nThis award-winning blog features over 600 pieces of content. From product reviews and how-to posts to ultimate guides. \n\nIts clutter-free design and simple navigation allow readers to find the information they need easily.\n\nWhat makes it stand out is its step-by-step approach to a variety of subjects. The content is easy to digest. Making it suitable for novices and seasoned bloggers alike. \n\nThe blog also provides in-house research data, step-by-step tutorials, and content written by industry experts. The insights are fresh and actionable. Helping readers put into practice what they learn. \n\n3. Apartment Therapy\n\nApartment Therapy is a mix of educational articles, step-by-step guides, and news-style posts. There's also content related to daily life. Such as budgeting hacks and home financing tips.\n\nThis approach to blogging is effective because of its practicability. The content is clear and actionable. Offering easy-to-follow tips and real-world examples. \n\nHowever, it’s the visuals that really set Apartment Therapy’s blog posts apart from the competition. \n\nThe brand uses a blend of professional and amateur photos to showcase home interiors and decor. Giving their blog posts a relatable and authentic feel. \n\n4. Nomadic Matt\n\nNomadic Matt’s content covers hundreds of destinations around the world. And includes reviews of hotels, walking tours, and credit cards for frequent travelers.\n\nWhat makes the blog successful is how thorough it is. The content covers everything a traveler would want to know. How to plan trips, what to look for when booking hotels, and what to pack. \n\nMany posts also include detailed checklists. And original photos of cities, restaurants, and tourist attractions. \n\n5. James Clear\n\nJames Clear's lifestyle blog focuses on productivity and efficiency. Covering topics like how to retain more of every book you read or what to do when you feel like giving up.\n\nJames shares case studies and relatable, real-life examples. The content includes reputable research from neuroscience, psychology, and other fields. Which helps build authority and trustworthiness. \n\nThe entrepreneur also shares personal life lessons, motivation hacks, and self-improvement tips. Many posts are published in list format. But you'll also find checklists and how-to guides.\n\n6. What’s Gaby Cooking\n\nGaby Dalkin became one of the most popular food bloggers after launching What’s Gaby Cooking in 2009. Over the years, she turned her blog into a successful brand. Offering cooking products, recipe books, and meal plans.\n\nHer blog features over 1,100 delicious food recipes. As well as personal life posts, travel tips, gift guides, and cooking videos. \n\nThe tried-and-true recipes, personal photos, and helpful videos make Gaby’s blog a go-to resource for those looking for recipes. \n\nNote\n\nSome blogs also feature guest posts. These are articles published by other bloggers to gain exposure and backlinks. For instance, fitness professionals can write guest posts for health or lifestyle blogs to expand their reach.\n\nBlog Post Basics for Writers\n\nCrafting engaging blog posts takes practice and planning. Follow these basics to get started. \n\nResearch Relevant Blog Post Topics\n\nMost blogs cover a wide array of topics within specific categories. Like beauty, fitness, or tech. The challenge lies in finding interesting, relevant topics without repeating yourself.\n\nOne solution is to usethe Topic Research tool to generate blog post ideas.\n\nFirst, log in to your Semrush account. Click \"Topic Research\" under \"Content Marketing\" from the left-side navigation menu.\n\nNext, enter a broad topic into the search bar. Like strength training.\n\nType your term into the designated field. And choose your preferred country and language. \n\nPro tip\n\nRemove \"https:/\" and any trailing slashes (which can be found at the end of URLs, such as in “domain.com/”) when entering the domain name.\n\nWhen you're done, click \"Get content ideas.\"\n\nNote\n\nIf you don't have a Semrush account, you'll be redirected to a signup page after clicking \"Get content ideas.\"\n\nNext, you’ll see a list of blog topics.\n\nThe tool organizes topics by category. Select the category you're interested in and click \"Show more\" to see all the content ideas under that category.\n\nFor example, if you click \"Lifting Weights,\" you'll get multiple headlines and questions to address in your blog post.\n\nAlternatively, use Quora, Reddit, X (formerly known as Twitter), or Google Trends to explore content ideas. \n\nEnter your topic in the search bar to see what’s trending. And what people want to know about that topic.\n\nGet Blog Post Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nConduct Keyword Research \n\nOnce you've decided what you want to write about, search for keywords related to those topics.\n\nSay you plan to publish a blog post on how to travel on a budget.\n\nFirst, make a list of words and phrases related to this subject. Like \"travel for cheap,\" \"find cheap flights,\" \"save money on travel,” and \"best places to travel on a budget.\"\n\nNext, enter each term into the Keyword Magic Tool to get search data and related term suggestions. \n\nFrom here, filter and sort the results by search volume, keyword difficulty (how hard it is to rank for a given keyword), user intent (the purpose behind a search), and other criteria.\n\nChoose a primary keyword, such as \"best places to travel for cheap.” And several secondary keywords like \"travel hacks for cheap flights.\" \n\nUse your primary keyword in your blog post’s H1 (headline), body content, meta description, and title tag. \n\nCraft an Engaging Headline\n\nYour titles, or headlines, should spark curiosity. And resonate with the target audience.\n\nHere are some examples: \n\n\"The Unexpected Reason We Fail to Reach Our Goals\"\n\"Never Wear the Same Outfit Twice with This Hack\"\n\nBlog post titles may also contain numbers, quotes, or surprising facts. \n\nFor instance, you could write a headline that summarizes the findings of a study. \n\nLike the Foundation for Economic Education did with this post: \n\nYou can also use numbers. \n\nAccording to Semrush's Global State of Content Marketing Report, list-style headlines with numbers get more page views, backlinks, and shares than other types of headlines. \n\nFor example: \n\n\"10 Genius Ways to Use White Space in Design\"\n\"30 Healthy Food Recipes for Kids\"\n\"50 Fitness Bloggers You Should Follow on Twitter\"\nWrite a Catchy Introduction\n\nThe first few sentences of your blog post need to hook readers. And make them want to read more. \n\nMaybe it’s a question, relatable anecdote, or interesting fact. Keep your intro concise, tell readers what they’ll take away from your post, and pique their interest so they keep reading. \n\nConsider this example from Plytix’s blog, a product information management provider. \n\nThe introduction addresses an industry problem, provides a relevant stat, and builds excitement about a possible solution. All in just a few sentences.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse the SEO Writing Assistant (SWA) to fine-tune article introductions and body copy. Rephrase, simplify, expand, or summarize your content and get actionable tips on how to improve its readability. Track keyword usage as you write and get SEO recommendations. \n\nUse Subheadings\n\nUse multiple subheadings, like H2s and H3s. To organize your content and help readers skim. \n\nFrom a technical standpoint, subheadings are HTML elements. The H1 tag is the main heading, or blog post title. The other headings, like H2s, H3s, and H4s, break the content down into sections. \n\nThese HTML tags also help search engines understand what's on the page and improve accessibility.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse your target keyword in the H1 tag and at least one subheading. This practice can boost your SEO efforts. And make your content more discoverable in search results.\n\nAdd Engaging Visuals\n\nUse high-quality screenshots, infographics, photos, and videos in your blog posts. Visual content can summarize points, explain concepts or processes, and drive engagement.\n\nOur most recent Global State of Content Marketing Report found that blog posts and articles with at least seven images get the most page views, backlinks, and shares. \n\nGenerally, it’s best to use one image every 150 to 300 words or so.\n\nFor example, if you're writing a blog post about at-home workouts, add an image or video for each exercise you mention.\n\nThis example from Nerd Fitness shows how the brand uses video and GIFs to demonstrate different types of squats. \n\nWrite High-Quality Body Content\n\nTo write high-quality blog post content that resonates with your audience and ranks well on search engines, you’ll want to focus on several key elements:\n\nConduct competitor analysis: Analyze the top-ranking content for your chosen keywords. Look at the topics they cover, the depth of their content, and how they structure their information. Identify gaps in their content that you can fill by using Keyword Gap.\nCreate in-depth content: Go beyond surface-level information. Dive deep into your topic to provide valuable insights that aren't readily available elsewhere. This often means writing longer posts. But always prioritize quality and relevance.\nIncorporate expert quotes and stats: Adding original quotes from industry experts and relevant statistics can bolster your post's credibility. Reach out to experts for comments using a tool like Help a Reporter Out (HARO) or curate insights from reputable sources. Ensure any data is up-to-date and accurately cited.\nProvide actionable tips: Give readers clear, actionable advice they can implement. Practical tips are valuable and can encourage readers to return to your blog for more.\nEdit and proofread: Ensure your content is free of grammatical errors and typos. Well-edited content reflects professionalism and care.\n\nFurther reading: What Is Quality Content & How to Create It\n\nIncorporate E-E-A-T Signals \n\nGoogle has guidelines for creating people-first content. And incorporating what the search engine calls “E-E-A-T” into your blog posts. \n\nE-E-A-T stands for:\n\nExperience\nExpertise\nAuthoritativeness\nTrustworthiness\n\nYour blog posts should demonstrate your experience and expertise. Highlight your background, industry experience, and past jobs, awards, and more in your author bio. \n\nInclude expert quotes from industry leaders in your content. Consider having experts review your blog posts to ensure accuracy. \n\nThis is especially crucial for YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) topics like health, finances, or personal safety. \n\nLet's say you're writing about the best products for a good night's sleep. \n\nShare your personal experience using or testing the products. Quote or reference sleep experts and other professionals to back up your statements. If possible, link to relevant studies on the products. Include customer reviews and testimonials to build trust. \n\nTest Different Lengths \n\nA blog post may be as short as 500 words. Or, as long as 5,000 words. The ideal length depends on the topic. And your audience's needs.\n\nCreate a mix of content using different formats and lengths to see what works best for your audience. \n\nFurther reading: Short-Form vs. Long-Form Content (Which One Do I Use and When?)\n\nFormat for Readability \n\nHow you format your blog posts matters. \n\nPeople tend to skim online content. And read content on mobile devices. \n\nUse these formatting tips to improve readability. And keep readers engaged:\n\nMake your content skimmable with subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists\nBold or italicize key points, tips, and other important information\nInclude images or videos to provide visual breaks \nStick to one idea per paragraph to convey your message more effectively\nPut the most important information at the beginning of each section or paragraph\nAdd a table of contents for longer posts so readers can jump to sections\nUse block quotes to emphasize key takeaways or interesting ideas\nOpt for easy-to-read fonts like Open Sans, Arial, Georgia, or Montserrat \nLimit paragraphs to three to four sentences \n\nAnother way to keep readers engaged is by using bucket brigades or “bridge” phrases. \n\nIn the example below, we used the phrase “Wait! Let me explain” to improve the flow of writing. And engage the reader. \n\nFurther reading: 5 Time-Tested Blog Post Templates for Compelling Content\n\nInclude a Strong Call-to-Action\n\nInclude a call-to-action (CTA) at the end of each blog post. To encourage readers to take the desired action.\n\nYour CTA should be clear, concise, and actionable. It should also clearly describe the benefit for readers. \n\nIn this example from Nomadic Matt, the benefit is clear: Readers will learn how to pay less for travel. And which credit cards will earn the most miles. \n\nThe bold CTA of “Get the Guide” encourages readers to enter their information to access the helpful content. \n\nPro tip\n\nUse action verbs like \"Act,\" “Start,” and \"Subscribe\" to make your CTAs more effective.\n\nBoost Your Blogging Efforts with Semrush\n\nNo matter the type of blog content you create, coming up with fresh topics can be challenging. \n\nTopic Research can make your job easier.
