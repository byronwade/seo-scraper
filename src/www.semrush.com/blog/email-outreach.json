  "content": "Email outreach is a tried-and-tested way to build backlinks, land coverage from bloggers and journalists, and improve your brand authority.\n\nBut there’s a lot more to it than simply putting together a quick email and sending it out.\n\nIn this guide, we’re going to walk you through the email outreach process from start to finish.\n\nTip: Want to get stuck straight in? Semrush’s Link Building Tool helps you find prospects, create and send outreach emails, and monitor your link building progress. And you can try it for free.\n\nWhat Is Email Outreach?\n\nEmail outreach is the process of reaching out to influencers via email to get backlinks, promote content, or form a partnership. Generally, the idea is to find people who might link to your content (link building prospects), then reach out to put forward your proposal.\n\nIt might sound simple, but there’s more to outreach than first meets the eye.\n\nIn fact, the reason why many email outreach campaigns fail is that there’s not a solid process in place—one that sets it up for success. \n\nBut it’s also no secret that outreach is widely misunderstood. And often gets a bad reputation for the wrong reasons.\n\nOutreach emails are often considered to be spam by recipients because so many marketers fail to put this solid process in place. Instead, they blindly send emails to as many people as they can, regardless of whether or not they’re likely to be interested.\n\nAnd that’s totally the wrong approach to take. \n\nEmail outreach is not spam. It’s all about carefully prospecting people who may genuinely find your content useful. Then sharing it and asking them to take action if they like what they see.\n\nBut so many get this wrong, and many of us have been on the receiving end of a bad outreach email.\n\nFor example, take a look at the below:\n\nThis was an outreach email sent to a children’s toy retailer. But it was sent by a company asking for a link to one of their marketing and SEO posts. \n\nIt’s no wonder that outreach gets a bad reputation when emails like this are sent to businesses. \n\nFor starters, asking a children's toy retailer to link to an article about marketing makes no sense. Especially given that they’re asking for this from an article about Disney. \n\nAnd secondly, a link back to this company from a marketing blog makes just as little sense.\n\nThis is a clear example of outreach done wrong and a demonstration of what not to do. \n\nWhy Is Email Outreach Important in Link Building?\n\nEmail outreach is important in link building because it gets your content in front of potential influencers. And encourages them to amplify it.\n\nAnyone experienced in link building will tell you that a “build it and they will come” approach rarely works. For the best results, you must be proactive.\n\nIn other words, build relationships with prospects and make them aware of your content. To stand a better chance of securing backlinks that benefit your SEO. And earning valuable brand exposure.\n\nHere are some other benefits of email outreach: \n\nIt can scale up to help you to close a link gap with competitors\nYou can pursue links and coverage on target publications\nYou can build authority around specific topics and pages\n\nEmail outreach can (and generally should) be used alongside other link building tactics, such as:\n\nGuest blogging\nSkyscraper technique\nBroken link building\nDigital PR \n\nIt’s a skill that can supercharge your link building efforts and help you to execute a solid strategy that drives success. \n\nTo most SEOs, there is no other link building tactic that compares to email outreach. \n\nThe Golden Rules of Outreach\n\nTo see success from your outreach efforts, there are a number of golden rules that you need to follow. These are:\n\nFocus on Prospect Quality Over Quantity\n\nFocus your efforts on people who might have a genuine interest in linking to your content.\n\nDon’t just send to as many people as possible in the hopes that some will link. This can lead to your emails being flagged as spam. And earn your brand a bad reputation.\n\nExplain What’s in It for Them\n\nYour email outreach should clearly demonstrate how your content adds value to the person that you are reaching out to and their audience. \n\nIf you can’t explain what’s in it for the prospect, avoid contacting them.\n\nClearly Communicate Your Request\n\nIf a recipient cannot clearly understand what you want them to do upon receiving your email, you need to make sure this is communicated better. \n\nAlways be clear on what action you want the recipient to take. But don’t be too demanding.\n\nDon’t Pay for Links\n\nGoogle’s link spam policies state that publishers should not buy links for SEO purposes.\n\nIf you pay for a link placement or make some other exchange, the link should be “nofollowed.” \n\nIn other words, the prospect should add the rel=\"nofollow\" or rel=\"sponsored\" attribute value to the <a> tag. To tell Google that the link should not count towards rankings.\n\nLike this:\n\n<a href=\"https://apple.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple</a>\nHave Something Worth Sharing\n\nIf you want to earn great links with outreach, you need something worth linking to—a linkable asset. Also known as link bait.\n\nLinkable assets can include:\n\nOriginal research \nTools \nBlog posts\nInfographics\nVideos\nInteractive content\nProducts\n\nYou can have the best idea or pitch in the world, but if there’s nothing to link to, you may only be credited with a brand mention.\n\nFor example, if you’re sharing insights from one of your team members, make sure there’s a corresponding blog post the publisher can link to. Or they might not bother linking.\n\nAnd before producing something new, remember to make the most of existing content. Most businesses already have something that deserves to be promoted and properly distributed. \n\nSet Goals\n\nSet goals for your outreach efforts so that you can measure how successful your approach is and make improvements.\n\nIf you do not have a goal, how can you determine whether or not your resources were well spent? \n\nThe mistake that many marketers make is using the number of links earned as a standalone goal. For example, “earn links from 10 unique domains per month.”\n\nProblem is, this doesn’t take the quality of links into account. And the quality of the site plays a significant role in your brand, traffic, and SEO results.\n\nHere are some other metrics to consider in email outreach campaigns:\n\nThe authority of the linking site and page (use Authority Score as a guide)\nThe topical relevance of the linking site and page\nWhether the domain already links to a competitor\nReferral traffic from earned links\nKeyword rankings (although attributing improvements to links can be tricky)\nThe link destination and anchor text, and how these contribute to wider marketing goals\n\nTherefore, an example of a solid outreach goal could be to earn links on high-authority sites that already link to competitors. And increase referral traffic to 1,000 visits per month.\n\nTo learn more about what makes a good backlink, check out our guide on backlink analysis.\n\nHow to Identify Outreach Prospects\n\nIf you want your email outreach campaign to be successful, you need to contact prospects who are interested in what you have to offer. And likely to take action.\n\nThere are a few different ways to do this, depending on the goal of your outreach and the specific tactics you’re using.\n\nLet’s explore seven different methods:\n\nDo a Backlink Gap Analysis\n\nA backlink gap analysis involves looking at your competitors’ backlink profiles to see who links to their site but not yours. This is one of the quickest and easiest ways to build a prospect list.\n\nTry it out with Semrush’s Backlink Gap tool.\n\nEnter your domain and up to four competitors’ domains. Then, click “Find prospects.”\n\nThe tool shows your “Best” prospects by default. These are sites that link to all your competitors but not to you.\n\nClick the arrow alongside rivals’ link numbers to see more detail:\n\nUse the check boxes and “Export” button to save your favorite prospects in a spreadsheet.\n\nOr, click “+ Start outreach” to send them to Semrush’s Link Building Tool. From there, you can find email addresses, send emails, and monitor your email outreach campaign.\n\nDiscover Backlink Opportunities\n\nwith the Backlink Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUse Semrush’s Link Building Tool\n\nSemrush’s Link Building Tool finds outreach prospects based on your competitors and target keywords.\n\nAfter setting up, go to the “Prospects” tab. \n\nYou’ll find a list of sites that might link to yours. Along with useful data, including:\n\nURL Type: What context the example backlink appears in\nAS: Authority Score, a measure of site authority\nRating: A measure of the site’s authority and accessibility\n\nWhen you’re ready to start email outreach, click “To In Progress.”\n\nThe prospect will move to the “In Progress” tab. \n\nFrom here, you can access useful data, send outreach emails, and much more.\n\nBuild Backlinks Easily\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nSearch Google News\n\nNews publishers can make good link building prospects. As long as they cover stories in your niche.\n\nTo find them, search a relevant topic in Google.\n\nThen, go to the “News” tab. \n\nTo broaden your results, go to “Tools.” \n\nThen, switch “Recent” to “Past month” or another time range.\n\nAdd publications and journalists who have recently covered relevant topics to your outreach list. \n\nMonitor Your Unlinked Mentions\n\nAn unlinked mention or brand mention occurs when a website references your brand but doesn’t link to your site.\n\nFor example:\n\nUnlinked mentions are relatively easy to convert into links. As the site has already expressed an interest in your brand. And adding a link is pretty straightforward.\n\nYou can check your mentions in the Brand Monitoring app.\n\nClick “Filters” > “Article backlinks” > “Without backlinks” > “Save” to filter for unlinked mentions.\n\nAnd make sure to check their sentiment. Positive mentions are generally easier (and more valuable) to convert.\n\nAnother app that can find unlinked mentions of your brand is Media Monitoring (found in the Semrush App Center).\n\nWith this app you can track your brand mentions across the web, and hone in on positive and negative sentiments.\n\nThis allows you to pick out the positive mentions for links and consider addressing the negative ones to help your online reputation.\n\nReach Out to Those Mentioned in Your Content \n\nAn easy place to start is with your existing website content. \n\nFor example, if you have a blog post that mentions experts in your field or quotes reputable websites, you can reach out to them, letting them know that you’ve mentioned them on your site. In return, they could be enticed to link to that resource. \n\nThe Mentioned - Outreach Wizard app in the Semrush App Center makes this process simple. \n\nUsing this app, you can just enter a URL of a post and the app will automatically scan the page content for contacts that are mentioned in the post. \n\nAfter scanning, you’ll see the contacts the app found. \n\nThen, if you want to reach out to one of them, it will find their email address and give you an outreach email template to send them a message about the post. \n\nThis app also offers helpful tools for finding & verifying email addresses if you just have the name and website of someone you’re looking to reach out to. \n\nUse Google Search Operators\n\nGoogle search operators are commands that help you refine your Google searches. So, they can make it easier to find outreach prospects.\n\nFor example, you can use the “inurl:” search operator to find sites in your niche that accept guest post submissions.\n\nLike this:\n\nRead our Google search operators guide to familiarize yourself with the various commands and use them in your email outreach efforts.\n\nUse a Media Database\n\nMedia databases are like search engines for media contacts (i.e., journalists and bloggers).\n\nWith Prowly, you get access to over 1 million contacts. And you can search by keyword or topic:\n\nIf you want, you can filter results by language, location, and more:\n\nSo, don’t just use media databases to find email addresses of pre-defined contacts. Use them to surface relevant prospects in your niche.\n\nThese platforms typically come with a monthly or yearly subscription fee.\n\nBut, they can save you a lot of time. And give you access to information that isn’t available elsewhere.\n\nHow to Find Email Addresses\n\nIf you decide to invest in a media database, this should help you find the right email address for your outreach prospect.\n\nBut if you don’t use one, what are your options?\n\nFirst, try looking at the person’s public profiles (e.g., their author bio page and LinkedIn profile). To see if their email address is listed.\n\nLike this:\n\nIf you haven’t identified a specific contact yet, see if the company has a “meet the team” page. And look for the relevant decision-maker.\n\nOr, there might be a “write for us” page. With an email address or contact form.\n\nHere’s an example from Rolling Stone:\n\nAs a last resort, test common email address combinations. Like firstname.lastname@domain.com.\n\nHowever, whatever method you choose for sourcing email addresses, make sure to verify them through an email verification tool. Your outreach message can be perfect, but you need to make sure it reaches the person’s inbox and doesn’t get cracked in a spam folder along the way.\n\nIf you have an email address for someone else at the company, use that as a template.\n\nHow to Write an Outreach Email\n\nPoorly written emails that don’t evoke any sort of action are one of the most common reasons why outreach is unsuccessful.\n\nAnd it makes absolute sense. After all, we are all short of time, and emails are often only skimmed at the best of times. \n\nHere’s how to write an outreach email that convinces the recipient to take action:\n\nWrite a Great Subject Line\n\nThe subject line of your outreach email is what entices a recipient to open it. And if no one opens your emails, they’re not going to see your outreach pitch.\n\nIf they’re not reading your pitch, they will not see your content. Which means that they’re not going to link to it.\n\nHere are some tips for writing an attention-grabbing subject line:\n\nMention the format of your content (e.g., “[Infographic]”)\nInclude your main hook (e.g., an interesting statistic)\nSummarize your proposal (e.g., “There’s a broken link on your site”)\n\nIt’s a good idea to try different types of subject lines and see which get the best open rates. Use split testing for the most reliable results.\n\nBe Upfront\n\nClearly share what you’re pitching, whether that’s a story, a product, or even a replacement for a broken link. Make it clear early on in the email so that there is no confusion about what you are asking someone to read. \n\nBy doing this, you are allowing the recipient to quickly make a decision on whether or not to continue reading while having a good idea of what is coming.\n\nPersonalize Your Email\n\nAddress the recipient by name. And explain why you’re sending this outreach email to this specific person.\n\nFor example, you might refer to a recent article they wrote on a similar topic.\n\nEveryone wants to feel that they have been carefully chosen and haven’t just been added to a mass communication list. \n\nMake Your Request Clear\n\nShare the action that you want the person to take and don’t leave them guessing. If you want them to cover your content in a news article they’re writing, say that. Likewise, if you want a brand mention turned into a link, be clear.\n\nYou’ll find this far more effective than leaving someone guessing about what you want them to do.\n\nBut the good news is that you can often template some of your outreach emails, at least to a certain degree, to help speed up the process. \n\nCreate your own templates in Semrush’s Link Building Tool:\n\nLook at Email Outreach Examples\n\nLooking at email outreach examples is one of the best ways to learn what’s effective.\n\nTake the broken link building email below. It demonstrates how you can write a compelling email while remaining concise:\n\nHi Michael,\n\nI noticed your Dunder Mifflin article “How to Make Your Office More Economical” contains a broken link.\n\nLooks like EcoMag deleted their paper recycling report, as the URL brings up a 404 error.\n\nIf you’re looking for an alternative, we’ve just published a new paper waste report here at WasteCo.\n\nWe found that offices recycle just 40% of paper on average!\n\nKind regards,\n\nLesley\n\nFor more inspiration, check out our cold email templates.\n\nHow to Send Outreach Emails\n\nWhile there’s nothing wrong with sending outreach emails straight from your email client, this can make it hard to track the progress of each pitch.\n\nTry setting up a spreadsheet to monitor each email. \n\nOr, send your outreach emails through Semrush’s Link Building Tool. \n\nYou can see whether emails have been delivered, opened, replied to, or auto-replied to at a glance.\n\nPlus, the tool will automatically track whether you’ve received a link. \n\nIf so, move the prospect to the “Monitor” tab. Where you can ensure your link remains active.\n\nFollowing Up on Outreach Emails\n\nFollow up on outreach emails if you don’t get a reply within a week or so.\n\nInboxes are busy places, and emails get missed. \n\nIf someone doesn’t respond to your first email or add a link to your site, it doesn’t mean they’re not interested in your proposal. It might just mean they haven’t seen it, haven't had a chance to do anything with it, or simply got sidetracked.\n\nFor these reasons, we recommend following up at least once (but never more than twice) on your first outreach email. \n\nThe Link Building Tool automatically flags emails that haven’t received a response in seven days:\n\nWe recommend that you follow up in the same email thread. A simple check-in will suffice.\n\nIf you receive a response from a prospect, try to reply as soon as possible. Writers often work on tight deadlines, so your response time can significantly impact your success rate.\n\nAnd use your judgment when following up. Always be friendly and undemanding.\n\nYou don’t want to be the type of marketer that journalists complain about.\n\nSource:\n@LottieCGross on Twitter\nWhy Emails Go Ignored\n\nOnly 8.5% of outreach emails receive a response, according to Backlinko. \n\nHere are some common reasons that outreach emails get ignored:\n\nYour subject line is spammy or unappealing\nThe prospect is not a right fit for your content\nYou don’t tell the prospect what’s in it for them\nYour outreach email is too long or unclear\nYour email or approach is unprofessional\nYour content does not meet the prospect’s standards\n\nSo, as well as perfecting your email outreach campaign, you need to create quality content. \n\nSemrush’s digital marketing toolkit can help you with both.\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
