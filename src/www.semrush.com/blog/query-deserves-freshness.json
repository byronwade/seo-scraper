  "content": "What Is Query Deserves Freshness? \n\nQuery deserves freshness (QDF) is a part of Google’s algorithm that prioritizes newer content in search results when a searched topic is trending, rapidly evolving, or changing over time.\n\nIt was introduced as a model that can determine when there’s demand for fresh information.\n\nFor example, QDF may elevate articles published in the past few hours or minutes when queries are related to breaking news stories. \n\nLike this:\n\nQDF actually predates the Google freshness algorithm update that occurred in 2011. \n\nThe freshness algorithm aims to better decide when to provide particularly timely content. And does that by determining when queries are related to news/trending topics, regularly recurring events, and information that frequently changes.\n\nOne example is that people searching for the “best laptops” get reviews of modern models:\n\nHow Does QDF Work?\n\nQDF works by determining if publishers and searchers are more interested in a topic than usual.\n\nIf lots of articles are being published and there’s also a spike in searches, it suggests the topic is trending. And Google prioritizes fresh content.\n\nGoogle’s then head of search, Amit Singhal, said in a 2007 interview with The New York Times:\n\nThe QDF solution revolves around determining whether a topic is ‘hot.’ If news sites or blog posts are actively writing about a topic, the model figures that it is one for which users are more likely to want current information. The model also examines Google’s own stream of billions of search queries.\n\nGoogle can tell when an article was published/updated by looking at various signals.\n\nBut freshness isn’t the only thing that influences rankings.\n\nOther factors, such as the site’s trustworthiness, still matter.\n\nTip\n\nSemrush’s Authority Score metric can help you assess how reputable your site likely appears to search engines (the higher the score, the better). Check yours using Backlink Analytics.\n \n\nHow to Optimize for QDF\n\nOptimizing for QDF can help your news-related content rank highly. \n\nHere are some tips for success:\n\nApply SEO best practices to your site and content\nMonitor Google Trends to identify relevant search trends you might want to cover\nTry to publish time-sensitive content quickly—without sacrificing quality\nUse Google News SEO tactics to increase your chance of appearing across Google properties where news stories appear\nAdd schema markup to help Google better understand your articles\nOptimize your crawl budget to ensure Google crawls your new content quickly\nFollow Google’s guidelines for news publishers\n\nBut keep in mind that freshness matters for some non-news queries as well. So, it’s always a good idea to make sure any potentially time-sensitive content is up to date and optimized for SEO.\n\nMake Your Entire Site More Search-Friendly\n\nWhether the query deserves freshness or not, SEO can help you get higher rankings for relevant search terms in Google.\n\nAnd Semrush has all the tools you need to succeed.\n\nCreate your free account to conduct keyword research, check your site for technical errors, create search-optimized content, and much more.\n\nIncrease Your Google Visibility\n\nwith Semrush’s SEO Tools\n\nCreate Free Account →",
