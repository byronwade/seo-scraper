  "content": "Using a customer profile helps you identify the right marketing channels, refine your brand message, and build strong customer relationships.\n\nHere, we’ll show you how to create a stand-out customer profile. And give you access to our free customer profile templates.\n\nBut let’s start with some basics.\n\nTip: You can skip ahead to download our customer profile templates. And then follow along.\n\nWhat Is a Customer Profile?\n\nA customer profile (sometimes called a consumer profile, buyer persona, or client profile) is a detailed description of the ideal person who would buy from your business. \n\nThat can include where they live, what their job title is, and which social media platforms they use in their spare time. \n\nSolid data (from market research you conduct) is the cornerstone of a good customer profile. \n\nWe’ll discuss some ways you can get the right data to create your customer profile later in this article.\n\nBenefits of Creating Customer Profiles\n\nCustomer profiles help you better understand the people most likely to buy your products or services. So you can sell to them more easily.\n\nAnd going after a targeted group of customers ensures you don’t waste money trying to appeal to the wrong people. \n\nFor example, if your company sells a workplace collaboration platform, you want to target the decision-maker rather than the employees that would use the software. Which increases the chances of making a sale.\n\nWith customer profiles, you can:\n\nDeliver relevant messaging to people most likely to make a purchase\nCreate relevant and impactful content that resonates with prospective customers\nStandardize how different departments engage with your target audience to provide a consistent user experience\nProvide better customer service, increasing loyalty and sales\nKey Elements of a Customer Profile\n\nThere are some essential components that make up a comprehensive customer profile. Let’s look at them in more detail.\n\nDemographic Information\n\nDemographic data is your ideal customers’ measurable characteristics. It’s valuable to include in a customer profile because it helps you quickly get a snapshot of who your key customers are. \n\nDemographic information can include:\n\nAge\nGender\nJob title and place of work—you might want to expand on this with more information about the company your ideal customers work for if you’re in a B2B industry\nEducation level\nFamily status (e.g., whether they’re married or have pets or children)\nIncome\n\nDemographic information can tell you a lot about a specific target audience and how you should sell to them. \n\nFor example, web developers who are men in their mid-20s will need to be marketed to differently than women in their early 40s who are teachers.\n\nHere’s a snapshot of what demographic information might look like in a customer profile:\n\nPsychographic Information\n\nPsychographic data is information that helps you understand the way your ideal customers think and feel. And helps reveal customers’ pain points and how your product or service can benefit them.\n\nPsychographic information can include:\n\nHobbies and interests\nPersonality traits\nCore values\nPolitical and religious views\n\nLet’s revisit the example of the male web developers compared to female teachers we mentioned earlier. \n\nPerhaps the teachers are interested in rock climbing, soccer, and other physical activities. And the developers may prefer to play computer games in their spare time. \n\nBoth groups may respond to your businesses’ messaging in different ways.\n\nHere’s a look at how you can apply psychographic information to a profile:\n\nBehavioral Information\n\nBehavioral data helps you understand the buying habits of your ideal customers. \n\nBehavioral information can include::\n\nHow the customer engages with brands (like via social media)\nWhat similar and complementary products the customer has bought before\nWhat the customer looks for when purchasing a product or service (e.g., good value, high quality)\nHow long they remain loyal to a brand\nWhat causes them to stop buying a product or service\n\nBehavioral and psychographic data go hand in hand. \n\nPsychographic data tells you what compels customers to buy. And behavioral data reveals how they make buying decisions.\n\nThe image below shows how you could use behavioral information to inform a customer profile:\n\nGeographic Information\n\nGeographic information conveys where your ideal customers are and where they buy. And what types of location-specific elements you might need to keep in mind.\n\nGeographic data can include:\n\nCountry\nState\nCity\nLanguage\nCultural norms\n\nFor example, if you operate a clothing store, you can use the location of your target customer to help identify if they prefer warm-weather clothing, cold-weather clothing, or a combination of the two. \n\nHere’s how you can use that information in your ideal customer profile.\n\nHow to Create a Customer Profile in 4 Steps\n\nHere’s our four-step guide to building a customer profile that provides value to your business:\n\n1. Gain a Deep Understanding Your Product or Service and Current Customers\n\nThe first step is to thoroughly understand your product or service. Including how it’s used, what feedback current customers have provided, and more.\n\nStart by identifying the key features of your product or service. This might entail talking to members of your product or development team.\n\nThen, dig into how your current customers go through the buyer’s journey. Your customer relationship management (CRM) system is an excellent source of this type of information. \n\nAnd make note of any pain points they experience. Speaking to your customer support and sales teams can be a huge help for this.\n\nYou can also learn more about your existing customers through Google Analytics and social media analytics tools (you can see a report from Semrush’s Social Analytics below).\n\nYou can even consider distributing surveys and feedback forms to customers to gather direct feedback.\n\nAll of this information will help you better understand your product or service. Which can influence how you message it to prospective customers. \n\n2. Gather Data on Your Ideal Customers\n\nIt’s essential to gather data on your ideal customers. Because they may be different from your current customers.\n\nThe best way to do this is through market research.\n\nYou can do this research with both primary and secondary sources.\n\nWhichever option you choose, it’s important to gather data objectively to avoid confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is when you seek out data that aligns with your pre-existing thoughts and beliefs. Which can skew your results.\n\nPrimary Research\n\nPrimary market research is research you conduct yourself. Or that a third party (like a research agency) carries out on your behalf. \n\nInterviews, surveys, and focus groups are all examples of primary research. For example, we distributed a survey to conduct primary research for our State of Content Marketing report.\n\nPrimary research is great because you can customize it to your requirements. But it can be expensive and time-consuming to gather.\n\nSecondary Research\n\nSecondary research is research gathered by someone else. \n\nThat can include reviewing books, competitors’ websites, white papers, and government reports.\n\nSecondary research is easier to find than primary research. But it’s less specific to your needs.\n\nMarket Explorer can also be useful for doing this type of research. Which you can use to create your customer profiles. \n\nOpen the tool and select “Analyze Category” to choose your target market. (You can also select “Create a List” if you want to do market research based on some specific competitors.)\n\nAnd click “Research a market.”\n\nYou’ll first see the “Overview” report. Which provides information about the overall market size, the degree of consolidation, and some of the main competitors.\n\nNow, click the “Audience” tab. To see data on the market’s demographics, socioeconomic information, preferred social media platforms, and more.\n\nAll this information can help you gain a deep understanding of the market. And what to include in your customer profiles. \n\nLearn About Your Ideal Customers\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Analyze and Identify the Most Important Elements\n\nIt’s now time to analyze your customer data and determine which information you want to include in your customer profile.\n\nWhen creating a customer profile, we recommend including the following (at a minimum):\n\nAge\nJob title\nFamily status\nPain points\nMotivations to buy\nFactors that influence buying decisions\n\nBut the exact information you include depends on your business, your product or service, and the industry you work in. \n\nFor example, if you’re creating a B2B customer profile template, you may want to include additional information about the type of business your target customer works at. And details about their industry experience (like in the below example).\n\nYou don’t want to include every piece of information about your ideal customer. Because an overly long consumer profile can be hard to read and follow. \n\nChoose the elements that are most important for helping you reach your business goals.\n\n4. Build Your Customer Profile\n\nThe final step is actually building your customer profile.\n\nYou can do this by creating a simple customer profile template in Microsoft Word or Google Docs (like the templates we’re sharing in the next section). \n\nOr use a graphic design package like Canva or Photoshop. A visually driven customer profile template can be an excellent opportunity to use your logo and colors, reinforcing your brand identity.\n\nHere are some more tips for creating your profiles:\n\nSplit your data into the four main categories: demographic, psychographic, behavioral, and geographic. To make it easier to present your data in your template.\nKeep your template clean and simple. Use headings and space between sections so it’s easy to understand.\nPut the most important information (like demographic information) at the top of the customer profile. So team members can get the data they need at a glance.\nUse quotes from existing customers (from reviews or surveys) that you think can represent your ideal customers well. To add realism and inspire narratives.\nCreate multiple customer profiles to speak to each of your target audiences.\nAsk your team for feedback to ensure your profiles are complete and easy to read.\nReview and update your client profiles regularly so they’re always up to date.\nPut your customer profiles in a file location and format that anyone on your team can access as needed. Google Drive is great for storing your customer profiles so your team can view them from anywhere.\nHow Using a Customer Profile Template Can Help You\n\nUsing a customer profile template can have many advantages. \n\nThey:\n\nProvide guidance about what information to gather so no one on your team makes mistakes\nSave time and resources because you don’t have to create a new customer profile from scratch each time\nEnsure consistency, so you can easily compare different profiles\n3 Customer Profile Templates You Can Use\n\nHere are some customer profile template examples to inspire you.\n\nBasic Customer Profile Template\n\nThis customer profile template sticks to the most important details.

Because it:\n\nPersonalizes them, which makes it easier for you to empathize with their needs\nMakes it easier to reference them in conversation. For example, you can say, “How would Leo respond to this advertisement?” \nReduces confusion if your business has multiple customer profiles\n\nYou can also include a stock photo representing your customer profile. And even a quote from a real customer to bring the profile to life.\n\nKeep Your Customer Profile Up to Date\n\nIt’s vital to regularly review and update your client profile to make sure you’re always targeting the right people.\n\nWe recommend revisiting your profile at least once a year. And sooner if your product or service offering changes.\n\nConsider setting a reminder like this in Google Calendar:\n\nCreate a Negative Customer Profile\n\nNegative customer profiles (or exclusionary profiles) represent the customers who are least likely to buy from you.\n\nThese profiles can help you avoid wasting time marketing to the wrong people. And help you better understand your ideal customers.\n\nShare Your Profile with Everyone\n\nYou should share your client profile with other departments, especially if they frequently interact with your customers.\n\nHere’s a look at how different teams can use them:\n\nSales can use customer profiles to better understand the prospects and leads they’re connecting with\nMarketing can use customer profiles to develop targeted content and campaigns\nCustomer support can use customer profiles to better understand key issues customers are likely to face\nProduct development can use customer profiles to improve existing products\n\nIf you partner with other businesses like digital marketing agencies, share your customer profiles with them, too. To help them understand your target audiences better.\n\nLeverage Customer Profiles for Business Success\n\nCreating customer profiles is invaluable for defining the audiences most likely to buy from your business.\n\nAnd they help steer your sales and marketing teams.\n\nThe key to a great customer profile is including the right data. \n\nStart gathering information about your ideal customers with Market Explorer. \n\nLearn About Your Ideal Customers\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
