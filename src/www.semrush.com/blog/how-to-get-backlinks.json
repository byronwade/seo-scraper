  "content": "Backlinks are links to your website from other websites. And backlinks from reputable and relevant sites can boost your search engine rankings.\n\nIn this post, you’ll learn how to get backlinks that drive results. \n\nLet’s dive in.\n\n1. Ask Creators to Fix Your Broken Backlinks\n\nOne of the easiest and most effective ways to get backlinks is to find broken backlinks to your site (e.g., backlinks to your deleted pages). And ask the creators to fix them.\n\nThey’re likely to accept your request. Because no one wants broken links on their website. And they intended to link to you in the first place.\n\nYou can find your broken backlinks with Semrush’s Backlink Audit tool.\n\nAfter setting up, go to the “Target Pages” report and check the box beside “Target URL error.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of broken URLs on your domain. \n\nFind a URL that you have a good replacement for. Then click the number in the “Active” column to view its active backlinks.\n\nTip\n\nNot sure what the page used to show? Search the URL on the Wayback Machine to see what used to be on the page. \n\nFrom here, you can learn more about the backlinks. And click through to the source pages.\n\nJudge which backlink opportunities are worth pursuing. Based on: \n\nThe quality of the page: Links from poor-quality pages can do more harm than good. So they may not be worth pursuing.\nThe nature of the content: For example, admins are unlikely to update archived content\nThe context of the backlink: For example, is your content framed in a positive light?\n\nIf an opportunity is worth pursuing, find the email address of a relevant contact.\n\nAnd send them a concise, friendly message like this:\n\nSubject: Broken link on your page\n\nHi [Article Writer],\n\nI noticed that your page [URL] contains a broken link to our website.\n\nCould you please update this with a link to [new URL]?\n\nBest,\n\n[Your Email Signature]\n\nFollow up as needed. And keep note of your results for future reference.\n\nThen, repeat until you’ve obtained as many backlinks as possible.\n\nStart Building Links\n\nwith Your Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →\n2. Inherit Your Competitors’ Broken Backlinks\n\nIt’s possible to inherit competitors’ broken backlinks. By suggesting your link as a replacement.\n\nThis works because web admins don’t like linking to broken pages. And you’re offering an easy solution.\n\nTo get started, go to Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool. And analyze a competitor’s domain. (In this case, a competitor is any site that publishes content similar to yours.)\n\nThen, go to the “Indexed Pages” report. And check the box next to “Broken Pages.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of pages on your competitor’s site that don’t work properly. Sorted according to the number of domains that link to them.\n\nStarting at the top, identify a page that you have a good replacement for. (Or could create a good replacement for.)\n\nThen, click the corresponding link to see a list of the page’s backlinks.\n\nFilter for “Active” and “Follow” links. \n\nThen, judge which backlink opportunities are worth pursuing. Using the tips outlined in the previous section.\n\nNote\n\nFollow links are links that do not contain a nofollow, sponsored, or ugc attribute. These attributes suggest that search engine bots ignore the link for SEO purposes.\n\nWhen you email your contact, it’s crucial to explain why your link makes a good replacement. \n\nHere’s a template you can use:\n\nSubject: Broken link on your page\n\nHi [Name],\n\nI noticed your article [Linked Article Title] contains a broken link on the text “[anchor text].”\n\nIf you’re looking for an alternative, we’ve just published [Linked Article Title]. It’s a good fit because [explanation].\n\nBest,\n\n[Your Email Signature]\n\nThe power of reciprocity (“you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours”) means there’s a pretty good chance of the recipient accepting your pitch.\n\nAll that’s left is to follow up, keep records, and repeat the process.\n\n3. Respond to Relevant Media Requests\n\nMedia requests are formal appeals for quotes, statistics, or other contributions for a piece of content. Typically issued by journalists.\n\nIf you provide what the journalist needs, you may get featured in their article. And receive a backlink to your website as attribution.\n\nFor example, here are some requests posted on the Featured platform: \n\nThere are many other services that allow users to submit and respond to media requests. Such as Connectively, Qwoted, and ProfNet.\n\nThe right one for you depends on your niche, location, etc.\n\nGenerally, these are the steps you need to follow:\n\nSign up as a source/expert and create a personal profile highlighting your areas of expertise\nOpt in to email alerts about relevant requests and monitor your inbox\nRespond to relevant requests as quickly and strategically as possible\nFollow up if necessary and track the results of your efforts\n\nTo maximize the chance of being featured, make sure your responses are relevant, concise, and unique. \n\nTo maximize the chance of getting a backlink, ask the journalist to credit you with one. And supply the link you want them to use. \n\nThe more relevant the link is to your submission, the better.\n\nNote\n\nGetting backlinks this way is sometimes called HARO link building. HARO stands for “Help a Reporter Out” and is the old name for Connectively.\n\n4. Get Featured on Resource Pages\n\nA resource page is a curated list of links that directs users to helpful content on a specific topic. \n\nFor example, a university website might have a resource page listing links to academic journals, research databases, and educational tools. \n\nIf you have a relevant, unique, and high-quality resource to add, the creator might be willing to give you a backlink, too.\n\nTo find resource pages in your niche, try these Google searches:\n\n[keyword] inurl:resources\n[keyword] inurl:links\n[keyword] intitle:resources\n[keyword] intitle:links\n\nFor example:\n\nNote\n\nGoogle search operators like “inurl:” and “intitle:” help you make more specific searches.\n\nThen, click through to see if your link would make a good addition to the page.\n\nIf so, send a short, friendly email to the page owner. Making sure to use a clear subject line. And explain how your link will add value to their resource list.\n\n5. Create Content People Naturally Want to Link To\n\nCreating link-worthy content (known as link bait) allows you to obtain backlinks naturally. \n\nGenerally, creators link to pages that add value to their own content. Especially if that page has content that would be difficult to replicate.\n\nSome of the most linkable formats include:\n\nExpert guides that act as reliable information sources\nInfographics that display data in a compact, visual format\nData studies that provide interesting statistics for writers to cite\nFree tools that creators can refer their audience to\nInteractive content that provides a unique and engaging experience\nTemplates that help target users achieve their goals\nLiving resources that creators can rely on to provide up-to-date information\n\nFor example, Techradar has a guide to the best VPNs: \n\nThe page is updated regularly and contains in-depth, reliable information.\n\nIt’s a great source for creators who want to provide their readers with advice about the best VPNs. But are unable to do so themselves.\n\nBacklink Analytics shows that the page has backlinks from over 2,000 domains:\n\nStart Building Links\n\nwith Your Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →\n6. Improve on Popular Content (Then Promote It)\n\nFind competitor content that has lots of links, improve upon it, then promote your version.\n\nThis is known as the skyscraper technique. And it works because you’re creating content that has proven demand—and giving creators good reason to link to your version. \n\nHere’s exactly how to create backlinks this way:\n\nGo to Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool and analyze a domain that produces content in your niche. This could be a commercial competitor, an industry blog, etc.\n\nGo to the “Indexed Pages” report to see which pages on the site have backlinks from the most domains.\n\n(Generally, the number of referring domains is more important than the number of backlinks. Because additional links from the same site carry less value.)\n\nReview the source pages to find content that:\n\nYou could improve upon: There needs to be room for you to add value. For example, could you make the content more comprehensive, visually appealing, or interactive?\nFits your brand: You shouldn’t create content purely for link-building purposes. It’s important that the content makes sense for your brand. And supports other marketing goals.\n\nThen, look at the content’s backlink data to see if it gets the kinds of backlinks you want to acquire or replicate.\n\nIf so, you’ve found a good candidate for the skyscraper technique.\n\nAfter publishing your skyscraper content, consider reaching out to the sites that link to your competitor’s resource. To explain why they should link to your version instead.\n\nSend outreach emails to other sites that might be interested, too. Using Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nIt identifies link building prospects based on your target keywords and competitors. \n\nAnd helps you send and track your outreach emails.\n\n7. Turn Unlinked Brand Mentions into Backlinks\n\nUnlinked brand mentions occur when someone references your brand in their content but doesn’t include a link to your website.\n\nYou can turn mentions into backlinks with the help of the Brand Monitoring app.\n\nAfter signing up, create a query for your brand name. And make sure to include your domain in the “Track backlinks” section.\n\nNext, go to the “Mentions” report and apply the following filters:\n\n“Sentiment” > “Neutral,” “Positive,” and “Unknown” (It may be unwise to contact sites that have talked about your brand negatively.)\n“Mention details” > “Backlinks” > “Without backlinks”\n\nNow you have a list of unlinked brand mentions.\n\nFind instances where it would make sense for the creator to add a link. And where the backlink would most likely benefit your business.\n\nThen, it’s just a matter of sending the right email to the right person.\n\nMake sure to:\n\nThank the creator for mentioning your brand\nDescribe exactly where the link should go and where it should point to\nExplain why your link will add value for their readers\n\nThis can help you gain backlinks that are highly relevant and natural.\n\n8. Replicate Your Competitors’ Backlinks\n\nCompetitors may have backlinks you can replicate.\n\nFor example, your rival might have a quality backlink because their CEO gave an interview to an industry publication. And you might be able to arrange an interview with the same site.\n\nOr perhaps your rival is listed in an industry round-up that could include your brand, too.\n\nBuilding backlinks in this way allows you to close competitive gaps. Plus, it has a pretty high success rate. Because you’re using proven techniques.\n\nTo get started, go to the Backlink Gap tool.\n\nEnter your own domain and up to four competitors’ domains. Then, click “Find prospects.”\n\nThe tool will present sites that link to at least one competitor but not to you.\n\nAlong with the following data:\n\nAS: The Authority Score (AS) of the referring domain. Generally, backlinks from higher-AS sites are more valuable for SEO.\nMonthly Visits: The estimated number of monthly visits to the referring domain. The higher the number, the larger your prospective backlink’s potential reach.\nMatches: The number of analyzed competitors that have backlinks on this domain. The more competitors a site links to, the more likely it is to link to you, too.\n\nYou can see details about your competitors’ backlinks by clicking the arrows in the corresponding columns.\n\nClick through to the source pages to find backlinks that you may be able to—and want to—replicate.\n\nThen, it’s a case of contacting the site with your pitch.\n\nAs always, you need to personalize your email, make a clear proposal, and explain what’s in it for the recipient.\n\n9. Leverage Your Existing Partnerships\n\nIf you already have professional relationships with organizations or influencers in your niche, use them to get backlinks. \n\nHere’s how to get backlinks for your website this way:\n\nProvide testimonials for your suppliers\nAsk member associations to include your business in their listings\nGet your linked logo featured on partner websites (e.g., in an “Our clients” section)\nCreate co-marketing campaigns around newsworthy events (e.g., product collaborations)\n\nIf you’re not sure where to start, create a list of your business partners, suppliers, etc. Then, look at their website for linking opportunities. \n\nThe best way to approach your backlink request depends on your relationship with the organization.\n\nJust make sure that you don’t suggest a “you link to me and I’ll link to you” agreement. This form of reciprocal linking is against Google’s spam guidelines.\n\n10. Try to Recover Your Lost Backlinks\n\nIt’s possible to lose backlinks when websites update, move, or delete their content.\n\nBut it’s also possible to get them back.\n\nAfter setting up your project on the Backlink Audit tool, go to the “Lost & Found” report.\n\nThen, scroll down to the table and apply the “Lost” filter.\n\nYou’ll see domains you lost backlinks from during the date range at the top.\n\nTip\n\nIf this is the first time you’re trying to get backlinks this way, you might want to extend the date range. But in the future, it’s best to recover lost backlinks as quickly as possible. \n\nNow, decide which backlinks you want to recover (if any.)\n\nTake into account:\n\nThe domain’s toxicity score (TS): Take extra care before contacting sites in the 45-59 range and avoid sites in the 60-100 range. Toxic backlinks can do more harm than good for your site.\nThe potential value of the backlink: If you lose a backlink from a low-authority, low-quality, or low-relevancy page, it might not be worth recovering.\nThe likelihood of recovery: This depends largely on the reason for the link loss and your relationship with the website.\n\nIf you proceed with outreach, explain where and why the link should be reinstated. \n\nStreamline the Backlink Building Process\n\nNo matter how you get backlinks for your website, Semrush’s Link Building Tool can help you streamline the process.\n\nIt allows you to:\n\nFind email addresses for suggested or imported prospects\nCreate and use email templates for different backlink building methods\nTrack whether your outreach emails have been delivered, opened, or replied to\nMonitor the status of the backlinks you generate\n\nCreate your free Semrush account to try this tool and many others.\n\nStart Building Links\n\nwith Your Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
