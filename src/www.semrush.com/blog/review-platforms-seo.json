  "content": "Customer reviews are like magnets. They can pull potential customers toward your business.\n\nCollecting reviews on customer review websites can build trust and encourage conversions. \n\nAnd, in the case of Google reviews, can improve your local search engine rankings, resulting in increased online visibility.\n\nLet’s look at the benefits of customer reviews and the 10 best customer review sites for businesses.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Customer Reviews?\n\nCustomer reviews can help businesses:\n\n1. Build Trust \n\nCustomers prefer to purchase from brands they trust. \n\nIn fact, 46% of U.S. consumers are willing to pay a premium for trusted brands, according to 2022 research from Salsify.\n\nImage Source: Salsify\n\nThis indicates how important it is for brands to position themselves as trustworthy.\n\nPositive customer reviews can help build that trust. \n\nWhen potential customers see positive reviews from other customers, it provides reassurance about the product’s quality and the company’s reliability.\n\n2. Improve Online Visibility\n\nCustomer reviews can directly influence your business’s online visibility. \n\nBy collecting them on customer review websites, you can increase the chances of your business profile being discovered by your target audience.\n\nCustomer reviews can also influence a business’s ranking in local search results.\n\nHow?\n\nBecause customer reviews directly impact a business’s rankings on online review sites like Google Business Profile (GBP), Yelp, and Tripadvisor. \n\nSearch engines often fetch information from these sites for local search results. \n\nAnd Google has clearly stated that it considers review count and review score on GBP when determining local search rankings: \n\nFor instance, a New York-based Indian restaurant with more reviews and a better overall rating on its Google Business Profile could rank higher than its competitors.\n\nHowever, customer reviews are just one part of the equation. Search engines consider many other factors when determining local rankings.\n\nCreating and managing your business’s profile across different customer review sites is a best practice—but it can be challenging. \n\nImagine the time and effort you’d have to spend monitoring your presence across these platforms. \n\nOr you can use Semrush’s Listing Management tool. \n\nIt streamlines the entire process by centralizing the management of your business listings on multiple customer review websites. \n\nSo whether you want to create profiles or manage customer reviews across different review sites, the Listing Management tool can help simplify these tasks and enhance your online presence.\n\nIncrease Your Visibility\n\nwith the Listing Management Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Drive More Sales\n\nPositive reviews can also increase customer spending.\n\nAs more potential customers discover your business online and find it trustworthy, they’re more likely to purchase from you. Driving more sales and revenue.\n\nSo, it’s fair to say that customer reviews play a pivotal role in helping businesses grow.\n\nCompanies should make a habit of collecting them on customer review sites. But which sites should you specifically focus on?\n\nHere are the 10 best rating sites where you can collect these reviews.\n\nThe 10 Best Customer Review Sites for Your Business\n1. Google Business Profile\n\nGoogle Business Profile (GBP) is a free tool that lets businesses manage their online presence and improve visibility across different Google services like Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Shopping. \n\nFor example, if you search “best Indian restaurants in Manhattan” on Google, you’ll get a result like this:\n\nThis is called a Google Local Pack (or Map Pack.)\n\nIt’s a search engine results page (SERP) feature that displays top local businesses for location-specific queries in search results. \n\nGoogle builds Local Pack results from Google Business Profile listings. So, it’s a good practice to encourage your customers to leave reviews on your GBP.\n\nBecause Google is the starting point for many people looking to find or evaluate local businesses, it’s a perfect opportunity for these companies to attract more customers.\n\nBy managing your Google Business Profile, you can help your business appear when someone searches your company’s name. Or performs a local search related to the products or services you offer. \n\nSome of your competitors’ Google Business Profiles may already be ranking for location-specific queries you want to target.\n\nTo compete with them, optimize your listing with relevant information like business phone number, address, photos, operating hours, videos, and more.\n\nCreating and optimizing your Google Business Profile can help your business appear in Google Maps.\n\nBy adding your products to your Google Business Profile listing, you can also make them appear in Google Shopping for location-specific keywords.\n\n2. Facebook\n\nFacebook is the most popular social media platform, with billions of active users. \n\nBesides scrolling their feeds and communicating with loved ones, people also use Facebook to discover businesses. \n\nCreating and optimizing your Facebook business page presents a huge opportunity for local businesses. Especially if your target audience uses Bing.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Bing uses Facebook reviews for its local search results.\n\nTo optimize your Facebook business page, include your business address, phone number, email, operation hours, and other relevant information. You can also engage your audience through posts, stories, giveaways, and more. \n\nUsers can rate your business and leave written feedback on your Facebook business page. Unlike many other review platforms, Facebook asks users whether they recommend or don’t recommend a company. \n\nBased on this input, Facebook calculates the business’s recommendation rating. It ranges from 1-5 and appears on the left side of the business’s profile.\n\nBy clicking on it or the “Reviews” tab, users can read all the reviews that others have left. \n\nThese reviews are public, and business owners have the opportunity to respond. \n\nFacebook also allows customers to interact directly with a business via messaging. Providing a convenient and personal way for them to connect with your company. \n\n3. Yelp\n\nYelp is a popular review site among local customers. Millions of people use it to discover and evaluate local businesses. \n\nThese range from restaurants and retail stores to service-based businesses like contractors and electricians. \n\nYelp offers a wide range of filters to help users find exactly what they want. Users can sort businesses based on the following factors: “Recommended,” “Highest Rated,” and “Most Reviewed.”\n\nThis highlights the importance of both the quantity and quality of Yelp’s customer reviews. \n\nAnd Yelp’s functionality goes beyond just being a directory. The platform fosters a two-way communication channel, allowing users to message businesses directly. \n\nBusiness owners can claim their Yelp listings for free. \n\nCreating and optimizing your Yelp listing can put your business in front of more potential customers. This includes adding relevant information like phone number, hours of operation, photos, videos, address, specialties, and more. \n\nAlso, search engines like Yahoo use Yelp for local search results. \n\nWhich makes it even more important to encourage your customers to leave reviews on your Yelp listing.\n\n4. Tripadvisor\n\nTripadvisor is an online platform that provides travelers with the relevant information they need to plan their trips. \n\nOne of Tripadvisor’s core functionalities is helping consumers discover and evaluate local businesses. Including hotels, holiday homes, and restaurants. \n\nTripadvisor operates across several countries in several languages. The platform features over a billion reviews about millions of companies worldwide. \n\nSearch engines like DuckDuckGo and Bing feature Tripadvisor reviews for local search results. Like this result from DuckDuckGo:\n\nSo by collecting customer reviews on Tripadvisor, you can increase the chances of your business appearing on DuckDuckGo and Bing for local search results. \n\nTripadvisor offers several filters and sorting options to help users find exactly what they’re looking for. For example, you can select your preferred property types or amenities to narrow down your search. Or you can sort the results based on factors like pricing, distance or distance to city center.\n\nThey also use a popularity ranking algorithm based on the quality, quantity, and recency of reviews. \n\nBusinesses can create or claim their Tripadvisor listing for free. \n\nAfter doing so, optimize it with relevant information like business address, phone number, operating hours, photos, and more. You can also run ads to promote your business on the platform.\n\nTravelers and locals can write reviews and rate businesses. Businesses can directly respond to reviews on their Tripadvisor profile. \n\nCompanies can also incorporate Tripadvisor’s widget on their website that fetches dynamic content from their Tripadvisor listing to their website.\n\n5. G2\n\nG2, formerly called G2 Crowd, is an online review platform for software businesses. Over 80 million B2B buyers use the platform to discover and evaluate software. \n\nThe platform provides users with relevant information about software like product information, customer reviews, pricing, and features. \n\nUsers can rate products on a scale of 1-5. Customer reviews on G2 are in-depth, as users are asked to provide specific information while reviewing software. \n\nSome common questions asked during the review process are:\n\nWhat do you like best about [software]?\nWhat do you dislike about [software]?\nWhat problems is [software] solving, and how is that benefiting you?\n\nYou can directly respond to these reviews on your G2 profile. \n\nHere’s an example of a G2 review: \n\nCreating or claiming your G2 profile can help you improve your online visibility and understand your customers’ pain points and areas for improvement. \n\nYou can do it all for free. The free plan includes basic G2 Profile abilities, access to earned badges, and beginner review collection capabilities.\n\nTo unlock additional features like advanced customization options, review promotion, access to demand capture tools, analytics, and others, you’ll need to subscribe to one of their paid plans. \n\n6. Amazon\n\nAmazon is one of the world’s largest retailers, with millions of monthly active users. \n\nMore people start their product searches on Amazon than on Google. \n\nSo, customers rely on Amazon reviews for making purchasing decisions. \n\nEven if they aren’t looking to purchase from Amazon, customers read product reviews on the platform as a reference for gauging product quality and reliability.\n\nCustomer reviews play a significant role in determining the rankings of Amazon product listings. The more positive reviews your Amazon product listing has, the higher it will rank in Amazon search results. \n\nMoreover, search engines display Amazon listings for many product searches. \n\nSo, having more positive customer reviews on an Amazon listing can increase its chances of appearing on search engines for relevant product-specific queries. \n\nCustomers can rate products on Amazon on a scale of 1-5, regardless of whether they have made a purchase or not. \n\nAmazon differentiates these reviews by marking those from customers who have actually purchased the product through Amazon as “Verified Purchase.”\n\nAmazon doesn’t directly allow sellers to respond to these reviews (whether positive or negative). \n\nBoth third-party Amazon sellers and manufacturing brands benefit from positive Amazon reviews. \n\nSince many consumers rely on Amazon reviews for purchasing decisions, manufacturing brands should consider selling on Amazon. Not just to drive more sales—but also increase awareness.\n\n7. Trustpilot\n\nTrustpilot is a popular third-party review site that lets customers review businesses they have purchased from. \n\nCustomers can rate these companies and leave detailed feedback on a scale of 1-5. However, the overall score is based on multiple factors like age and number of reviews, among others. \n\nThe platform is free for everyone. \n\nTo unlock more features, businesses can opt for one of Tripadvisor’s paid plans. Some additional features include: \n\nInviting more customers to leave reviews\nDisplaying feedback on individual product lines\nManaging reviews for multiple locations\nGaining deeper insights through advanced analytics\n\nTrustpilot offers a wide range of features to help companies get, manage, showcase, and analyze customer reviews. \n\nFor instance, you can easily embed a Trustpilot widget to display your Trustpilot reviews on your website. \n\nAdditionally, Trustpilot integrates with Zendesk, Freshdesk, Slack, and many other platforms to better manage, analyze, and respond to these reviews.\n\n8. Angi\n\nAngi (formerly Angie’s List) is a U.S.-based review platform designed to help homeowners find, rate, and review home service professionals. Like plumbers, roofers, electrical workers, landscapers, and more.\n\nUsers get personalized quotes based on their specific requirements. They can also request quotes from specific service professionals.\n\nHome service professionals can list their businesses to build a strong online presence on Angi. \n\nThey can use Angi to showcase their work, customer reviews, and other relevant business information. And use the platform to manage quote requests and communicate with potential customers. \n\nCustomer reviews play a pivotal role in whether a service professional gets hired on Angi. \n\nAngi verifies each review for its authenticity. Making the platform a reliable source for customers looking to hire service professionals.\n\n9. Better Business Bureau (BBB)\n\nBetter Business Bureau (BBB) is a name people trust when they want to learn about a business. \n\nWhile customers can write reviews on BBB, that's not how businesses get their grades. \n\nBBB gives businesses a grade from A+ to F. Instead of being based solely on what customers say, BBB considers factors like:\n\nBusiness’s complaint history with BBB\nTime in business\nType of business\nFailure to honor commitments to BBB\nTransparent business practices\nAdvertising issues known to BBB\nLicensing and government actions known to BBB\n\nMillions of consumers in the United States, Canada, and Mexico trust BBB. So your BBB grade can affect your business. \n\nA positive BBB rating can boost people’s trust in your business. While a negative one might make potential customers hesitate before making a purchase or using your services.\n\n10. Foursquare\n\nFoursquare is the underlying location engine for brands like Spotify, Snapchat, and Coca-Cola—among others. \n\nBut it’s also a review platform that lets people discover and learn about local companies. \n\nTo find the best fit based on location, customers can evaluate businesses using the map on the right-hand side. \n\nFoursquare also offers several filters to help users find exactly what they’re looking for. For instance, you can refine your search based on what’s recommended by those you follow.\n\nBy claiming or creating their listings, businesses can put themselves in front of millions of people using Foursquare to find local companies. \n\nThey can also use it as a portfolio, where consumers can see what they offer and learn more about the business. \n\nWhile establishing your presence on these sites, it’s important to make it a habit to respond to all customer reviews, especially the negative ones.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nHow to Respond to Customer Reviews \n\nResponding to reviews shows that you value your customers’ opinions. \n\nResponding to Positive Customer Reviews\n\nHere are a few tips for responding to positive customer reviews:\n\nThank them for their time: Acknowledge the customer’s effort by expressing gratitude in your response.\nMessage template: “Dear [customer name], thank you for choosing [your business] and taking the time to write this review. It means a lot to us!”\nPersonalize your response: Along with expressing gratitude, it’s equally important to personalize your response. This can make them feel special and valued, showing that you genuinely care about every single customer’s experience. Personalization isn’t just about using their name in your response. You should also mention specific details from the review that show your attentiveness and commitment to their satisfaction.\nMessage template: “Hi [customer name], we’re so glad to hear that you enjoyed the [specific product/service]. We remember how you mentioned the importance of [specific detail they highlighted], and we're thrilled that it met your expectations!

Please come back soon; we have even more to offer!”\nResponding to Negative Customer Reviews\n\nResponding to negative reviews is hard but necessary. It’s tough to take harsh criticism and deal with angry customers. \n\nBut no matter how aggressive customer reviews are, you need to acknowledge and respond to them. This will help you maintain your online reputation and show you value your customers’ opinions.\n\nHere are a few tips to handling negative reviews:\n\nAcknowledge the problem: Read reviews carefully and try to understand what your customer is unhappy about.

We're dedicated to resolving this issue and appreciate your patience.”\nOffer to resolve the situation: Address the situation or misunderstanding. Highlight your commitment to their satisfaction and willingness to take the necessary steps to make things right. \nMessage template: “Hi [customer name], we’re truly sorry for the trouble you’ve encountered. We’d like to make things right. One of our customer support representatives will reach out to you soon.”\nTake the extra step: Go beyond merely addressing and resolving the issue. Offer a heartfelt incentive like flowers, a box of chocolates, or store credit to encourage them to give your business a second chance. \nMessage template: “Dear [customer name], we deeply regret the experience you had. We’d love the chance to turn this around. We’d like to give you a [gesture] as a token of our commitment to your satisfaction.”\nUse it as an opportunity to improve your product/service: Learn from negative reviews to fix what’s wrong. Take the feedback seriously and make the necessary changes.\nMessage template: “Thank you for sharing your concerns, [customer name]. Your feedback helps us enhance our offerings. We’re taking your comments to heart and making necessary improvements.”\n\nNo matter how many review sites you’re on, make it a habit to respond—especially to the negative ones. \n\nKeeping track of and responding to reviews across different customer review websites can get overwhelming. \n\nMake it easier with Semrush’s Review Management tool.\n\nIt lets you monitor and reply to reviews across different customer review sites.
