  "content": "What Is PPC Tracking?\n\nPay-per-click (PPC) tracking helps you understand and measure the performance of your PPC marketing campaigns.\n\nYou can run PPC ads across various platforms. Like Google Ads, Bing Ads, and social media. This can help you: \n\nRaise brand awareness\nAcquire new customers\nDrive sales\nAnd more\n\nThere are many different ad formats and payment models. But the general idea is: When someone clicks on your ad, you pay for that click. \n\nLet’s say you’re running a pay-per-click campaign on Google Ads. Like this one from a pet food brand.\n\nWhen you set up your ads, you had to choose: \n\nSearch terms (keywords) that you want your ad to display for\nYour desired cost per click (CPC) for each search term (also known as a keyword bid)\nThe total available budget for your ad\n\nWhen you track your PPC ad, you’ll probably want to understand things like:\n\nHow many people saw your ads and made a purchase?\nWhich ads and keywords drive the most purchases?\nHow is your return on investment (ROI)?\n\nThis is where pay-per-click tracking comes in. It helps you understand how your audience interacts with your ads. From seeing the ad, to clicking the ad, to taking some kind of meaningful action (known as a conversion). The conversion is likely a purchase or something that similarly benefits your brand.\n\nBy keeping an eye on key metrics like clicks and conversions, you see what’s working and what’s not. \n\nBenefits of PPC Tracking\n\nPPC tracking helps you understand ad performance. Both your competitors’ and your own. \n\nThe resulting insights have many advantages, such as: \n\nAd optimization: Fine-tune your campaigns by adjusting keywords, ad copy, targeting, and bidding strategies to drive better results\nEfficient budget allocation: Figure out which ads are performing (and which are not) so you can allocate your budget effectively and drive more ROI \nCompetitive advantage: Use insight into the keywords, messaging, and channels your competitors are using to guide your own strategy\n\nTracking is an essential component of your overall PPC strategy. But for your tracking to be effective, you need to know which metrics to watch. \n\nKey PPC Tracking Metrics \n\nHere are the main PPC tracking metrics you should keep an eye on. And what each one reveals about your campaign performance:\n\nAverage position: Where, on average, your ad appeared on the search results page. A higher position often leads to more visibility and clicks.\nImpressions: How many times your ad was displayed. Use this metric to gauge the visibility of your ads and the size of your reach.\nClicks:How many times your ad has been clicked. A good indication of how much traction you’re currently getting on your ad.\nClick-through rate (CTR): The ratio of impressions to clicks. It shows you how effective your ad is at encouraging viewers to take action. And likely reflects the quality of your copy, offer, or graphic display.\nConversion rate: The percentage of clicks that led to a desired action, such as a purchase or signup. This is key for understanding the effectiveness of your ads in driving business outcomes.\nWebsite visits: How many visitors came to your website from your ads. It's crucial for understanding the volume of traffic PPC contributes to your site.\nApp interactions: The number of engagements within your app that resulted from ad clicks. This is important for campaigns aimed at promoting app usage.\nPhone calls: If your ads include a call option, PPC call tracking measures how many calls were made directly from your ads. It's essential for businesses that rely on phone calls to connect with customers.\nImport from other sources: This involves tracking conversions that started with a click on your ad but were completed elsewhere, like in an app or offline. It provides a more complete picture of how your ads contribute to conversions.\nQuality score: Google's rating of the quality and relevance of your keywords and PPC ads. It reflects the health of your PPC campaign and impacts cost and effectiveness. A higher quality score can lead to lower costs and better ad positioning. \n\nMonitoring these metrics enables you to understand how your PPC campaigns are performing. Evaluate the results and make changes if needed. \n\nHow to Track PPC Metrics\nPosition Tracking\n\nSemrush’s Position Tracking tool is a PPC tracking solution that helps you monitor the visibility of your campaigns. It provides valuable information, such as:\n\nYour average position\nTop keywords\nRanking distribution\n\nTo get started, open the tool. And select “+ Project.” Then enter your domain and give the project a name. Click “Create project” when you’re done.\n\nIn the “Targeting” window, select your search engine (like Google or Bing), device, location, and name. Then click “Continue To Keywords.”\n\nTip\n\nCheck out our in-depth guide if you need more information on Position Tracking configuration.\n\nNow, add keywords. Do this manually. Or, click “Import from…” and you’ll see more options.\n\nThe most accurate way to track your PPC keywords in Semrush is to export the keywords from your Google Ads or Microsoft advertising account to a CSV file. \n\nTo do this in Google Ads, navigate to “Audiences, keyword and content” and then click “Search keywords.” Then hit the “Download” button and choose “.csv” format.\n\nAlternatively, click the “Google Analytics” option to import the keyword data from there. Or select “Semrush suggestions” to have the keyword data filled in automatically. Just choose the number of keywords to add and hit “Import.”\n\nDecide if you want to receive weekly ranking updates or not. And when you’re done, click “Start Tracking.”\n\nYou’ll see some key information related to your brand’s keyword performance. To see PPC data only, click the button in the top-right corner and select “Google Ads” or “Bing Ads.”\n\nNote\n\nYou’ll only see the option to track Bing Ads if you chose Bing as your search engine while setting up the Position Tracking tool. Google Ads is displayed if you chose Google.\n\nTo see your average position, navigate to the “Overview” tab, choose your desired timeframe, and click “Avg. Position.”\n\nTo see your average position for specific keywords, scroll down to the “Rankings Overview” section.\n\nSet up custom alerts to be notified of significant changes.\n\nTo set up an alert, click the bell icon in the upper-right corner of the page. Then, select your alert triggers. Like when a keyword enters the top 10, or gains or loses by more than 10 places. When you’re done, hit “Add my first trigger.”\n\nAdvertising Research\n\nSemrush’s Advertising Research is a PPC tracker that provides insight into the performance and strategy of any brand. Like your competitors. \n\nTo get started, enter the company’s domain and choose the location. Then hit “Search.”\n\nThe default “Positions” tab shows you how many paid keywords bring users to the site, estimated monthly traffic, and the estimated monthly costs. \n\nScroll down to the “Paid Search Trends” section to see how traffic, keywords, and costs have trended over time. You can choose a time period of one month, six months, one year, two years, or all time in the upper right. \n\nScroll down to view the “Paid Search Positions” section. This is a list of keywords the brand is bidding on. \n\nFor example, notice that Starbucks is targeting terms like “coffee shop” and “starbucks gift card”:\n\nTo remove branded keywords (that include the company’s name), scroll back up and click “Advanced filters.” Then select “Exclude,” “Keyword type,” and “Branded.” Then hit “Apply.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of the unbranded keywords a competitor is bidding on. Like “coffee shop near me”:\n\nFor each keyword, you can see the position, the estimated tracking, and the estimated costs. \n\nGo one step further and take a look at their actual ads. Just open the “Ads Copies” tab.\n\nThese insights can help you understand which keywords a competitor is going after. And what ads the brand is running.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nGoogle Ads Conversion Tracking\n\nThe Google Ads platform is one of the main PPC tools. It gives you many insights into how your campaigns across Google’s properties are performing. \n\nThis includes ads on:\n\nGoogle Search\nGoogle Shopping\nYouTube\nThe Google Display Network (GDN) \n\nOne of the most important things to keep an eye on is the number of conversions. And conversion-related metrics like conversion rate and CPC.\n\nTo see conversion data, open Google Ads and go to the “Campaigns” tab under “Campaigns.” \n\nClick “Columns” and then “Conversions” to display conversion data. \n\nPro tip​​​​​​\n\nIn Google Ads, your account is split into campaigns, ads, and keywords. You can learn more about how this structure works in our guide, Google Ads Account: What Is It & How to Create One.\n\nTo see conversion data at the ad group level, just click the “Ad groups” tab under “Campaigns”:\n\nTo see how many conversions individual ads have generated, click the “Ads” tab under “Campaigns.”\n\nIn the “Search keywords” tab under “Audiences, keywords, and content”, see how individual keywords are performing. \n\nThe “Search terms” tab under “Insights and reports” shows you which searches triggered your ads. If you spot your ads showing for irrelevant terms, you can add those terms to your negative keyword list. To learn how to do that, check out our negative keywords guide.\n\nPro tip\n\nWondering what actions to take next based on the data you see in Google Ads? Our PPC Checklist can help you spot opportunities for improvement and ways to optimize your ads. \n\nGoogle Analytics PPC Tracking\n\nWith Google Analytics, you gain additional information about your PPC campaigns across Google, Microsoft, and social media. And you can compare PPC with other channels like email and organic (unpaid) search.\n\nTo see how different channels contribute to your traffic and conversions, open the “Traffic Acquisition” tab under “Acquisition.” You’ll see Google Ads (and Bing Ads, if you’re running them) under “Paid Search.”\n\nThis can help you figure out how your PPC campaigns and other marketing activities are performing. Compare the traffic and conversions each channel generates.\n\nWant to learn even more about the ways your PPC audience is engaging with your site? You’ll need to create a comparison. By default, Google shows you data for all channels together. Creating a comparison enables you to view data for PPC specifically.\n\nTo do that, click “Add comparison +” at the top of the page. A “Build comparison” window will pop up. \n\nUnder “Dimension” select “First user manual source / medium.” \n\nThen select the “Match Type,” “contains,” and in the “Value” field, type in “CPC”. \n\nAnd click “Apply.”\n\nOnce you’ve created your comparison, navigate to the “Engagement” tab on the left and click “Overview.” \n\nHere, you see more details about how users interact with your site. Like how much time they spend on your site. And how often they return. \n\nYou’ll see the average engagement time in minutes. This tells you how long a user stays on your site, on average. The blue line represents all traffic sources. And the orange line is your PPC traffic. \n\nScroll down to see more insights. Like the top pages users visit and user activity over time. \n\nIf you are running an ecommerce store, you can use Google Analytics to dig deeper into what people bought. Just select “Ecommerce purchases” from the menu on the left under “Monetization.”\n\nTo learn more about the user journey and how customers move through your marketing funnel, open the “Purchase journey” tab under “Monetization.” \n\nHere, you’ll see the percentage of customers that started a session, viewed a product, added a product to their cart, began checkout, and made a purchase. You also see what device they were using at the time.\n\nOpen the “Retention” tab to see the ratio of returning to new users, some user retention statistics, and lifetime value (LTV). For each new user, Google Analytics calculates the sum of purchase events during the user's first 120 days. LTV is the average of this metric for all users.\n\nIn the “Tech overview” tab under “Tech,” you see more information about the kind of browser and device your customers are using. Click “Tech details” under “Tech” for a more detailed overview of the key metrics. Like engagement rate and conversions. \n\nThis helps you understand how users on different devices and browsers perform. Use this information to tailor your future campaigns. \n\nFor instance, if mobile users convert higher, you could bid higher for mobile users. Or if users on a particular browser aren’t converting, you might want to check your site is functioning correctly. \n\nPro tip\n\nIf you need to conduct a thorough audit of your PPC campaigns, our free guide can help: How to Do a PPC Audit in 10 Steps.\n\nGoogle Tag Manager \n\nTo see site and conversion data in Google Ads and Google Analytics, you’ll need to set up conversion tracking. This involves installing a tracking pixel on your website. \n\nIt’s essentially a few lines of JavaScript code that enables Google Ads and Google Analytics to see what users do on your site. And populate that data in your reports.\n\nThe most efficient way to do this is with Google Tag Manager (GTM). \n\nTo implement the pixel, open Google Tag Manager and create an account (if you don’t already have one). \n\nThen open “Admin” and click “Install Google Tag Manager.”\n\nYou’ll see a few lines of code. It looks like this:\n\nYou’ll need to add this code to your site. This process will depend on your content management system (CMS). \n\nYou can do it manually by pasting the Google tag snippet into the custom HTML field of your CMS on every page of your site. Like this:\n\nOr install it without directly changing your code. For instance, if you manage your content with WordPress, you could use a plugin like Site Kit by Google.\n\nYou’d have to open \"Plugins'' and search for \"Site Kit by Google.\"\n\nThe plugin is free for the WordPress Creator plan. Click \"Install and activate.\"\n\nWhen the installation is complete, you'll be prompted to manage your new plugin.\n\nAnd then to set it up.\n\nYou can find the plugin in the new \"Site Kit\" menu. Choose to connect Google Analytics and click \"Sign in with Google.\"\n\nAllow Site Kit to view your Google Tag Manager and choose \"Continue.\"\n\nNow complete the setup.\n\nVisit the Site Kit menu dashboard to see key metrics.\n\nThis is just an example. If you are using a different CMS, this step will be different. But the rest of the process is the same. \n\nOnce you’ve added the pixel to your site, you’ll need to reopen Google Tag Manager and follow these steps: \n\nCreate a new tag for Google Ads. In your Google Tag Manager dashboard, click on \"Tags\" and then \"New\" to create a new tag. Choose \"Google Ads Conversion Tracking\" as the tag type.\nConfigure the tag. Enter the conversion ID and conversion label from your Google Ads account. These can be found in your Google Ads account under \"Tools & Settings\" and then \"Conversions.\"\nSet up triggering. Choose a trigger that defines when the tag should fire. For conversion tracking, this is typically set to \"Page View\" for thank you or confirmation pages that appear after a conversion action.\nSave and publish. Name your tag, save it, and then publish the changes in Google Tag Manager\n\nTo set up Google Analytics in Google Tag Manager, you’ll follow similar steps:\n\nCreate a new tag for Google Analytics: In Google Tag Manager, create a new tag and select \"Google Analytics: Universal Analytics\" as the tag type\nConfigure the tag:Select \"New Variable\" for the Google Analytics Settings and input your Google Analytics Tracking ID. Find it in your Google Analytics account under \"Admin\" and then \"Property Settings.\"\nChoose a trigger:To track page views, set the trigger to \"All Pages.\" You can also set up additional triggers for specific events or actions you want to track.\nSave and publish:Name your tag, save it, and then publish the changes in Google Tag Manager\n\nThat’s it! \n\nWith conversion tracking set up, you’ll see conversion data in Google Analytics and Google Ads. This can help you decide which campaigns to scale. And which to pause or optimize. Otherwise, you won’t know which campaigns are driving results. \n\nPro tip\n\nUse the \"Preview\" mode in GTM to make sure your tags are firing as expected before going live. Click the “Preview” button in the top right of your workspace, enter your site’s URL, then hit “Connect.”\n\nMicrosoft Advertising Conversion Tracking\n\nMicrosoft Advertising (formerly Bing Ads) offers a valuable opportunity to extend your reach beyond Google. If you advertise with Microsoft, you’ll want to track your ads. \n\nLike Google, Microsoft offers conversion tracking so you can measure how your ads drive sales.\n\nFollow these steps to configure conversion tracking with Microsoft Advertising:\n\n1. Set Up a Universal Event Tracking (UET) Tag:\n\nLog in to your Microsoft Ads account. If you don’t have one, you'll need to create one first.\n\nOpen the \"Tools\" section of the menu. And select \"Conversions\" from the “Advertising, targeting, and tracking” options.\n\nHit the \"+ Create\" button to get started.\n\nNow, give your UET tag a name. \n\nYou might also want to add a description to help remember its purpose or link it to your site's name. You can always change the tag’s name or description later if needed. \n\nPress \"Save and next\" when you’re done.\n\nAt this point, you’ll see a few different options: Add the code to your website, send the tag to a developer, or check Microsoft’s instructions for adding the tag to your content management platform. \n\nOr use Google Tag Manager. This is probably the fastest and easiest option if you are using Google Tag Manager already.\n\nTo add the tag to your site manually, select the option \"Install the tag yourself.\" And click “Next.”\n\nThen, copy and paste your code into the head or body sections of every webpage.\n\nAlternatively, set up “Microsoft Advertising Universal Event Tracking” via Google Tag Manager. \n\nTo do this, select “Automatically add the tracking tag through Google Tag Manager” and hit “Next.” You’ll be prompted to sign into Google. From there, follow the steps. \n\nAfter you’ve placed the UET tag on your site, Microsoft will start collecting data within about 24 hours.\n\n2. Define Your Conversion Goals\n\nOnce you’ve set up your UET tag, the next step is to define a conversion goal. This is usually a purchase. Or another meaningful action, like signing up for a newsletter. \n\nTo do this, click “Create a conversion goal” on your UET confirmation page:\n\nThis opens the “Conversion goals” screen. From here, click “+ Create.”\n\nYou’ll need to decide what kind of conversion you want to track. \n\nYou’ll probably want to select “Website.” Unless you’re measuring app downloads or offline conversions (like a phone call or store visit). \n\nWhen you’re done, hit “Next.”\n\nYou’ll be prompted to select a goal from the “Goal Category” drop-down menu. Like “Purchase” or “Submit lead form.” Pick one. \n\nThen move on to the “Goal type.” \n\nThe simplest option here is to choose “Destination URL.” And enter the URL of the page the user arrives at after they complete the desired action. Such as a thank you or confirmation page.\n\nWhen you’re done, click “Next.”\n\n If you want to, assigning a monetary value to the conversion is an option here. When you’re done, click “Next.” \n\nOn the next screen, choose whether to activate “Enhanced conversions” or not. This is supposed to make conversion tracking more accurate by matching users with other data, like email addresses. \n\nMake your decision by clicking the respective option. Then click “Save and next.”\n\nNext, select your UET tag from the drop-down list. Then click “Save and next.”\n\nConfirm you’ve already installed the UET tag by selecting the “Yes, the UET tag was already installed…” option from the menu.\n\nYou’ll find instructions for installing the event tag.\n\nOnce everything is set up correctly, you'll start seeing conversions in a few hours. \n\n3. Check Conversions in Microsoft Ads\n\nYou’ll find conversion data in various reports available in Microsoft Ads. A good place to start is the “Campaigns” report. \n\nCheck the “Conv.” column, which represents your tracked conversions.\n\nIf there’s data flowing in this report, your conversions are tracking properly.\n\nDive Deeper into PPC Tracking\n\nPPC tracking is essential for optimizing your pay-per-click campaigns. It shows you what's working and what isn't. So you can make tweaks when needed. And use your budget more effectively. \n\nSemrush's Position Tracking enables you to monitor your campaign performance and get insights beyond what you’ll find in Google Ads.
