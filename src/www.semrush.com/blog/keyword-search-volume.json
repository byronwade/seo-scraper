  "content": "What Is Keyword Search Volume?\n\nKeyword search volume is the average number of monthly searches for a particular search term in a particular location. And typically refers to searches in Google.\n\nFor example, Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool shows that “dog food” has a Google search volume of 135K in the U.S.:\n\nThis means there are an estimated 135,000 Google searches for “dog food” in the U.S. in a typical month.\n\nNote\n\nSemrush search volumes are based on Google searches from the previous 12 months. Our U.S. database has the most accurate search volumes on the market.\n\nFind Search Volumes\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nWhy Are Search Volumes Important?\n\nSearch volumes indicate the level of interest in a keyword. And how much traffic your search results could generate.\n\nThat means they can help you choose the best keywords for:\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO): Efforts to rank in organic (unpaid) search results\nPay-per-click (PPC) marketing: Efforts to rank in sponsored (paid) search results\n\nThat said, high-volume keywords aren’t always relevant to your business. And they tend to attract strong competition from other websites.\n\nSo, it’s important to consider search volumes alongside other keyword metrics. (More on this later.)\n\nHow to Find Keyword Search Volumes\n\nOne of the best ways to find Google search volumes is with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a term to base your search around, choose your target country, and click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will present a list of “Broad Match” keywords that contain your starting keyword or a close variation.\n\nAnd display their monthly search volumes in the “Volume” column.\n\nTo check if a keyword is relevant, click the icon in the “SF” column. \n\nThis lets you look at the Google results page in your chosen location (as of the date shown in the column to the right). So you can see what kinds of results perform well.\n\nTake a look at the other metrics provided in Keyword Magic Tool, too.\n\nIf you’re doing keyword research for SEO, enter your domain into the purple box. Then, look at the Personal Keyword Difficulty (PKD %) column.\n\nThis tells you how hard it’ll be for your specific domain to rank in Google’s top 10 organic results. \n\nAnd you may want to compare it to the general keyword difficulty (KD %) metric. Because when your Personal Keyword Difficulty score is the lower of the two numbers, it indicates the term is especially relevant to your website.\n\nIf you’re doing keyword research for PPC, pay attention to the “CPC (USD)” column. Which shows the average cost per click advertisers pay for each keyword.\n\nAnd the Competitive Density (Com.) column, which lets you know the level of competition between advertisers. On a scale from 0.00 (least competitive) to 1.00 (most competitive).\n\nTip\n\nYou can also find keyword search volumes and other metrics in these tools:\n \n\nKeyword Overview: Gather metrics for pre-selected keywords\nTopic Research: Get content ideas based on your chosen topic\nOrganic Research: Enter a URL to see what keywords it ranks for\nKeyword Gap: Compare your keyword rankings against competitors’\nHow to Find Local Keyword Search Volumes\n\nWith the Keyword Overview tool, you can find local search volumes—i.e., search volumes in particular regions or cities. \n\nThis helps you understand your potential reach in target areas. And better understand your localized audiences.\n\nTo get started, enter a keyword into the search bar.\n\nThen, choose your target country and sub-location. And click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will display the local and national search volumes:\n\nYou can also get other useful metrics for local keyword research.\n\nAnd analyze the results page for your chosen search location.\n\nTip\n\nClick keywords found in other Semrush tools (e.g., Keyword Magic Tool) to open them in Keyword Overview. Make sure to enter your target location once you get there.\n \n\nWhat Is a Good Search Volume for a Keyword?\n\nWhat makes a good search volume depends on the keyword’s competitiveness, cost, and potential business value. \n\nFor example, 100 monthly searches might be good for a low-competition, low-cost, and high-value keyword. Because the volume is likely to translate into worthwhile traffic and conversions.\n\nBut 100 monthly searches probably isn’t good for a high-competition, high-cost, and low-value keyword. Because the volume is unlikely to translate into worthwhile traffic and conversions.\n\nYou can evaluate these factors together in the Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nIf you’re researching keywords for SEO:\n\nLook at the search volume in the “Volume” column\nEvaluate competition levels with the Personal Keyword Difficulty score \nAnalyze the results page to determine the potential costs of creating top-ranking content\nAnalyze search intent (what the searcher wants to achieve) by looking at the “Intent” column and reviewing the search results page. To understand the keyword’s potential business value (i.e., how likely it is to drive conversions and how valuable these conversions could be).\n\nIf you’re researching keywords for PPC:\n\nLook at the search volume in the “Volume” column\nMeasure competition with the Competitive Density metric\nEvaluate potential costs with the average CPC metric\nAnalyze search intent (what the searcher wants to achieve) by looking at the “Intent” column and reviewing the search results page. To understand the keyword’s potential business value (i.e., how likely it is to drive conversions and how valuable these conversions could be).\nUnderstanding Search Volume Trends\n\nMany factors influence actual monthly search volumes, including:\n\nSeasonality: Some searches are tied to seasonal events (e.g., Christmas)\nTrends: Current events and trending topics can cause spikes in searches\nMarketing campaigns: Effective marketing can drive more online searches\nUser behavior: Shifts in user habits (e.g., the rise of mobile search)\nMarket factors: Competitor activities, economic indicators, etc.\n\nIn Semrush, the “Trend” graph shows how actual search volumes have fluctuated over the past 12 months. \n\nIf you need more context, search your keyword in Google Trends. \n\nYou can see how search interest has changed since 2004.\n\nLook out for the following kinds of keywords:\n\nEvergreen keywords: Terms that get consistent interest across the year. These tend to be good candidates for SEO and long-term ad campaigns.\nSeasonal keywords: Terms that get more interest at specific times of year. For the best results, you must plan your SEO and PPC efforts accordingly.\nFad keywords: Terms that experience a sudden and short-term spike in interest. These may be appropriate for advertising but aren’t good for SEO.\nDeclining keywords: Terms that are getting gradually less popular. These may prove less beneficial for your business than current search volumes suggest.\nRising keywords: Terms that are getting gradually more popular. These may prove more valuable for your business than current search volumes suggest. \nMonitor Your Keyword Rankings\n\nWhatever keywords you decide to target, track your rankings. To monitor your performance.\n\nSemrush's Position Tracking tool lets you monitor your organic and paid rankings for target keywords in target location(s). \n\nSo you can see what's working and what isn't. And act accordingly.\n\nResearch and Track Keywords\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
