  "content": "Are you unsure about potential SEO returns for your business? Or maybe you need help justifying your SEO budget to stakeholders.\n\nEither way, it’s important to understand SEO return on investment (ROI).\n\nBelow, we'll show you how to measure the ROI of SEO. Step by step. \n\nBut first, let's cover some basics.\n\nWhat Is the ROI of SEO?\n\nThe ROI of SEO measures how much revenue SEO activities generate for a business compared to their cost. It’s one of the most important concerns for any SEO consultant or manager. (Or anyone who does SEO, really.)\n\nIt’s an essential key performance indicator (KPI) to measure. It helps tie your SEO efforts to business goals. \n\nYou’ll have a positive SEO ROI if the revenue generated by your SEO strategy is higher than its cost.\n\nThe SEO ROI formula is simple. It’s similar to calculating ROI for any other type of investment. \n\nIt looks like this:\n\nFor example, if the revenue from SEO is $5,000. And the total SEO cost was $2,000, then the ROI is 150%.\n\nHowever, SEO ROI depends on multiple factors. Such as industry, competition level, website history, SEO strategy, and more. \n\nFor instance, industries with higher online competition might see a slower or lower ROI. Because they can need more effort and resources to rank well.\n\nBut the potential ROI and benefits of a well-executed SEO strategy make it a worthwhile investment for many businesses.\n\nFor example, using Semrush’s Organic Research tool, we see that the graphic design suite Canva gets around 19.8 million monthly organic visitors from the U.S. Which would cost $26.4 million in monthly ad spend—if it acquired this traffic from paid advertising. \n\nNote that it’s the monthly organic traffic from just the U.S. alone. The Domain Overview tool shows that Canva attracts over 168 million monthly organic traffic worldwide. \n\nThis organic traffic not only brings visitors but also represents a substantial monetary value. Which companies would otherwise need to invest in paid advertising to achieve. \n\nHowever, it can take time to see such significant SEO results.\n\nHowever, if you plan and execute an SEO strategy the right way, it can generate exponential (and recurring) ROI over the years. \n\nGet Insights into Competitors & Clients\n\nwith the Domain Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nWhy Is Measuring the ROI of SEO Important?\n\nOrganic search is a top traffic source for websites. Plus, almost every purchase today involves organic search in some way. \n\nWith SEO being such an important traffic channel, you should know its financial value for your business. \n\nLet’s look at some more reasons to measure the ROI of SEO:\n\nCommunicating success: While you should track other SEO KPIs, the ultimate measure of profitability is positive ROI. If you can prove a positive ROI, you’ll have a much easier time proving success and getting buy-in from stakeholders.\nAllocating resources: Tracking ROI helps you know which SEO tactics work (and which don’t). So you can allocate resources accordingly.\nBenchmarking: Measuring ROI coupled with competitor analysis reveals whether you’re outperforming or falling behind your competitors. So you can strategize your future SEO efforts. And stay ahead of the competition. \n\nThat said, let’s see how to determine SEO return on investment. \n\nHow to Measure SEO ROI\n\nWe already know the formula to measure the ROI of SEO:\n\nTo fill the data in this formula, we need two main components:\n\nSEO costs: The total investment in SEO activities\nRevenue from SEO: The total value of conversions (or sales) generated from SEO efforts\n\nLet’s go through the required steps.\n\n1. Calculate Your SEO Investment\n\nFirst, you need to calculate the cost of your total investment in SEO. \n\nAdd all the costs associated with the channel. Use this as your investment figure. \n\nTypically, these costs can include:\n\nIn-House SEO Resources\n\nThese are employees who work on SEO 100% of the time. \n\nSome roles—like copywriters or developers—may only occasionally work on SEO tasks. In this case, break down their cost to an hourly or daily rate. \n\nTrack their time spent on SEO tasks and add it to your calculation. \n\nFreelancers and Agencies\n\nIt’s simple to track SEO investment for outside SEO agencies and freelancers. Because most agency contracts are on a retainer model, usually with a fixed monthly fee.\n\nAdd agency fees (or freelancer rates) directly to your investment calculation. \n\nFurther reading: How to Outsource SEO: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nTools\n\nIf your team uses SEO tools (like Semrush), take the monthly cost and add it to your calculation. \n\nIf there are tools that other departments share, consider partially including the cost. Add these up. \n\nContent Distribution Costs\n\nSEO investment doesn’t just include content creation costs. \n\nYou also have to add content distribution and promotion costs. Such as social media promotion, influencer outreach, and email marketing. And the costs of tools you’d use for these activities. \n\nLink Building Costs\n\nLink building costs mainly consist of money spent on various activities for guest posting campaigns. Include all related expenses.\n\nThat’s your total cost of SEO investment. \n\nNote\n\nThese costs might change every month—which is normal. Just account for any changes when measuring your ROI of SEO. \n\n2. Track and Analyze Conversions\n\nNext, track and measure the value of each conversion. \n\nFor this step, you’ll need Google Analytics 4 (GA4) (or a similar tool). It can help you quickly and easily measure your business’s revenue from organic search. \n\nBut the type of conversions you track and the value you assign them are different for every business.\n\nFor example, ecommerce stores can use tracking to pull sales data from their online transactions. And accurately measure their revenue. However, lead generation businesses have to set up goals (like form submissions) and assign them dollar values. \n\nHere’s how to set up conversion tracking for ecommerce and lead-gen businesses.\n\nTracking Ecommerce Conversion Values\n\nTo start collecting ecommerce conversion data, add ecommerce events to your website in Google Tag Manager (GTM). \n\nIf you haven’t set it up yet, follow Google’s instructions. \n\nOnce you start tracking, you’ll see an ecommerce report with detailed information about your transactions. \n\nIn Google Analytics, go to “Reports” > “Monetization” > “Ecommerce purchases.”\n\nLike so:\n\nThen, filter to organic traffic. \n\nClick “Add filter.” Then select “Session source/medium” in the drop-down under “Dimension” and “google/organic” underneath “Dimension values.”\n\nThen, click “Apply.”\n\nThe detailed information is great. But we specifically want one number: the conversion value. \n\nSo, click the “Insights” icon on the top right. The tool will display the total revenue for the selected time frame. \n\nLike this:\n\nThis is your total value of conversions. \n\nTracking Lead Generation Conversion Values\n\nTracking conversions can be more challenging if you don’t make sales on your site.\n\nUnlike ecommerce transactions, a lead (or a conversion) doesn't have a specific associated value. Unless you assign one. \n\nDo this in Google Analytics. \n\nHead to “Admin” -> “Events.”\n\nAnd click “Create event.”\n\nThen, create events for each of your conversions. \n\nThese can be any actions that contribute to your business’s success. Like form submissions, free trial signups, or visits to a certain page. \n\nLet’s create an event for a form submission.\n\nFirst, give your event a name. Then select your “Parameter,” “Operator,” and “Value.” \n\nYou should see your conversion under “Existing events.” Next, toggle the switch under “Mark as conversion.” \n\nYou’ll now see your event as a conversion in the “Conversions” tab. \n\nYou still need to assign a monetary value to your conversion. \n\nTo do so, go to your event. In the “Parameter configuration” section, click “Add modification.”\n\nAnd in the “Parameter” field, enter a currency type (e.g., EUR) and enter the value (e.g., “50” for 50 euros).\n\nClick “Save,” and you’re done. \n\nUse this to help you calculate the ROI of your SEO. Every time an event is triggered, a monetary value is assigned to it.\n\nBut how do you know how much value to assign to each event?\n\nThe simplest (and usually most effective) way is by calculating:\n\nCustomer LTV is the total amount a customer is expected to spend with your business during the average lifetime of your relationship. \n\nAnd lead conversion rate is the percentage of leads you generate that turn into sales. \n\nFor example, let’s say the average lifetime value of a customer is $20,000 and your close rate is 15%. Your goal value should be set at $3,000. \n\nOf course, this method involves some assumptions and variables. However, it's a way to calculate the return for a business where leads are the main source of conversions. \n\nUnderstanding Assisted Conversions\n\nThere are often multiple touchpoints in the customer’s buying journey before they finally convert. \n\nSEO can play a role in initial brand awareness or later research stages. Even if it’s not the last touchpoint before the purchase.\n\nHowever, you don’t need to factor in the assisted conversions separately now. \n\nThe conversion reports in Google Analytics 4 already account for these partial contributions. From organic search to final conversions. \n\nBut it still makes sense to check how different channels contribute to conversions. \n\nClick “Advertising” > “Attribution” > “Attribution paths” in Google Analytics. \n\nChoose the conversion event you want to analyze. You’ll see how organic search contributes to different touchpoints in customers’ conversion journeys. \n\nBy this stage, you have the cost of investment in SEO and the value of your conversions. \n\nYou're ready to calculate your SEO campaign's ROI.\n\n3. Calculate Your Return on Investment\n\nOnce you have the numbers you need, calculating your ROI from SEO is easy.\n\nUse the same formula you saw before:\n\nSEO ROI = (SEO revenue - SEO costs) / SEO costs\n\nLet’s assume that in one month, your SEO campaign generated $200,000. And the cost of investment was $40,000. \n\nPlug these figures into your formula:\n\n($200,000 - $40,000) / $40,000 = 4\n\nThat means for every $1 you spent on SEO, you saw a return of $4. \n\nIn other words, your ROI is 400% (4 x 100 to get a percentage). \n\nThat's all there is to it. \n\nUse this formula to calculate the ROI of your SEO campaign across any period you choose. As long as you know the costs and returns. \n\nHow to Forecast SEO ROI\n\nNow that you know how to measure the ROI of SEO, start to think about forecasting. \n\nWhether you work in-house or at an agency, you’ll likely have to project how much growth and revenue you expect to generate.\n\nIn any case, forecasting SEO ROI is important. It helps allocate resources, prioritize SEO efforts, and make adjustments. \n\nTo start, consider the following:\n\nYour website’s past SEO performance\nYour traffic potential\nYour average conversion rate \n\nTo see a site’s SEO performance, plug its URL into Semrush’s Domain Overview tool and click “Search.” \n\nHead to the “Compare domains” tab and add your top four competitors. Then, click “Compare.”\n\nIf you scroll down, you’ll see a monthly traffic trend graph. Toggle between “Organic” and “Paid” to see if any competitors are driving traffic via pay-per-click (PPC) ads.\n\nScroll down further, and you’ll see two boxes. Check “Top Opportunities” to find keywords you should create content around. And “Keyword Overlap” to see the intersecting keywords among your competitors. \n\nThis shows the connection between organic traffic and content in your industry. \n\nCheck Website Performance at a Glance\n\nwith the Domain Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nAs for traffic potential, use our Traffic Analytics tool. Launch the tool and add your top four competitors. Then, click “Analyze.”\n\nYou’ll see the overall trend of visits, pages per visit, visit duration, bounce rate, and more. \n\nTake note of how overall traffic performance changes per quarter. \n\nYou can also go to the “Top Pages” tab to see which pages get the most traffic. Then, click on “Show Insights” to find pages with growing and declining traffic.\n\nObserve any seasonal changes. See how your site’s organic traffic performs compared to others. And look for trends that can help you forecast future strategies. \n\nFinally, consider your average conversion rate. You should have already calculated this if you’ve measured your SEO ROI. \n\nCreate hypotheses based on all the data you gathered. Think about which SEO activities can create which outcomes and result in how many conversions (and how much revenue). \n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Traffic\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nChallenges of Calculating and Communicating SEO ROI\n\nNow, let’s look at the nuances and challenges of calculating and communicating SEO ROI.\n\nThey are:\n\nIsolating SEO efforts: It can be difficult to attribute conversions solely to SEO. Because customers are influenced by multiple factors. Like search visibility, paid ads, branding efforts, and more. \nNon-financial benefits: SEO also generates value beyond conversions. For example, increased brand visibility, improved user experience, and more authority. It’s difficult to assign a dollar value to these long-term benefits.\nLong time frames for returns: It takes time to get significant results from organic search. So, it’s a big task to justify SEO investment to stakeholders. Who usually expect quick gains.\nOngoing returns from past efforts: Successful SEO campaigns continue to deliver value over time. So, it becomes difficult to calculate ROI for specific periods. \n\nTip\n\nFocus on the bigger picture when communicating SEO ROI. Highlight the long-term, cumulative benefits of SEO in addition to tangible metrics.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to See ROI from Your SEO Efforts?\n\nWhile you may see some quick wins early on, getting significant results from SEO takes time.\n\nTypically, it can take 4-12 months to see the benefits of SEO, according to Google’s Maile Ohye.\n\nIn most cases, SEOs need four months to a year to help your business first implement improvements and then see potential benefit.\n\n— Maile Ohye, Google\n\nSo, keep in mind that SEO is a long-term play. \n\nIf you consistently invest time, effort, and resources. The ROI compounds over time. \n\nWhile you do that, track your keyword rankings and site visibility with the Position Tracking tool.\n\nFollow the configuration instructions to set up keyword position tracking. \n\nOnce you’ve set up the tool, you’ll see a dashboard like this:\n\nLet’s say you want to analyze keywords in positions 4-10. To find optimization opportunities for ranking in the top three positions.\n\nGo to the “Overview” report. Click the “Top positions & changes” drop-down menu. Select “# 4-10” and “All.”\n\nScroll down to see your report for keyword rankings # 4-10. \n\nNow, check the keywords with low keyword difficulty (KD%) and high search volume. They’re low-hanging fruits. Identifying and capitalizing on these opportunities can boost your SEO and drive impactful results for your business. \n\nCreate an alert by clicking the bell icon at the top.\n\nFor example, get a notification when a keyword ranking drops from the top three positions. And take action to regain the position. \n\nTo learn more, read our detailed guide to keyword tracking.\n\nTrack Your Rankings and Visibility\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nMeasure Your SEO Progress with Semrush\n\nKnowing the ROI of your SEO is a powerful way to prove your efforts are working.
