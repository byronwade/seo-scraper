  "content": "​​​What Is Content Performance?\n\nContent performance refers to measuring the impact your published content makes on your target audience as well as your business. \n\nMarketers measure the performance of their content through different sets of metrics that we’ll go over shortly.\n\nAnd the purpose is to gain insights into how aligned your content is with your target audience, learn more about your customers, and understand whether your content is driving business results.\n\nWhy Is Content Performance Important?\n\nContent performance analysis is a key part of your content marketing efforts.\n\nImplementing a content strategy can take a lot of effort, time, and money. So, you want to make sure your content is generating your desired results.\n\nDiving deep into content marketing performance metrics lets you:\n\nFind ways to improve and optimize your content\nMake better decisions based on the data you collect\nAllocate your resources better \nAdvocate for leadership buy-in for further investments into content marketing\nKey Content Marketing Performance Metrics to Track\n\nLet’s explore 19 content performance metrics to measure for better results.\n\nUser Behavior Metrics\n\nUser behavior metrics help you understand visitors’ behavior on your website or app.\n\nViews\n\nViews represent the number of total visits your website or app got within a specific time frame. \n\nThey refer to visits from all sources. Like organic (unpaid) search, social media, email, referrals from other websites, and more.\n\nThis metric helps you understand which content formats and pieces are most popular among your audience. And they also allow you to identify the ones that are the least popular.\n\nThis information can inform your content strategy in the future. For example, you can choose to create more content about the topics that gain the most attention.\n\nTrack your website views in Google Analytics 4 (GA4). Here’s how:\n\nLog in to your GA4 account.\n\nClick “Reports” in the menu on the left.\n\nThen, click “Engagement” > “Pages and screens.”\n\nScroll down to see the table. The first column will show you how many views each page gets, sorted from highest to lowest.\n\nTo customize the time period, click on the date range in the top-right corner.\n\nChoose a predefined range from the left-hand menu. Or select a custom time frame in the calendar on the right.\n\nThen, click “Apply.”\n\nYou can now analyze this metric for the selected date range.\n\nUsers\n\nThe number of users refers to the number of unique visitors to your pages. It can help you understand the size of your audience and how frequently they visit your site.\n\nFor example, let’s say a certain page gets 100 views from a single user. Your audience isn’t 100 people—it’s one person.\n\nYou‘ll see users in the second column of the “Pages and screens” table we explored before. Right next to the number of views.\n\nNew Users\n\nNew users are visitors who are seeing your website for the first time.\n\nHaving a steady flow of new users indicates that your traffic acquisition efforts are working well. And it also means that the number of potential leads is increasing.\n\nTo see this metric, go to your GA4 account.\n\nIn the menu on the left, click “Acquisition” > “Overview.”\n\nYou’ll get an overview of both users and new users. And in the top right corner, you can choose a specific time frame to analyze.\n\nBounce Rate\n\nBounce rate shows the percentage of all sessions on your website that were unengaged. Here’s how Google defines engaged sessions:\n\nAn engaged session is a session that lasts longer than 10 seconds, has a conversion event, or has at least 2 pageviews or screenviews.\n\nWhen a page has a high bounce rate, there could be an issue you may need to assess and fix.\n\nFor example, your content may not be aligned with what the user’s looking for. Or, your website might have a technical problem that affects how quickly the page loads.\n\nIn GA4, the bounce rate isn’t visible by default. Add it on your own by customizing specific reports. \n\nTo do that, you’ll need to have Editor or Administrator access to a GA4 account. \n\nIn the menu on the left, click “Reports,” then choose a report you want to customize. For example, “Pages and screens.”\n\nIn the top right corner, click on the pen symbol to customize the report.\n\nClick “Metrics.”\n\nClick the “Add metric” field and enter “bounce rate.” Then, click on the metric once it shows up in the menu.\n\nClick “Apply” to save your customization.\n\nYou’ll now see the bounce rate metric in your report.\n\nTraffic Sources\n\nTraffic sources show you how many users come from each specific type of traffic source (e.g., organic search results, social media, email, etc.).\n\nThis content marketing metric can help you discover the most and least effective marketing channels for specific content. \n\nFor example, let’s say you’re working on increasing organic traffic to your website. \n\nIf your content gets little traffic from organic search and significantly more traffic from other sources, you may need to revisit your SEO efforts.\n\nTo see traffic sources, go to GA4. In the menu on the left, click “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”\n\nYou’ll see metrics for different groups of traffic sources like organic social and referral traffic.\n\nGo a step further and identify specific platforms and websites that bring traffic to your website.\n\nClick “Session primary channel group (Default Channel Group).” Once the drop-down menu opens up, select “Session source / medium.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of sources (platforms and websites) and their medium (which channel group they belong to). Like this:\n\nSEO & Visibility Metrics\n\nSEO metrics show how well your website is ranking in search engine results and driving organic traffic.\n\nOrganic Traffic\n\nOrganic traffic refers to the number of sessions your website gets from organic search.\n\nThis metric will show you how successful your SEO strategy is and whether you’re optimizing your content properly.\n\nTo see organic traffic measured in sessions, log in to your Google Analytics account.\n\nIn the menu on the left, click “Reports” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic Acquisition.”\n\nYou’ll see a broad overview of traffic sources for your website.\n\nLet’s see which search engines visitors use to find your website. \n\nFirst, click on the blue “+” to the right of “Session default channel group.” \n\nThen, search for “Session source” and choose it from the drop-down menu.\n\nYou’ll see sources of traffic for all types of channels. Let’s narrow it down.\n\nType “organic search” in the search bar and press “Enter” or “return” on your keyboard.\n\nNow, you’ll see how many organic sessions your website gets from each search engine.\n\nCheck out our organic traffic in GA4 guide to learn more about analyzing it with different dimensions and metrics.\n\nDwell Time\n\nDwell time refers to the amount of time users’ coming from search spend on a page before going back to the search engine results page (SERP).\n\nAnalyzing dwell time on your pages can help you understand if your content is addressing search intent—the reason behind searchers’ queries. \n\nThere’s no official metric or formula to calculate dwell time, but the new GA4 metric “Average engagement time per session” comes pretty close. \n\nLet’s explore:\n\nLog in to your Google Analytics account. In the menu on the left, click “Reports” > “Engagement” > “Landing page.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of pages that users “land on” first when visiting your website.\n\nThe metric “Average engagement time per session” shows how long a user was engaged on your website before leaving. \n\nNote that we don’t know whether they went back to search results, closed the tab, or went to another site.\n\nRight now, we’re seeing metrics for all traffic sources. Let’s narrow it down so it’s showing results just for people coming from search.\n\nClick on the blue “+” sign next to “Landing page.”\n\nOnce the menu opens up, click “Traffic source” > “Cross-channel” (in the “Session-scoped” section) > “Session default channel group.”\n\nNow, type “organic search” in the search bar to see only the metrics for organic traffic.\n\nOut of this list, the pages that have a low “Average engagement time per session” can be considered to have a low dwell time.\n\nKeyword Rankings\n\nKeyword rankings show the position of your pages in search results for their target search terms.\n\nFollowing your keyword rankings lets you know whether your content is getting visibility among your target readers.\n\nAnd if you notice some sudden drops in your rankings, you can react quickly. And examine what the issue is before it becomes a bigger problem.\n\nSemrush’s Position Tracking makes it easy for you to track a large number of keywords for your website.\n\nHere’s how to set it up:\n\nGo to the tool, enter your domain, and click “Set up tracking.”\n\nChoose the parameters you want to track rankings for. Like search engine, device type, location, and language.\n\nClick “Continue To Keywords.”\n\nEnter the keywords you want to track, click “Add keywords to campaign,” and select “Start Tracking.”\n\nThe tool will generate a list of your website’s positions in search results. And how those rankings change over time.\n\nPosition Tracking also allows you to add more keywords to your tracking campaign in the future.\n\nTrack Your Rankings with Ease\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nAuthority Score\n\nAuthority Score (AS) is a Semrush metric that represents a website's online reputation and SEO performance. It’s expressed as a number on a scale ranging from 0 to 100.\n\nThe metric takes into account these factors:\n\nLink power: The number and quality of backlinks a website has\nOrganic traffic: Estimated monthly organic traffic\nSpam factors: Whether a website has an unnatural amount of low-quality backlinks\n\nCheck your website’s Authority Score with Backlink Analytics.\n\nEnter your domain. Then, click “Analyze.”\n\nYou’ll see a report like this:\n\nIn the “Authority Score” section, you’ll see the number grading your website and a graph analyzing the three contributing factors (link power, organic traffic, and spam factors).\n\nNext to the number, there’s a blurb that will give you more information about your domain. Hover over it to see more.\n\nWhy is AS helpful?\n\nBecause it helps you understand your chances of ranking highly. And whether you need to engage in activities like link building. Which we’ll go over next.\n\nBacklinks\n\nBacklinks are links from other websites that point to your website. And it’s one of the key factors Google uses to evaluate and rank websites in search results.\n\nCheck the number of backlinks any website has with Backlink Analytics. You can even evaluate a specific page like a valuable resource you’re hoping will attract attention as part of a link building campaign.\n\nEnter the URL of the page you want to check. Then, click “Analyze.”\n\nThis URL has 192 backlinks from 99 referring domains.\n\nHaving a higher number of backlinks than referring domains means that some of these sites link to your page more than once. \n\nIf a page you created for PR and link building purposes isn’t getting links from topically relevant and authoritative websites like this, you may need to engage in direct outreach or another link building tactic. \n\nGet Insights on Backlink Profiles\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nMentions\n\nMentions are whenever your brand is mentioned online—on social media and other websites.\n\nKeeping track of brand mentions can help you understand how much brand awareness you have. And gauge the sentiment around your business.\n\nEasily stay on top of your mentions with Brand Monitoring.\n\nGo to Brand Monitoring, click “New query,” then select \"Brand.”\n\nEnter your brand name and an email address where you want to receive notifications about new mentions.\n\nScroll down to fill out other relevant information. \n\nFor example, you can add your domain to track backlinks. Or specify the country where the mentions are coming from.\n\nNext, click “Create query.”\n\nThe tool will generate a report with existing online mentions of your brand. \n\nAnd you’ll receive emails with new mentions. Which you can set to be daily, weekly, monthly, etc.\n\nRevenue-Related Metrics\n\nRevenue-related metrics show whether your content is supporting your business’s financial goals.\n\nNumber of New Leads\n\nA sales lead is a potential client who’s shared their contact details with you. They could do that by signing up for a free trial, downloading some free material on your website, inquiring through a contact form, etc.\n\nGenerating new leads through your content is a good sign you’re on the path to getting more customers.\n\nTrack your leads using ImpactHero.\n\nYou’ll easily be able to see how many users you’ve converted in a dashboard like this:\n\nImpactHero can also help you understand what kind of content performs best at different stages of the buyer’s journey. Including which pieces bring in the most leads.\n\nConversion Rate\n\nConversion rate represents the percentage of users that land on your site and complete a desired action (e.g., buy, download, click, sign up, etc.).\n\nMeasuring conversion rate is essential to understanding how effective your content marketing funnel is. And whether there’s room for improvement.\n\nYou can track conversion rates in Google Analytics. You’ll need to set them up first, so follow these steps if you haven’t done this yet.\n\nNow, let’s explore where to find conversions in GA4.\n\nIn the left-hand menu, click “Reports” > “Engagement” > “Conversions.”\n\nYou’ll see a breakdown of all the different conversion events you’re tracking. \n\nThe conversion rate won’t be available by default, but you can add it to the report if you have Editor or Administrator access to the GA account.\n\nClick on the pen icon in the top right corner to customize the report.\n\nClick “Metrics.”\n\nSelect the “Add metrics” field and look for “conversion rate.”\n\nYou’ll notice there are two metrics:\n\nSession conversion rate: Shows the percentage of converted sessions\nUser conversion rate: Shows the percentage of converted users\n\nAdd them both and click “Apply.”\n\nYou’ll now be able to see these two metrics in your report.\n\nNote\n\nThis method provides information about your site-wide conversion rates. If you want details for specific pages, you’ll want to add these metrics to the “Pages and screens” report. \n\nContent ROI\n\nContent return on investment (ROI) represents a correlation between the revenue you gained from content and the resources you invested in content production and distribution. To help you see whether your content marketing efforts are paying off.\n\nIf your ROI is high, it can help you advocate for more resources. And if it’s low, take action toward maximizing results.\n\nThe most common formula for calculating content ROI is:\n\nContent ROI = ((Return - Total Content Investment) / Total Content Investment) x 100\n\nThe final number is represented as a percentage.\n\nLet’s say your blog content generated $10,000 in sales, and you invested $2,500 in content production and distribution. \n\nThat means your blog content ROI would be 300%.\n\nContent Production Metrics\n\nContent production metrics help you optimize your editorial processes.\n\nTime to Publish\n\nTime to publish refers to the time it takes from coming up with a content idea to the publication of the content piece. \n\nMonitoring time to publish helps content managers stay on top of their workflows and identify potential bottlenecks in content production.\n\nIf it takes a long time to publish a piece, there could be issues within the workflow you need to identify. \n\nFor example, the briefs could be unclear, the topics may be challenging, or there might be specific team members who are late with their delivery.\n\nKeep in mind this metric will greatly depend on your content editorial standards, the number of revisions, and other factors. There’s no specific number to aim for, but tracking it will help you identify specific situations to address.\n\nHere’s an example of what a workflow might look like:\n\nAs you can see, there are numerous steps where slow-downs could occur.\n\nProduction Cost\n\nProduction cost refers to how much money you allocate for creating content. And you can measure it for all your content as well as for specific pieces.\n\nMeasuring production cost helps with calculating ROI. And is essential for making data-driven decisions about which content to invest in.\n\nFor example, let’s say an article costs a lot to create but doesn’t drive the desired results. You might want to have a look at similar topics in your content strategy and evaluate whether it makes sense for you to cover them.\n\nDistribution Cost\n\nDistribution cost refers to how much money you’re spending to distribute and promote your content.\n\nThis cost could involve paid ads on Google and Meta platforms, distributing press releases to a PR wire network, collaborating with influencers who promote your content, and a lot more.\n\nTracking distribution costs is critical for calculating ROI. And lets you see whether certain channels are more cost-effective than others.\n\nEngagement Metrics\n\nEngagement metrics give you insights into whether your content is resonating with your audience.\n\nAverage Engagement Time\n\nAverage engagement time shows how long an active visitor (someone whose primary focus is on your website) stays on your site.\n\nA longer average engagement time can indicate that your content resonates with your target audience. And that it matches search intent.\n\nYou can view this metric in Google Analytics.\n\nGo to your GA4 account. And then click “Engagement” > “Overview.”\n\nYou’ll see average engagement time across your entire website for the specified time frame.\n\nTo see numbers for specific pages, scroll down.\n\nClick “View pages and screens” in the “Views by Page title and screen class” section.\n\nA table showing the pages on your website will open up. The “Average engagement time” column will show you how long active users stayed on your site based on the pages they visited.\n\nReactions, Shares, and Comments\n\nThese metrics refer to how many social media users reacted to (which includes likes), shared, and commented on your content.\n\nBy analyzing these metrics across your social content, you’ll learn what kind of posts your audience likes the most.\n\nKeep track of these metrics across several platforms in Semrush Social.\n\nFollow these configuration instructions to connect your Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn accounts.\n\nNow, let’s explore engagement metrics for Instagram.\n\nClick on the “Instagram” tab in Social Analytics.\n\nThen, click “Posts” to explore the number of likes, shares, and comments your posts get. And find the best- and worst-performing ones.\n\nThe insights you gain from doing this can inform your future social media content. So you create more of what your audience enjoys.\n\nCreate a Content Performance Monitoring Dashboard\n\nSetting up a content performance dashboard will help you keep track of important metrics in a single place. \n\nSemrush’s Organic Traffic Insights tool helps you achieve that by combining data from Google Analytics, Google Search Console (GSC), and Semrush.\n\nTo set it up, open the tool, enter your domain name, and click “Get Insights.”\n\nNext, click “Connect Google Account.”\n\nYou’ll be taken to a login page where you need to choose an account you want to connect to. This is the email address that’s connected to your GA4 and GSC.\n\nReview the terms and conditions, then click “Continue.”\n\nReview the permissions, then click “Allow.”\n\nNext, you’ll be taken back to the Semrush interface. Where you’ll connect your Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts.\n\nOnce setup is complete, you’ll see the metrics from these three sources combined in one dashboard. \n\nYou can see many of the metrics we’ve covered: keyword rankings, users, average engagement time, engagement rate, etc.\n\nAnd a great feature in this dashboard is the keywords from the Google Search Console.\n\nView a list of all the keywords driving traffic to a particular page by clicking the number in the “GSC” column for the page you want to analyze.\n\nAnalyze the search terms you see here.\n\nIf you notice ones that are relevant but you haven’t targeted, consider adding them to that content when you update it in the future.\n\nYou can also see which pages are ranking well but aren’t getting many clicks. \n\nMaybe these pages could perform better if you improve their title tags (HTML that indicates the page title and might show in search results) and meta descriptions (HTML that provides a brief page summary and may show in search results).\n\nCombine GA, GSC, and Semrush Data\n\nwith the Organic Traffic Insights Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nStart Measuring Content Performance\n\nTracking content performance is a key step to understanding your audience, the impact you’re creating, and how to improve.\n\nAnd tools like Semrush can make the measuring process a lot easier. \n\nSign up for a free seven-day trial and gain access to:\n\nPosition Tracking: Monitor your keyword rankings\nBacklink Analytics: Track the number of backlinks you have\nOrganic Traffic Insights: Get a comprehensive look at content performance\n\nAnd a lot more.\n\nElevate Your Digital Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
