  "content": "What Is Market Share?\n\nMarket share is the percentage of a particular market served by a particular company. It indicates how dominant the company is in its niche and what potential it has for growth.\n\nMore specifically, market share usually refers to revenue market share. (The portion of total industry revenue attributed to a company.)\n\nFor example, a company that generates half of its industry’s revenue has a 50% market share.\n\nBut you can also measure your market share of specific metrics like:\n\nMonthly active users\nWebsite traffic\nUnit sales\n\nAnalyses are always based on a certain time scale (e.g., the last financial year). And can also be restricted based on geographic areas, consumer demographics, etc.\n\nIt all depends on what's useful for your analysis.\n\nWhat Is Relative Market Share?\n\nRelative market share shows what proportion of the market you serve compared to your strongest rival. It helps you understand your competitive standing.\n\nFor example, if you generate half as much revenue as the industry leader, your relative market share is 50%. \n\nAs with standard market share, you can calculate your relative market share of different metrics, for different time ranges, and for different segments.\n\nWhat Is the Market Share Formula?\n\nThe standard market share formula is:\n\nMarket share percentage = (company revenue / market revenue) x 100\n\nLet’s say the U.S. smartphone industry generated $80 billion of revenue last year.\n\nIf Apple generated $40 billion of those sales, it had 50% market share—(40 billion / 80 billion) x 100 = 50.\n\nTo make market share calculations of specific metrics, use this formula:\n\nMarket share percentage of metric = (company metric / market metric) x 100\n\nLet’s say the smartphone industry made 1.2 billion shipments last year.\n\nIf Apple made 240 million of those shipments, it had 20% market share—(240 million / 1.2 billion) x 100 = 20.\n\nAnd this is the relative market share formula: \n\nRelative market share percentage = (company market share / strongest competitor’s market share) x 100\n\nLet’s say Apple is the market leader with a 25% market share. And its biggest competitor is Samsung, with a 20% market share.\n\nApple’s relative market share is 125%—(25 / 20) x 100). This means they’re the market leader. And their market share is 25% larger than their strongest competitor’s.\nSamsung’s relative market share is 80%—(20 / 25) x 100). Their market share is 20% smaller than their biggest competitor’s.\nHow to Calculate Market Share\n\nTo determine market share, you need to divide your company metric (e.g., revenue) by the equivalent market metric. Then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nBut what data should you use? And where can you find it?\n\nLet’s explain how to calculate market share of different values step by step. We’ll also share a free template you can use.\n\nTip\n\nIf you want to calculate your share of online traffic, visit the next section for the quickest method.\n\n1. Source Market Data\n\nThe market share calculations you can make are typically limited by the market data available. \n\nSo, we recommend that you collect market data first. And work from there.\n\nPotential sources include market research tools, databases, and industry reports.\n\nA Google search like this can help you find the data you’re interested in:\n\nIf you can’t find data for your niche, try collating it yourself.\n\nFor example, you can download your competitors’ financial reports. Then, combine their revenue figures with your own to get a market revenue estimate.\n\nMarket revenue estimate = your revenue + competitors’ revenue\n\nSame goes for other metrics, like unit sales.\n\nThe more competitors you collect data from, the more accurate your market share calculation will be.\n\n2. Collect Equivalent Company Data\n\nOnce you’ve collected your market data, you need to collect the equivalent data from your company.\n\nFor example, market revenue and your company’s revenue should relate to the same time range and geographic location. \n\nIf you don’t use like-for-like data in your market share calculations, you won’t get a valid result.\n\n3. Apply the Market Share Formula\n\nAll that’s left is to use your data in the market share formula for your chosen metric.\n\nAs a reminder, it looks like this:\n\nMarket share percentage of a metric = (company metric / market metric) x 100\n\nIf you want to make sure you get things right, make a copy of our market share calculator in Google Sheets.\n\nSimply input your market and company data in the upper table.\n\nOr fill out the lower table with your own and your competitors’ data. This allows you to calculate a market data estimate and see each company’s market share.\n\n(We’ve provided enough space for nine competitors, but you can add or delete rows if necessary. Just make sure to adjust the formulas accordingly.)\n\nHow to Calculate Traffic Share\n\nTraffic share (or web traffic share) represents the portion of visits that go to your website out of all the website visits made in your industry. \n\nThis helps you understand how strong your business’s online presence is.\n\nAnd with Semrush’s Market Explorer tool, you can calculate your traffic share in seconds.\n\nJust click “Find Competitors,” choose your location, and enter your domain.\n\nThen, click “Research a market.”\n\nThe tool will identify your biggest traffic competitors and conduct a market analysis. (Based on the time scale and location selected at the top.)\n\nGo to “All Domains” to see your own and your competitors’ share of traffic:\n\nOr go to “Benchmarking” and choose up to five domains to compare.\n\nIn the table, you can see each acquisition channels’ share of traffic:\n\nTotal: Visits from any channel\nDirect: Visits made when users type the URL into a browser or use a bookmark \nReferral: Visits from links on external domains\nOrganic Search: Visits from unpaid search engine links\nPaid Search: Visits from search engine advertisements\nOrganic Social: Visits from unpaid social media links\nPaid Social: Visits from social media advertisements\nEmail: Visits from email links\nDisplay Ads: Visits from display advertisements (e.g., banner ads)\n\nIf your market share is low in a particular area, it suggests you’re missing out on potential traffic. So, you might want to revisit your marketing strategy.\n\nFor example, if you have a relatively small traffic share in organic search, consider investing more in search engine optimization (SEO).\n\nMarket Explorer (and your Semrush .Trends subscription) also gives you access to a variety of other insights. So, make sure to explore all the tools and reports.\n\nAnalyze Your Traffic Share\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nHow to Increase Your Market Share\n\nIncreasing market share is about getting customers to choose you over competitors.\n\nHere are eight tactics you should know about:\n\nOutrank Your Competitors in Search Results\n\nOutranking your competitors for relevant search engine queries (or keywords) is one of the best ways to divert valuable traffic from their sites to your site. To contribute to a higher share of sales.\n\nYou can find opportunities with Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool.\n\nEnter your domain and a competitor’s domain.\n\nThen, choose your country and click “Compare.”\n\nScroll down to the keyword table and click the “Weak” tab. This shows keywords that the competitor outranks you for.\n\nYou can see both of your positions in the table. \n\nIt’s a good idea to prioritize keywords that:\n\nYou already have a high ranking for (so you have fewer positions to gain)\nHave a high search volume (so the potential traffic gains are higher)\nHave with a low difficulty score (this suggests it’ll be easier to improve your ranking)\n\nCheck out our guide for detailed advice on improving your Google rankings.\n\nCompare Your Rankings with Competitors’\n\nwith the Keyword Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUse a Competitive Pricing Strategy\n\nPricing is often one of the main factors in buying decisions. Especially when it comes to products that are available from multiple stores.\n\nIf you reassure customers that you’re never beaten on price (like Best Buy does), you may be more likely to secure sales.\n\nYou’ll just need to make sure that this approach works for your brand identity—and your financial model.\n\nIf you can’t commit to permanently lower prices, try enticing customers with special offers and sales.\n\nOnce you have the customer on your books, they may be more likely to buy again. \n\nCommunicate a Unique Selling Proposition\n\nA unique selling proposition (USP) explains what separates you from your competitors. Or what makes you special.\n\nSome key elements of Apple’s USP include:\n\nDesign excellence\nUser-friendly interfaces\nEmphasis on privacy and security\n\nCreating and communicating a strong value proposition gives customers a reason to choose your brand. So, it can play a key role in increasing your market share.\n\nBe Innovative\n\nWhether it’s introducing new product features or bringing a new service to the market, innovations can help your business stand out from the crowd. And solve consumer needs that no one else can.\n\nYou’ll need to conduct market research to make informed decisions about any needed research and development (R&D) designed to fuel innovation.\n\nFor example, you can use surveys to gather feedback about your ideas. And monitor trends in consumer sentiments and behaviors. \n\nStrengthen Customer Loyalty\n\nThe stronger your customer loyalty, the less likely you are to lose market share to competitors.\n\nNot only are loyal customers more likely to make repeat purchases (or stay subscribed to your service), but they’re also more likely to recommend your brand to others.\n\nHere are some of the best ways to build loyalty:\n\nDeliver great customer service\nLaunch rewards and referral programs\nOffer exclusive deals to existing customers\nSolicit and act upon customer feedback\n\nOne of the best ways to keep previous customers engaged is through email marketing. Check out our guide for advice on making it work for your brand.\n\nTarget New Demographics\n\nExpanding your target audience into new demographics can be one of the most effective ways to increase your market share.\n\nConsider the story of the Stanley Quencher.\n\nThis durable water bottle was originally marketed to construction workers and outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nBut when the company pivoted to targeting women, sales skyrocketed. \n\nThe strategy shift helped Stanley grow its annual revenue from $70 million to $750 million in four years, CNBC reported.\n\nAcquire Your Competitors\n\nIf you have the capital available, acquiring or merging with a competitor could be the most efficient way to increase your market share.\n\nFor example, Facebook (now Meta) acquired WhatsApp to strengthen its position in the messaging space.\n\nWhile Sephora acquired Feelunique to support its expansion into the U.K. market.\n\nLearn from Key Players in Your Industry\n\nBy analyzing the key players in your industry, you can discover ways to emulate their success. And identify gaps in the market.\n\nThen, use these insights to increase your market share.\n\nHere are some of the best tools for competitive analyses:\n\nTraffic Analytics: Learn where your competitors get their traffic from and what audiences they attract.
