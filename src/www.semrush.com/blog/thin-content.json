  "content": "What Is Thin Content?\n\nThin content refers to website pages that offer visitors little or no added value.\n\nIn other words, they don't answer search intent or help users complete a task.\n\nThin content pages can have a low word count. But other types of thin content include:\n\nThin affiliate pageswith little original content, primarily focused on promoting affiliate products without adding substantial value\nContent copied from other sources without permission or attribution, offering no unique insights\nPages created solely to rank for specific keywords, often leading to similar or duplicate content within the site\nPosts written by guests that lack expertise, originality, or relevance to your site's audience\nLow-quality AI-generated content\n\nThin content violates Google's spam policies, which can lead to penalties (manual actions). And it can significantly impact your search engine optimization (SEO).\n\nGoogle's crackdown on thin content began with the 2011 Panda algorithm update. It aimed to lower the rank of sites with poor content quality and improve user experience (UX). \n\nAlthough the Panda update is over 12 years old, Google still uses its core values as part of its ranking systems today.\n\nFor example, you may be familiar with the concept of E-E-A-T.\n\nE-E-A-T stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.\n\nGoogle uses E-E-A-T as part of its search rater guidelines to help raters evaluate whether their search ranking systems provide helpful, relevant information. \n\nThat’s why getting rid of thin content is crucial.\n\nHow Thin Content Hurts Your SEO\n\nBeyond violating Google's guidelines, thin content negatively affects your SEO strategy in multiple ways:\n\nThin content offers bad user experience. It fails to engage visitors and signals to search engines that your content isn't valuable.\nThin content is often poorly organized and lacks structure. This makes it hard for users to find the information they need.\nMultiple pages targeting the same keywords can lead to keyword cannibalization. Which can confuse search engines about which page to rank.\n\nGoogle has two main ways of finding and penalizing thin content: \n\nAlgorithmically, through core updates and ranking systems\nBy issuing a manual penalty\n\nRanking systems now prioritize helpful, reliable, people-first content created to benefit people rather than just gain SEO rankings.\n\nThe Google algorithm is constantly moving around search results. But the algorithm isn’t perfect. \n\nThat is why sometimes it will issue a manual penalty. \n\nTypical characteristics of \"SEO content\" that Google aims to devalue include:\n\nPrimarily created to manipulate search rankings rather than help users\nLacking original information or insights\nCopied or rewritten from other sources without adding value\nNot demonstrating expertise in the topic\n\nFurther reading: Quality Content: What It Is + 10 Actionable Tips for Success\n\nTypes of Thin Content\n\nThere are many different types of thin content. Here are a few of the most common: \n\n1. Content That Isn’t Helpful\n\nGoogle's ranking systems prioritize content that is informative, trustworthy, and genuinely helpful to users. Thin content doesn't meet these criteria and is often seen as lacking E-E-A-T. \n\nIt might also lack depth or usefulness and fail to delve deep enough into the topic.\n\nFor example, a travel guide for a city that only lists a few popular landmarks without providing details on transportation, local customs, or hidden gems would fall short. \n\nThis content may be too short, lack original insights, or simply rehash information readily available elsewhere.\n\nTo ensure your content is truly helpful, consider these questions:\n\nDoes the content provide original information, research, or analysis?\nIs the author or creator clearly identified?\nDoes the content come from a reputable source?\nIs the content well-written and free of errors?\nDoes the content provide value compared to other content on the same topic?\n\nFurther reading: Check out Google’s guidelines on creating helpful content for a full list of self-evaluating questions.\n\n2. Poorly Written Content\n\nIf your blog articles or webpages contain grammatical errors, typos, or awkward phrasing, Google might perceive them as low-quality or thin content. \n\nThink of it like this: \n\nWould you trust a restaurant with a menu full of spelling mistakes and food descriptions that don't make sense? \n\nProbably not. \n\nThe same principle applies to your website. \n\nEven if you have valuable information to share, poor writing can make it difficult for readers to engage with your content, leading them to seek more polished alternatives.\n\nLet’s say you write an article because you want to rank for a specific search query. \n\nYou don’t think about teaching the audience anything. And instead of creating a helpful guide, you force in the keywords repeatedly. \n\nYou’d end up with a piece of content like this:\n\nThis example is older since most bloggers no longer write like this. \n\nThis content is thin because it lacks a real strategy or flow and is laden with grammatical errors. \n\nHowever, important pages for ecommerce businesses can also be deemed “thin” for the same reasons.\n\nFor example, shopping carts and category pages. These may not appear to Google to be valuable for the same reasons.\n\nIn those cases, you can use the “noindex” directive to tell Google not to rank them. \n\n3. Low-Quality Affiliate Content\n\nAffiliate marketing is a performance-based advertising method. Businesses pay people or other companies a commission on conversions they acquire.\n\nIn other words, you can earn money by promoting other people’s products without holding any stock.\n\nAffiliate marketing is a legitimate arrangement. Done right, you can use it to make passive income or acquire targeted traffic of your own.\n\nHere’s a good example of how home barista site Homegrounds includes affiliate links in its handy guides:\n\nThis is the URL to Atlas Coffee Club that pops up when you click the title:\n\nhttps://atlascoffeeclub.com/?ref_coupon=HOMEGROUNDS&utm_source=pepperjam&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=164971&utm_content=3-211372&clickId=4428030818\n\nThe URL is so long because it’s tracking where visitors to Atlas came from. This one shows it’s an affiliate link from Homegrounds.\n\nWhenever a visitor comes from the Homegrounds site and makes a purchase on Atlas, Homegrounds will get a commission.\n\nIf Homegrounds used thin affiliate content, they would simply copy the wording on Atlas Coffee Club’s homepage:\n\nInstead, they explain in their own words why they think Atlas Coffee Club is so great.\n\nTo avoid Google labeling your affiliate pages as “thin,” you need to create a clear connection between both sites.\n\nPlus, you need to add value with original content.\n\nOtherwise, what new information is your affiliate site offering that the original isn’t?\n\nIf you're unsure whether your affiliate content is hitting the mark, check out Google's guidelines on creating high-quality reviews. \n\nThey offer some handy tips, like evaluating your content from a user's perspective, demonstrating your expertise, and providing evidence to support your claims.\n\n4. Scraped Content \n\nScraped content is simply content copied from other sources without permission or attribution. \n\nThis can range from outright copying and pasting to slightly modifying the original text using synonyms or automated techniques. \n\nIt's like taking someone else's recipe and passing it off as your own—it is a form of plagiarism and offers no unique value to readers. \n\nThink of it this way: \n\nImagine finding two websites with the exact same information. Which one would you trust more? \n\nIt's probably the one who wrote it first. That's because the original creator spent time and effort sharing their knowledge.\n\nSearch engines like Google are smart enough to spot scraped content and can punish websites that use it by making them harder to find in search results. \n\nIf you're worried someone is stealing your content, you can use a tool like Copyscape to find copies online.\n\nFor example, we found a website copying from our Semrush homepage:\n\nAnd if we check this website in Semrush’s Organic Research tool, we can see the website has zero visibility in search engines.\n\n5. Pages With Too Many Ads\n\nWhile ads are common for websites to generate revenue, too many can create a poor user experience. \n\nThink of it like a billboard-filled highway: Too much visual noise can be overwhelming and detract from the journey itself. \n\nThis popular Reddit thread clearly shows that many users find excessive ads frustrating and disruptive to their browsing experience.\n\nWhen ads dominate a webpage, they can distract from the main content, slow down loading times, and even make it difficult to navigate the site. \n\nGoogle recognizes the importance of a positive user experience and may penalize websites that overload their pages with excessive advertising.\n\nThis aligns with Lily Ray's observation in her tweet that many websites experiencing ranking drops after the March 2024 core update (which apparently targeted spammy, low-quality content) are publisher sites relying heavily on ad revenue.\n\nStriking a balance between monetization and user experience is crucial. \n\nAds should complement your content—not overshadow it.\n\n6. Duplicate Content\n\nGoogle may view duplicate content (with the same titles, page content, and meta descriptions) as another type of thin page. \n\nThis can apply to content copied from other sites, as well as content that’s the same across your own site.\n\nAnd swapping a few words alone won’t distinguish the pages as separate content.\n\nFor example, sticking to the same sentence format but using synonyms:\n\nGoogle dislikes multiple versions of the same content. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it doesn’t want to show users the same results and waste crawling resources. The search engine is all about answering users’ questions as quickly as possible.\n\nBut what about those times you’re duplicating on purpose? \n\nFor example, you need to show the same content on your category and product pages.\n\nIn these cases, you can “tell” Google it's intentional with a snippet of code. Canonical tags point from the alternate page (the duplicate) to the preferred page.\n\nThese tags prevent Google from penalizing intentional pages.\n\n7. Doorway Pages\n\nDoorway pages are pages of low-quality content that try to rank by stuffing in keywords or links to low-value sites. People usually create them to increase their site’s footprint in the SERPs with less effort.\n\nThese exist to funnel visitors to other pages. And doorway pages are usually full of keyword variations, links, or ads.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nImage Source: Search Engine Land\n\nThere’s no unique value here. This page’s sole purpose is to direct users to these linked pages.\n\nPeople can create doorway pages to manipulate search engines deliberately. Or by accident because they don’t realize the content is thin.\n\nGoogle can also mislabel legitimate pages as doorways.\n\nFor example, these variations on the Hertz van hire landing page might look suspicious at first glance:\n\nBut in this case, each landing page creates clarity for users. \n\nThe service may be the same. But people looking for van hire in London will need different information from those in Belfast.\n\n8. Pages With Spammy or Irrelevant Links\n\nPeople use spammy links to manipulate search engines and gain traction in the SERPs. For instance, buying links on other sites or selling your own.\n\nHere’s an example from Google’s Spam Policies of what that looks like:\n\nThese links to commercial pages are “thin” because the writer doesn’t use them meaningfully or teach anything useful.\n\nLinks help Google determine how relevant a webpage is to a search query. \n\nThey’re also how search engine crawlers move around your site and understand the hierarchy:\n\nUsing them deceptively or incorrectly is a fast way to drop down the SERPs. \n\nHow to Identify Thin Content\n\nThere are three main ways to check if your site content is thin:\n\n1. Check Google Search Console and Analytics\n\nCheck to see if Google has hit you with any manual action penalties by logging into Google Search Console. \n\nHead to the “Security & Manual Actions” tab in the sidebar. \n\nThen click “Manual actions” to reveal any penalties:\n\nYou’ll see a list of issues you need to fix or a message that says “No issues detected.” \n\nOnce you update your thin content, you can request a review in Search Console. The webspam team will check your changes and (if sufficient) may remove your penalty.\n\nOnce your manual actions are clear, head to Google Analytics to check for additional thin content. \n\nHere, you want to study your organic traffic and look out for any drops. \n\nThese dips could be due to: \n\nPrevious manual actions\nAlgorithm changes\nSeasonality\nReporting glitches\n\nYou’re looking for patterns like those on the left where a drop in traffic doesn’t bounce back:\n\nBoth of these reasons for a drop in traffic may result from thin content.\n\nAssess both types of “technical issue” drops and note which pages aren’t getting any visitors. \n\nThey could be the cause.\n\nIf traffic is consistently low for these pages, note them in your spreadsheet and include them in your read-through.\n\n2. Run a Site Audit and Fix Technical Issues\n\nPerform a full site audit with a tool like Semrush’s Site Audit to highlight technical issues causing thin or low-quality pages, specifically those caused by duplicate content. \n\nTo set up an audit, you first need to create a project.\n\nNext, you’ll need to set up your audit. There are quite a few steps to that. So, check out our guide for a more detailed walkthrough.\n\nOnce you’ve created your project and configured your audit, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nThe tool then crawls your pages. \n\nAnd the Site Audit dashboard will look like this:\n\nThe SiteHealth score will indicate the overall technical health of your website. \n\nWe base this metric on the number of issues found and their seriousness.\n\nSite Audit divides issues into three categories:\n\nErrors (most severe)\nWarnings (medium severity)\nNotices (least severe)\n\nUse these distinctions to prioritize your fixes. \n\nYou’ll also find a “Thematic Reports” section that allows you to examine various aspects of your technical SEO.\n\nTo see all your site’s problems in one place, click on the “Issues” tab at the top of your site audit dashboard.\n\nThen, review the issues and start fixing them. \n\nClicking on each will show you all the audited URLs the issue affects.\n\nYou may encounter:\n\nDuplicate content issues\nInternal linking issues \nRedirect issues\nTitle tag issues\nPerformance issues\n\nIf unsure where to start, click the “Why and how to fix it” link next to an issue.\n\nYou’ll get an explanation and a short how-to guide for each optimization.\n\nOnce you’ve fixed everything, you’ll know technical issues aren’t responsible for any thin content issues.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n3. Read Through Your Webpages\n\nRead through the content on your site like a new reader. \n\nHigh-quality content should teach readers something. They should understand:\n\nWhat you're explaining\nWhy it relates to the topic\nHow to do it \n\nIf your page doesn’t answer their questions, it’s likely thin content.\n\nIdentifying thin content through reading is a slow, manual process. But it’s necessary.\n\nCreate a spreadsheet to keep your content audit organized:\n\nCheck off the pieces of content you’ve read. And note the ones you’ll need to update. That way, you can stay on track.\n\nHow to Fix Thin Content\nAdd Value to It\n\nThe most direct way to fix thin content is to enrich it with valuable information. This can involve:\n\nExpanding on the topic: Dive deeper into the subject matter, providing more details, examples, data, or expert opinions. Aim for a comprehensive word count that covers the topic without adding unnecessary fluff.\nAnswering user intent: Consider your target audience's questions and address them directly in your content. Ensure your content aligns with the search intent behind their search queries.\nUpdating outdated information: If your content is old, run a content audit to identify outdated pieces. Then, refresh them with your industry's latest data, trends, or developments. \nIncorporating visuals: Break up large blocks of text with relevant images, infographics, or videos to enhance readability and provide additional information.\n\nFurther reading: Check out our guide on creating quality content for specific examples.\n\nRedirect It\n\nWhat do you do if you find unhelpful, irrelevant pages with no traffic? Redirect them to other pages or delete them. \n\nA 301 redirect is an HTTP status code indicating a permanently moved webpage. \n\nIt sends users and search engines from the old page to the new one. \n\nIf the older page has backlinks, redirecting it passes on some of the value you’ve gained there instead of losing it. \n\nSo, how do you implement a 301 redirect?\n\nIf you have a WordPress site, you can use the redirect manager in a plugin like Yoast SEO Premium. \n\nOr if you have a Shopify store, head to the “Navigation” tab in the drop-down menu.\n\nFollow our 301 redirect guide for a walkthrough of both and more options.\n\nIf you choose to delete content with a 404 code instead, users will see a page like this:\n\nWhile a 404 code lets search engines know to disregard the page, it’s not great for UX.\n\nThat’s why it’s often preferable to redirect if you can.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nCombine It With Other Content\n\nIf you have multiple pieces of thin content on similar topics, consider merging them into a comprehensive resource. \n\nLet’s say you have a short article called “Can dogs eat apples?” And another called “Can dogs eat bananas?”\n\nYou could combine the two into an ultimate guide called “Can dogs eat fruit?” Then, cover all the types of safe fruit to feed dogs.\n\nThis improves user experience and increases your SEO visibility for that page by targeting a wider range of relevant keywords related to the topic.\n\nRefocus it \n\nImplementing a keyword research strategy can help refocus thin content. \n\nThat’s because it increases the likelihood of answering user intent and teaching the reader something (the opposite of thin content).\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool can make this process a breeze.\n\nBefore you start, figure out your thin content’s central message. If it doesn’t have one, choose the closest related topic. \n\nYou’ll use this term as your seed term in the tool.\n\nLet’s say it’s “dogfood.” Start by entering it into the search bar.\n\nThen, enter your domain into the “AI-powered feature” field, choose your target location, and click “Search.”\n\nThis will generate a report with related keywords, each accompanied by valuable data: search intent, search volume, Personal Keyword Difficulty (PKD%), and Keyword Difficulty (KD%).\n\nKD% indicates how difficult it is to rank for a particular keyword\nPKD% considers your website's unique strength. And gives you a personalized score of how difficult it would be for your site to rank.\n\nThe left sidebar displays the most popular topics related to your seed keyword. \n\nIn this case, these are:\n\nBest (e.g., “best dog food”)\nDry (e.g., “dry dog food brands”)\nCan (e.g., “can dogs eat X”)\n\nClicking on one will show all the keywords relating to that topic.\n\nIf any topics aren't relevant to your content, hide them using the eye icon.\n\nClicking parent subgroups will show child group keywords. \n\nFor example, “can” + “puppy” + “eat” will show question-based keywords about the kinds of foods puppies can eat.\n\nNow, here's where the magic happens: \n\nClick on the \"PKD%\" drop-down menu and select \"Easy.\" \n\nThis will filter the results to show keywords that should be relatively easy for your site to rank for, provided you create high-quality content that aligns with the search intent.\n\nThis will filter the results to show keywords that should be relatively easy to rank with high-quality content focused on the search intent.\n\nFrom this refined list, choose a keyword that best reflects your desired topic and can attract relevant traffic. \n\nThis focused approach will help you revitalize your thin content and increase its visibility in search results.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nRepurpose It\n\nYou can also repackage thin content into a new format to make it more valuable and draw renewed attention. This is called repurposing.\n\nYou’ll likely have to optimize it first to add value (e.g., address recent trends, add new relevant sections, or go deeper into an explanation). Then, repurpose it.\n\nFor example, turn a written piece of content into a new multimedia version, like an infographic summarizing a blog post.\n\nInfographics combine engaging visuals with interesting data to draw the reader in. They can be a great addition to blog posts, making the value of the content more immediately apparent.\n\nFor instance, consider this infographic from our 10 SEO copywriting tips blog post:\n\nPlus, infographics are super shareable. So, you can get more visibility for your content when readers repost the images on X or Instagram.\n\nAnother way of repurposing thin content is to go deeper with video. For example, record a webinar or interview other guests using the narrative of your thin content to create talking points or questions.\n\nThis provides you with more opinions, information, and experiences for richer content.\n\nUpload the finished recording on the original page to boost its value.\n\nYou can even repurpose these recordings further into short clips for your own social media accounts.\n\nIn 2023, 90% of marketers said video content helped them generate leads. And 87% said it helped them increase sales.\n\nSo, it’s worth a shot.\n\nPro tip\n\nTo find posts to combine or repurpose, ask yourself three questions:\n \n\nDoes this content aid the marketing funnel?\nIs this content still relevant to the business?\nDoes this page receive any traffic?\n\nIf the answer is “yes” to each, it’s worth creating new content from these older posts. If the answer is “no,” consider redirecting or deleting the content (see the next section).\n\nTo streamline the repurposing process, consider using content repurposing tools like AI Video Marketing Automator, an app that lets you easily repurpose blog content into YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram videos.\n\nFurther reading: Repurposing Content: How to Get More Out of Every Piece\n\nDelete It\n\nYou can delete content that is completely useless, is out-of-date, or has no backlinks. \n\nThis helps tidy up your website and ensures search engines only see your best content.\n\nBefore you delete anything, check if the pages have any backlinks. \n\nIf they do, consider redirecting those pages so the backlinks still provide some SEO benefits. \n\nRedirecting means sending people who click the old link to a new, relevant page instead. Check out our guide to redirection for more information.\n\nYou will also want to double-check internal links pointing to the URL. Choose if you want to delete them or update them to the redirected page. \n\nFurther reading: Check out our content pruning guide to learn more about identifying and deleting low-value content.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nFind and Fix Thin Content on Your Site \n\nThe quickest and easiest way to start your “thin content” audit is to root out technical issues causing Google to label your site as “thin.”\n\nTake this first step by heading to the Site Audit tool and reviewing each issue individually.\n\nOnce you’ve done that, take your content quality to the next level with Semrush's suite of tools designed to streamline your content creation process:\n\nOrganic Research: Uncover your competitors' top-performing content and gain insights to refine your content strategy\nKeyword Magic Tool: Discover relevant keywords with lower competition to target and optimize your content for better search visibility\nKeyword Strategy Builder: Visualize and build an entire SEO content strategy using Topics and Pages\nSEO Writing Assistant: Get real-time feedback on your content's readability, originality, and tone of voice, ensuring it's clear, engaging, and optimized for search engines\n\nElevate Your Content Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
