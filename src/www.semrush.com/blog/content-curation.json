  "content": "What Is Content Curation?\n\nContent curation involves gathering and organizing content (like articles, videos, images, or audio) from various sources. \n\nThen sharing that content with your audience via social media posts, blogs, newsletters, email, and more.\n\nIn other words, you leverage existing content. So you don’t have to start from scratch.\n\nLike how we discovered this meme on Facebook and paired it with a caption that relates to our audience:\n\nBenefits of Content Curation\nSave Time and Money\n\nContent curation is an effective way to produce consistent content without breaking the bank.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you lean on existing content. And won’t need to create every idea yourself.\n\nThis lowers the cost of content creation—which is great news for teams with limited budgets and time constraints. \n\nBut beyond simplifying content creation, content curation offers several other advantages.\n\nExpand Your Content Strategy\n\nBusinesses can often struggle to maintain their content strategy—brainstorm ideas, create content, publish, repeat.\n\nOr find themselves only posting about their products and services.\n\nBut curated content lets you showcase various perspectives, insights, and opinions on topics relevant to your business. Without heavy lifting on brainstorming.\n\nThese different perspectives can spark conversation and encourage audience participation. Which is exactly what you want when your goal is to boost engagement.\n\n(And sometimes, curated content is meant to purely entertain your audience.)\n\nEditing app Grammarly does this by occasionally curating quotes. They post the quote to social media and ask their audience what they think. \n\nThis simple post generated over 900 comments and thousands of reactions. \n\nWhich keeps Grammarly’s audience engaged on a topic relevant to Grammarly’s product.\n\nBecome a Go-To Resource\n\nSearching for the right resources can be time-consuming.\n\nCurating top-notch content in your niche saves your audience the hassle of searching the web themselves. \n\nAnd they’ll appreciate knowing they can come to you when they want helpful information.\n\nFor example, we compiled the best tools for writers in the blog post below. This post saves our audience from searching for the tools themselves. And doing extensive research.\n\nStay Ahead of Trends\n\nActively curating content can help you uncover trends and insights. And provide a deeper understanding of your industry. \n\nThis insight can then guide your content marketing strategy. \n\nSay you notice people discussing a certain topic before that topic goes mainstream. You might want to create content around this topic if you sense it could gain momentum. \n\nFor example, news site Marketing Technology Solutions Review curates weekly news roundups for their readers. Which helps them stay on top of industry-related news.\n\nYou can also hop on trends for entertainment purposes. Like we did with this meme referencing the Beckham documentary on Netflix. \n\nWhich can help you stay up to date with your audience’s interests. \n\nImprove Search Engine Optimization \n\nContent curation can help you rank for more keywords. And get more traffic to your blog.\n\nCertain keywords work well with curated content. For example, people searching for the “best pumpkin recipes” likely want a listicle-style blog post of curated recipes using pumpkin. \n\nTo find keywords for listicle-style blog posts, use the Keyword Magic Tool. Start by entering a broad keyword related to your niche. And click “Search.”\n\nThis displays thousands of keywords. Go through the keywords on the left. Click on any that could be relevant for a listicle-style post to display keywords related to your search term.\n\nFor example, if we click the keyword group named “ideas,” the Keyword Magic Tool displays keywords with the word “ideas.” Like “home decorating ideas” or “home office decor ideas.” \n\nThese keywords could work well for a blog post with curated content.\n\nThe Keyword Magic tool also shows the average monthly searches for each keyword (volume) and its keyword difficulty (KD%). These metrics help you choose a keyword where you have the best chance to rank high.\n\nGet Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nConnect with Buyers\n\nCurating content from relevant sources can help you highlight your values. And when you highlight your values, your audience is more likely to buy from you. \n\nAn estimated 44% of consumers make purchase decisions based on a brand's alignment with their values, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nSay your company values sustainability. Sharing content from authority figures who also value sustainability can cement that value to your audience.\n\nLike in this example, where plant-based beverage company Oatly shares information from Nature Food, an online journal that publishes research on food production.\n\nSo, take care to vet the sources you share. Because sharing content from sources with conflicting values may turn your audience away from your brand. And hurt your sales.\n\nHow to Curate Content\n\nThese six steps showcase the best way to curate content.\n\n1. Build Your Content Curation Strategy\n\nClearly define what you want to achieve through content curation. Goals can range from: \n\nEstablishing your brand as a thought leader\nCreating brand loyalty by highlighting your values\nIncreasing engagement by entertaining your audience, and more\n\nAnd if you already have a content strategy, review what your current strategy lacks. Then, use your curated content to fill the gap.\n\nFor example, perhaps your content consistently establishes thought leadership. But your audience appreciates more entertaining content. You can curate content to address that need.\n\n2. Define Your Audience\n\nA well-defined audience makes it easier to source the best types of content. \n\nStart by analyzing demographic information for your audience. Like their age, gender, location, income, and occupation.\n\nYou can access this information from One2Target. Just enter your domain (or your competitor’s) and click “Analyze.”\n\nThe tool will generate a report with different sections like demographics, socioeconomics, behavior, and audience overlap. In each section, you’ll find relevant information on your target audience. \n\nThen, explore your audience’s interests. Pinpoint what they like, dislike, their goals, and their biggest struggles.\n\nYou can likely access this information through customer-facing teams (like a sales team). Or by surveying your audience with a tool like Consumer Surveys.\n\nUnderstanding your audience helps you curate content that connects with people on a deep level, drives engagement, and builds brand loyalty.\n\nGet In-Depth Audience Behavior Insights\n\nwith Semrush One2Target Audience Research\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Perform Topic Research\n\nTopic research helps you identify trending topics that your audience might be gaining interest in.\n\nTo start, head to the Topic Research tool. Enter a broad topic related to your niche and click \"Get content ideas.\"\n\nThis displays different topic ideas relevant to your broad topic. With trending topics at the top.\n\nNow you can view topics that have been trending (in your niche) for the past 12 months. \n\nEven better, click \"Show more\" to reveal different web pages under \"Headlines.\" Go through these headlines to curate content ideas your audience would enjoy. \n\nWhen you find something you think your audience would enjoy, click the \"+\" to add the headline to your favorites. \n\nThis way, you can easily keep track of your curated content.\n\nFind Content Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Identify Trusted Sources\n\nIdentifying trusted sources (people and outlets you’ll curate content from) helps narrow your content search. \n\nConsider industry influencers, well-regarded websites, and authoritative publications.\n\nAnd follow pop culture and meme accounts on social media to stay updated on trends. This can help you identify relevant entertaining content.\n\nList out as many sources as possible. (Your list will come in handy in the next step.)\n\nYou might also want to list sources from which you don’t want to curate content.\n\nThis may include competitors and controversial figures. Including their content could dilute your brand. And weaken trust between you and your audience. \n\n5. Source Content\n\nSourcing content ahead of time makes it easier to pull that content together and turn it into something useful for your audience.\n\nHere are a few efficient ways to source content:\n\nSign Up for Newsletters\n\nSign up for newsletters from relevant publishers in your niche to get industry news sent straight to your inbox. \n\nIf you aren’t sure whose newsletter to subscribe to, use this handy search operator: \"your niche\" inurl:newsletter.\n\nLike this:\n\nThis displays websites with the word \"newsletter\" in their URL. Making it easier to find web pages with newsletter opt-ins.\n\nTrack Influencers on Social Media\n\nInfluencer posts can clue you into what your audience likes. And which types of content they want to see more often. \n\nSo, spend time reviewing influencer profiles on social media to see which posts perform best.\n\nTo start, head to the Social Tracker tool. Set it up using our configuration guide and add influencers to track.\n\nThen, look to the \"Top Content by Channel\" area. This shows you the best-performing content for each social profile for a given date range. \n\nIdentifying the best-performing content ensures that your audience will find it enjoyable, too.\n\nTrack Influencers’ Social Media\n\nwith the Social Tracker\n\nSign up Now →\nSet Up a Google Alert\n\nGoogle Alerts notifies you via email when someone publishes new content to the web on topics you specify.\n\nHere’s an example of an email alert for \"dog training.\"\n\nTo get ideas for Google alerts, use the Keyword Magic Tool. Enter your niche and click \"Search.\"\n\nThe tool gives you thousands of keyword ideas.\n\nGo through these and pick which terms you want alerts for. \n\nNext, set up Google Alerts with your chosen terms. Enter each term in the input box and click \"Create Alert.\"\n\nNow, Google will send frequent emails for each topic straight to your inbox.\n\nNote\n\nYou can create up to 1,000 Google Alerts. Remember that your inbox will be harder to sort through with more alerts. Start with fewer than 20. And remove or add alerts as you see fit.\n\nGet Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nCreate RSS Feeds\n\nAn RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed is a file that summarizes and organizes a website's latest content.\n\nIn other words, it compiles the newest blog posts from your favorite sites in one place. So you don't have to check each website one by one. \n\nSemrush’s Social Poster lets you create up to five RSS feeds to track authority sites in your niche.\n\nThen, when you come across something you think your audience would like, you can schedule it to social media straight from the Social Poster tool. \n\nCreate RSS Feeds\n\nwith the Social Poster Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nFind User-Generated Content\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is content created about your brand by users.\n\nUGC includes content like testimonials, product demonstrations, and lifestyle posts that feature your products or mention your brand.\n\nLike this video from makeup brand Sephora: \n\nYou can find UGC by reviewing your tagged posts on social media. And by tracking customer reviews across platforms like Facebook or Google. \n\nAlso consider a tool like Brand Monitoring to track brand mentions across the web. Once configured, this tool notifies you when you’re mentioned online. \n\nAnd Social Inbox collects comments, private messages, and mentions. To help you keep track of brand mentions for possible UGC.\n\n6. Share Your Curated Content\n\nYou’re now ready to share your curated content with your audience.\n\nHere are some ideas:\n\nContent Curation for Websites and SEO\nCreate a roundup of useful resources like websites, podcasts, newsletters, or social media accounts\nWrite a blog post that features insights from authority voices\nCompile a list of recommended tools or products relevant to your audience's interests\nTransform data into shareable infographics\n\nFor example, writer Maria Popova has a content curation blog on various topics. She includes quotes, images, links, and videos (along with her own commentary) in her posts:\n\nContent Curation for Social Media\nShare entertaining memes with your audience\nShare quotes from well-known figures\nShare user-generated content like testimonials or videos of people using your product\n\nFor example, home goods brand Caraway Home curated a list of movies. They paired each movie with their signature colors as a fun way to help their audience pick a movie to watch:\n\nContent Curation for Email:\nCreate a monthly recap summarizing key trends or events in your industry\nCreate a roundup of articles you think your audience would enjoy\nShare an expert quote with subscribers and discuss why you found it insightful\n\nFor example, marketer Ann Handley includes various events subscribers may want to attend in her newsletter:\n\nContent Curation Best Practices\n\nIt’s important to curate content that reflects your audience’s unique needs and wants. \n\nHowever, there are a few other points to keep in mind:\n\nAdd Unique Value\n\nInject your insights into the content you share to enhance its value. \n\nDoing so helps your audience understand why the content is valuable and how it relates to their lives or work.\n\nSo, how do you do this?\n\nTo start, look for ways to provide additional context to what you share. This might look like adding your own opinion on the subject. Or repackaging the information into a different format.\n\nFor example, email software Mailmodo curated an article about email marketing stats. The article included insight from other authorities in the space. \n\nTo add their own value, they compiled the data and created an infographic to make the data more digestible for their audience.\n\nGive Proper Attribution\n\nGiving attribution can keep you out of legal trouble. But it can also build rapport with others in your industry.\n\nOther businesses will appreciate you crediting their work. And your audience will trust you when they can view the original source for the content you share. \n\nTo provide attribution, clearly state the content’s source. \n\nThis includes the author's name/username and any relevant links. \n\nEmail marketing platform ConvertKit links to the creator of the example they curated for this blog post:\n\nAnd when quoting or paraphrasing, use quotation marks or block quotes. This clearly indicates that the words aren't your own. Then after the quote, include a link to the original source. \n\nLike how software company Hotjar does with this quote:\n\nGiving credit demonstrates your commitment to honesty and transparency in your content curation efforts.\n\nMeasure and Track Performance\n\nTracking the performance of your curated content helps you make data-driven decisions to improve your curation strategy.\n\nTo start, choose relevant key performance indicators (KPIs). The KPIs you choose will depend on your goals.\n\nFor example, if one of your goals is to grow your following on social media, you may want to track a metric like shares. \n\nHere are a few metrics to consider:\n\nEngagement Rate: Measure the level of interaction with your curated content, including likes, comments, and shares on social media\nClick-Through Rate (CTR): Track the percentage of users who click on the links within your curated content to gauge audience interest\nConversion Rate: Evaluate the number of users who take a desired action, such as signing up for a newsletter or making a purchase, after engaging with your curated content\nBounce Rate: Examine the percentage of users who leave your site after viewing only the curated content to determine its relevance\nTime-on-Page: Measure how much time users spend engaging with your curated content to understand its relevance\n\nRegularly monitor and analyze your KPIs to understand which content resonates with your audience. And which areas need improvement.\n\nDiversify Your Sources\n\nDiversify your sources to keep your content fresh. \n\nConsider including a mix of authoritative and smaller up-and-coming voices.\n\nYour audience will appreciate the wide range of content. And featuring more sources gives you greater opportunities for collaborations in the future.\n\nFor example, recruitment tool Wellfound shares a newsletter with curated content. They include links from authoritative sources like TechCrunch:\n\nThey also feature posts on X (formerly known as Twitter) from micro-influencers: \n\nUse a Mix of Curated and Original Content\n\nStriking a balance between original and curated content involves some experimentation. And depends on your production capabilities.\n\nStart with a 50/50 mix and adjust based on your time and budget constraints. \n\nFor example, if creating 50% original content is challenging, increase the curated content you publish. \n\nExperiment until you find the ideal ratio for your team.\n\nAnd take cues from your audience. If they react positively to your curated content (through actions like comments, likes, and shares) consider adding more curated content to the mix.\n\nUse Tools to Speed Up Your Process\n\nWe’ve mentioned a few tools to help you curate content. Here’s a refresher so you know which to use each step of the way:\n\nTopic Research to find content on specific trending topics\nSocial Tracker to identify top-performing content from influencers\nGoogle Alerts to get new content on specified topics sent to your inbox\nSocial Poster to create an RSS feed of authority sites\nBrand Monitoring to monitor brand mentions and identify UGC\nStart Curating Your Own Content\n\nA well-executed content curation strategy can expand your reach, drive traffic, and build brand awareness. \n\nPlus, you won't need to strain for content ideas each week. \n\nReady to start curating content? \n\nSign up for Semrush and get ideas for content your audience wants to see.\n\nGet Content Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
