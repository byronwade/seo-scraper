  "content": "When reputable websites link to your website, Google may view your site as more authoritative. And rank it higher in search results.\n\nHere are 10 link building strategies you can use to get quality backlinks:\n\n1. Add Value to Other Sites’ Articles\n\nIf you convince a content creator that your link will add value, they may update their existing article with a link to your site.\n\nSo, look for articles where a reference to your brand or brand asset could add value.\n\nFor example:\n\nBusiness roundups that would be more comprehensive if they mentioned your business\nBlog posts that would be more visually appealing if they included your infographic\nHow-to guides that would be more useful if they linked to your free tool\nReports that could use your statistics to back up their arguments\nResource pages that would be more complete if they linked to your blog post\n\nThen, reach out to the creator with your proposal.\n\nThe writer might update their article if they’re made aware of something worth adding. And you could receive a backlink as part of their citation.\n\nFind and pursue opportunities like these with Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nAfter setting it up, go to the “Prospects” report. Where you’ll find a list of link building prospects (sites that might link to you). \n\nIf there’s a URL for a specific page (not just the homepage), this could be a good place for your backlink.\n\nClick the icon to visit the page. And determine whether you could add value.\n\nIf so, return to your report. \n\nClick the arrow alongside the corresponding “To In Progress” button and select “Add link to article.”\n\nThe prospect will move to the “In Progress” tab.\n\nMake sure your email account is connected. Then, click the corresponding “Contact” button.\n\nNow you’re ready to craft a friendly but persuasive outreach email:\n\nSelect the email address for the most appropriate contact (or find the best email address yourself)\nWrite a short but compelling subject line\nAddress your chosen contact directly\nExplain where you’d like them to add your link and how it will add value\nMake use of the placeholders and consider saving your template for future use\n\nFor example:\n\nOnce you’ve sent your email, you can track its status in the “In Progress” tab.\n\nIf you acquire a backlink from the domain, click the check icon to move it to the “Monitor” tab.\n\nIn the “Monitor” tab, you can track the backlinks you’ve earned.\n\nSecure Valuable Backlinks\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n2. Find Broken Backlinks and Suggest Replacements\n\nBroken link building is the process of finding broken links on reputable websites and convincing the creators to replace them with working links to your website.\n\nIt’s an effective link building method because no one wants broken links on their website. And you’re providing an easy solution.\n\nBroken link building is most likely to be successful if the link was supposed to point to your site in the first place.\n\nYou can find your broken backlinks with the Backlink Audit tool:\n\nIt’s also a good idea to check out competitors’ broken backlinks with Backlink Analytics. Because you may have content to act as replacements for theirs.\n\nAfter searching a rival domain, go to the “Indexed Pages” tab and check the box next to “Broken Pages.”\n\nThe tool will reveal your competitor’s broken pages. \n\nLook out for those that you have a good replacement for. Then, you can try to acquire the backlinks that point to them.\n\nTip\n\nFocus on getting links from relevant, high-quality sites. Backlinks from poor-quality sites can do more harm than good for your SEO. You can learn more about this in our link building and toxic backlink guides. \n\nUpload your chosen prospects to the Link Building Tool. So it’s easier to manage the rest of the outreach process.\n\nIn your email, explain where the broken link is. And why your link makes a good alternative.\n\nLike this:\n\n3. Ask Publishers to Link Your Unlinked Brand Mentions\n\nUnlinked brand mentions are instances where websites refer to your brand without including a link to your site. And they might be willing to add a link if you ask.\n\nFind unlinked brand mentions with the Brand Monitoring app. \n\nConfigure the tool to search for branded terms (and any common misspellings). And it will provide a report featuring all your mentions.\n\nTo focus on unlinked mentions, expand “Mention details” > “Backlinks” and select the circle alongside “Without backlinks.”\n\nYou might also want to focus on mentions with positive sentiment. Because these sites are more likely to fulfill your link request.\n\nWhen you’re done, export your data as a CSV file. So it’s easier to upload your chosen prospects to the Link Building Tool.\n\nHere are some quick tips for drafting your outreach email: \n\nThank the publisher for your positive mention\nPolitely ask whether it’s possible for them to include a link by way of attribution\nSuggest where the link should be placed and what URL should be used\n4. Acquire and Replicate Competitors’ Backlinks\n\nWhen developing a link building strategy, it’s important to look at competitors’ backlinks. \n\nFirst, there may be backlinks you can acquire. \n\nIn other words: If you have a better version of your rival’s page, you may be able to convince the creator to link to you instead. \n\nThis link building technique can give you a competitive edge.\n\nSecond, there may be backlinks you can replicate.\n\nFor example, a publication that interviewed your rival’s CEO might be interested in interviewing your CEO, too. \n\nThis technique helps you to close any backlink gaps.\n\nSo, compare your backlinks against competitors’ with the Backlink Gap tool.\n\nEnter your domain and up to four rival domains. Then, click “Find prospects.”\n\nThe “Best” tab is displayed by default and shows domains that link to all your competitors but not to you.\n\nClick the arrow in the corresponding column to learn more about each competitor’s backlink(s). And develop a plan for acquiring or replicating them.\n\nThen, use the checkboxes and “+ Start outreach” button to send your prospects to the Link Building Tool.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Backlinks\n\nwith the Backlink Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Respond to Media Requests\n\nWhen content creators need expert input or a specific asset (e.g., a product image) for their article, they may issue a media request. \n\nResponding to these requests can be an effective link building tactic because:\n\nIt can help you get featured in high-quality publications\nResponses are often quick and easy to provide\nCreators often credit their chosen contributors with a link\n\nThis technique used to be called HARO link building, because people primarily used the HARO (Help a Reporter Out) platform to find requests. That platform is now called Connectively. \n\nIf you join Connectively as a subject matter expert, you can search for relevant requests. And sign up for email alerts.\n\nWhen you find a relevant request, try to give the creator exactly what they need. And respond as quickly as possible.\n\nThis will maximize the chance of your submission being used.\n\n6. Use Digital PR to Grab Journalists’ Attention\n\nDigital PR is the process of generating online media coverage for your brand. And it can be an effective backlink building technique. \n\nGenerally, it works like this:\n\nYou develop a story related to your brand and a current trend/news story\nYou distribute this story to relevant writers via a press release\nWriters cover your story and may credit you with a link\n\nIt’s possible to get coverage of company news—e.g., mergers and acquisitions, new hires, and product launches. But you may have more success with creative campaigns.\n\nFor example, CV Villas researched the bluest waters in the world. And the story got picked up in large publications like USA Today.\n\nDigital PR campaigns like this can generate high volumes of mentions and backlinks.\n\nFor the best chance of success, build your prospect list with a tool like Prowly.\n\nYou can find media contacts based on topics, locations, and more:\n\nSave your chosen contacts to a list.\n\nThen, you can draft and send your pitch within the tool.\n\n7. Create Link Bait\n\nLink bait is content that naturally accrues backlinks. Usually because it:\n\nActs as a useful source for writers—or a useful resource for their readers\nRanks prominently in search engines (i.e., is easily discoverable)\nDelivers value that’s hard for others to replicate \n\nImagine you’re writing about mortgages.\n\nYou might not have the resources required to create a mortgage calculator. So, you look for one you can recommend to your readers. And link to it from your page.\n\nLike this:\n\nYou might also want to include some statistics about historical mortgage rates. So, you search for relevant data. And cite the source in your article.\n\nLike this:\n\nThink about the types of content in your niche that people might want to link to.\n\nThen, try to create the very best version of it. And optimize it for search.\n\nYou can also improve your content’s discoverability by:\n\nPosting it on social media\nSharing it in relevant communities (as long as it’s genuinely helpful)\nLinking to it from your email newsletter\n\nTip\n\nTo get inspiration for your link bait, look at your competitors’ most-linked pages. Simply search their domain in Backlink Analytics then go to the “Indexed Pages” report.\n \n\n8. Collaborate with Your Partners\n\nIf you have any partnerships with businesses, organizations, or influencers, see if you can get backlinks out of them.\n\nFor example, vendors/suppliers might want to:\n\nAnnounce your partnership on their blog\nList you on their “clients” page\nPublish a testimonial you’ve provided\nCreate a case study about your business\n\nAnd this gives you the opportunity to get backlinks like the one below:\n\nYou can also run collaborative marketing campaigns to multiply your link building efforts.\n\nFor example, Levi’s collaborated with McLaren to create a clothing range. Both brands have promoted the partnership and likely earned each other links in the process.\n\n9. Recover Lost Backlinks\n\nIf one of your backlinks is removed, consider trying to get it back. Because if a domain linked to you in the first place, they’re probably willing to do it again.\n\nAfter all, the creator might have deleted your link accidentally. Or maybe their content needs have changed, but they’d be willing to include a link to something else on your website.\n\nFind and monitor your lost backlinks with the Backlink Audit tool.\n\nAfter setting up your project, go to the “Lost & Found” report.\n\nClick the blue number next to “Referring Domains” > “Lost.”\n\nThen, click “Advanced filters,” select the “Authority Score” drop-down and set a custom range from 50 to 100. (This means links from those domains are likely to be the most beneficial.)\n\nLike this:\n\nYou’ll see authoritative domains that you’ve lost all backlinks from in the specified time range—i.e., domains you no longer have any active backlinks on.\n\nVisit any source URL to try to work out what happened to your backlink.\n\nIf you want to compare against the old version of the page, you might be able to find it on the Wayback Machine.\n\nThink there’s a chance of getting your backlink back (on the original page or elsewhere on the site)?\n\nSend a friendly email to the page or website owner.\n\n10. Build Your Brand\n\nOne of the best ways to acquire links is to build brand awareness. And a strong brand identity.\n\nBecause it increases the chance that content creators think of and choose your brand when adding links.\n\nFor example, WebMD is a well-known and well-regarded health site. So, when creators need to source health information, they’re likely to link to WebMD.\n\nHere are some ways to build a brand that people link to:\n\nSEO: Get unpaid exposure in search engine results pages\nSocial media management: Expand your reach and build connections through social platforms\nDigital advertising: Pay to promote your brand in relevant locations\nInfluencer marketing: Incentivize influencers to promote your brand to their audiences\nGuest blogging: Write authoritative blog posts for relevant sites in your niche\nContent marketing: Create and distribute content that boosts your visibility and topical authority\n\nThere’s also a flywheel effect in link building:\n\nThe more links you acquire, the more your authority and visibility increase. Making it easier to build links in the future.\n\nSet the flywheel in motion with Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nSecure Valuable Backlinks\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nSign Up Now →",
