  "content": "What Is SEO Content?\n\nSEO content is website content (like blog posts, product pages, and images) that’s optimized to appear prominently in search engines like Google. So it can generate high-quality, unpaid traffic.\n\nIn other words, it’s online content that’s:\n\nCentered around topics target audiences search for\nCreated with search engine ranking factors in mind\n\nFor example, pet furniture company Hepper creates SEO-driven content like this:\n\nAnd that page gained Google rankings for associated keywords like this:\n\nSEO content helped Hepper grow organic traffic by roughly 600 times over two years. And increase product sales revenue by 2,964%.\n\nYour company could do something similar.\n\nNote\n\nSEO typically stands for search engine optimization. But you’ll likely hear people refer to “SEO-optimized content” or “search engine-optimized content.”\n\nHow to Create SEO Content\n\nLearn how to create SEO content step by step: \n\n1. Conduct Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research is the process of finding what people search for in search engines.\n\nIt allows you to identify SEO content ideas that are:\n\nRelevant to your brand \nPopular among searchers\nFeasible to rank highly for\n\nAnd that means the resulting content is able to generate valuable traffic.\n\nTo get started, enter a topic relevant to your brand into Semrush’s Topic Research tool.\n\nThen, choose your target country and click “Get content ideas.”\n\nThe tool will collect content ideas related to your topic.\n\nClick “Show more” on any idea to see:\n\nSubtopic Volume: The average number of monthly searches for the subtopic keyword. The higher the number, the higher your SEO content’s potential reach.\nDifficulty: A measure of ranking difficulty expressed as a percentage. The higher the score, the harder it’ll be to earn a prominent ranking that gets lots of clicks.\nTopic Efficiency: A measure of subtopic volume relative to difficulty. The higher the rating, the better the ranking opportunity.\nHeadlines: The titles of the most linked-to pages on this topic. You can click the arrow icon to visit each page and see what the content is like.\nQuestions: The most-searched questions related to the topic. Answering frequently asked questions can be a good way to attract and engage target audiences.\nRelated searches: Related searches that appear on Google’s search results page. These might spark other SEO content ideas.\n\nHere’s a quick intro to some other keyword research methods: \n\nSearch a keyword database. Use the Keyword Magic Tool to search our database of over 25 billion keywords. You can filter for question keywords, low-difficulty keywords, etc.\nCheck for keyword gaps. Use the Keyword Gap tool to identify instances when competitors rank higher than you. Or appear for keywords that you don’t.\n\nOnce you’ve found a keyword you’re interested in, analyze the search engine results page (SERP). We’ll explain how in the next section.\n\nGet SEO Content Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n2. Analyze the SERP\n\nAnalyze the SERP for your chosen keyword to see what type of content performs well.\n\nThat way, you can:\n\nGet a better understanding of search intent (what the user wants to achieve)\nConfirm whether the keyword opportunity aligns with your goals\nReview competitors’ content and get inspiration for your own SEO content\n\nTo analyze a SERP, don’t just enter your keyword into Google. Your search results are personalized, so they may not reflect what your target audience sees.\n\nInstead, enter your target keyword and location into Keyword Overview.\n\nThen, scroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section. \n\nYou’ll see:\n\nURLs that appear on Google’s first page—which you can visit by clicking the icons alongside them\nAny SERP features (non-standard search results) that show—which you can see for yourself by clicking the “View SERP” link\n\nUse this information to determine what users want to find. Which is what Google wants to rank.\n\nFor example, the “how to cut dog nails” SERP indicates that users want:\n\nInformation on how to safely trim their dog’s nails at home\nAdvice from an expert (e.g., American Kennel Club) or fellow dog owners (e.g., on Reddit)\nInstructions via video or text and images\n\nIf creating this content makes sense for your brand, proceed to the next step.\n\nIf not, find a keyword that’s a better match.\n\n3. Create Quality Content\n\nGoogle wants to rank quality content that offers substantial and unique value to users.\n\nSo, you need to decide how to satisfy search intent. And do it better than your competitors.\n\nThere are many ways to give your SEO content an edge:\n\nConduct original research, so you have unique insights to share\nProvide additional resources, such as images, videos, or templates\nShare personal opinions, stories, and ideas that aren’t available elsewhere\nPresent information in a more effective and user-friendly way\nCover the topic more comprehensively\n\nQuality content also demonstrates Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). \n\nParticularly when it comes to Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) topics that can affect users’ well-being.\n\nFor example, let’s look at the American Kennel Club’s guide to cutting dog nails. Which attracts 12.9K organic visits per month in the U.S., according to Semrush’s Organic Research tool.\n\nThe page includes reliable information from qualified vets.\n\nAnd provides it in written, image, and video formats. To cater to users’ various needs and preferences.\n\nThe guide also covers relevant subtopics, such as how to grind a dog’s nails.\n\nAnd presents information in a user-friendly way.\n\n4. Use Keywords Strategically\n\nUsing keywords in your content helps Google understand that your content is relevant to those queries. So, it’s a must when you’re creating content for SEO.\n\nBut you must tread carefully. Because Google penalizes sites that engage in keyword spam—i.e., use keywords in a way that’s unnatural and unhelpful to users.\n\nBelow, we’ll explain how to use keywords to optimize written content, images, and videos.\n\nWritten Content\n\nWhen you’re writing content for SEO, it’s best practice to include your primary keyword in these locations:\n\nTitle tag: The page title that can appear in the SERP\nMeta description: The page summary that can appear in the SERP\nH1 tag: The main heading that appears on the page\nURL slug: The unique part of the webpage address\nThe first paragraph of body content (and throughout the written content, where natural)\n\nAnd include secondary keywords (other search terms people use to find content like yours). They tend to work well within paragraphs and subheadings.\n\nFor example, the American Kennel Club uses keywords like “how to trim your dog’s nails,” “dog nail trimming,” etc.\n\nYou can get help optimizing your content with Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nStart a new document and fill out the details in the “Set a new goal” section. Then, click “Get recommendations.”\n\nThe tool will analyze top-ranking competitors to provide a variety of recommendations.\n\nStart writing your text with these recommendations in mind.\n\nAs you write, the tool will highlight any issues. And score your SEO text on four criteria:\n\nReadability\nSEO\nOriginality\nTone of voice\n\nIf you need help improving your score, use the AI-powered Smart Writer tools.\n\nOptimize for Keywords\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign Up Now →\nImage Content\n\nTo optimize an image for SEO, first give it a descriptive file name.\n\nThen, write descriptive alt text when you upload the image to your site. (This is the image description used for accessibility and SEO purposes.)\n\nYou may also be able to write a descriptive title and description. Like so:\n\nYou can then add the image to your webpages as desired.\n\nVideo Content\n\nTo optimize a video for SEO, it’s generally best to upload the video to YouTube (because Google owns the platform). And incorporate your target keyword into the title and description.\n\nLike this:\n\nYou can then embed your optimized videos into your webpages.\n\nThis can make it easier for users to find them. And for Google to understand their purpose.\n\n5. Apply Schema Markup\n\nSchema markup (or structured data) is code that helps Google identify different aspects of your SEO website content.\n\nIt can improve Google’s understanding of your content. And make you eligible for rich results (search results with extra, attention-grabbing features).\n\nFor example, the schema behind Inspired Taste’s carrot cake recipe looks like this:\n\nAnd the recipe appears on some SERPs like this:\n\nYou may be able to find a website plugin that makes it easy to implement schema markup.\n\nOtherwise, check out the advice in Google’s help guide. Or seek help from a web developer.\n\nStart Creating SEO Content\n\nSemrush has all the tools you need to find SEO content ideas—and bring them to life effectively.\n\nSign up for free to try tools like:\n\nTopic Research, which makes it easy to find popular keywords you can rank highly for\nSEO Writing Assistant, the ultimate companion for writing search-optimized content\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
