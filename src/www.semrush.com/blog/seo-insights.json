  "content": "SEO insights tell you how your website and its content perform in search engine results. They help you fine tune your content strategy, so your website can rank higher and offer a better user experience.\n\nIn this article, we’ll share practical SEO insights and free tools to improve your content strategy and increase organic traffic in 2023 and beyond.\n\n7 Best SEO Insights to Improve Your Content Strategy in 2023\n\nSearch engine algorithms and user behaviors keep changing.\n\nWhich means search marketers need to keep up. \n\nOur State of Search report found that even though Google released fewer updates in 2022, fluctuations in keyword rankings were higher compared to 2021.\n\nThis could be because Google has become more effective at fighting spam and removing irrelevant domains from its index.\n\nThere’s also the possibility that people have abandoned domains they created at the start of the pandemic, while authoritative brands have improved their rankings for more keywords with fewer pages.\n\nIt’s clear: what worked last year might not cut it anymore. And staying abreast of these algorithm updates and ever-evolving SERPs is a must if you want to bring in more organic traffic.\n\nLet’s dive straight into seven SEO insights you need to know:\n\n1. Satisfying Search Intent Is More Important Than Ever\n\nSearch intent (or user intent) is the reason why a user types a query into a search engine. To show up in the search results, your content needs to match people’s search intent. \n\nFor example, if someone wants to buy a website address and searches for “buy domain name,” your content should help them find and buy domain names.\n\nA blog post explaining what a domain name is would be too high-level. Because it doesn’t align with what people actually look for when they use those keywords.\n\nThere are four types of search intent:\n\nNavigational: Searchers finding a specific website\nInformational: Searchers looking for information\nCommercial: Searchers doing research before making a purchase\nTransactional: Searchers wanting to make a purchase.\n\nMatching search intent matters because Google’s all about giving people what they want. Its general guidelines (PDF), published in December 2022, have a whole section dedicated to understanding search users, queries, and results.\n\nWhen your content perfectly aligns with what users search for, it’s a win-win:\n\nHigher ranking: Google’s algorithm recognizes when your content is a perfect match for what a user searches for. This increases your chances of ranking higher in the search results.\nBetter user experience: When a user finds your content matches their intent, it improves brand trust and means they’re more likely to visit your site again when they need an answer to a similar question\n\nFor example, let’s say you want to rank for “global payroll providers.” Type the keyword into Google and you’ll see the top-ranking results are curated lists of global payroll providers.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWhen people search for “global payroll providers,” they want to see options or recommendations.\n\nThis is one of the reasons People Managing People’s article listing the “26 Best Global Payroll Service Providers of 2023” ranks highly for this keyword. It aligns with search intent and helps people make an informed decision.\n\nFor the same reason, Papaya Global’s article, “Global Payroll: Challenges & Solutions” doesn’t appear in the first few pages. It talks about the challenges and solutions of global payroll and fails to meet the search intent.\n\nSo, how do you determine search intent?\n\nOpen Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool.\n\nEnter your keyword, click “Search,” and you’ll see a box named “Intent.”\n\nHere, we see the intent for “chatbots for customer service.”\n\nNotice how it labels the intent as “Informational.” This tells us people want information on a specific topic or issue. They want to learn more. So high-ranking content likely answers tons of questions.\n\nSpeaking of:\n\nScroll down, and you’ll see Keyword ideas and a list of Questions:\n\nThese are searches and questions related to the main keyword. You can use this information as a jumping-off point for your research and outline.\n\n2. Analyze SERP Features to Boost Your SEO Game\n\nSERP features are the additional elements you see on a search engine results page apart from the organic search results. They provide more information or options, which improves the search experience.\n\nSome common SERP features include:\n\nFeatured snippet\nLocal pack\nReviews\nSitelinks\nVideos\nImages\nTop stories\nKnowledge panel\nPeople Also Ask (or More to Ask)\nRelated searches\nGoogle Ads\nRich snippets\n\nFor example, this is what the SERP looks like for “how to track employee training.” You can see the featured snippet:\n\nThe “More to ask” (or “People also ask”) section:\n\nPaid ads:\n\nAnd related searches:\n\nAccording to our zero-click study, 25% of desktop searches and 17.3% of mobile searches end without a click.\n\nSERP features help Google deliver information to people quickly and easily.\n\nHere’s how to improve your content’s chances of getting featured:\n\nAnalyze SERP features\n\nThis helps you understand what catches people’s attention and compels them to click.\n\nFor instance, look at the “More to Ask” section to find relevant questions related to your topic.\n\nThen, use the insights to create content that directly addresses those questions. This way, your content is more likely to appear in that section—and get clicked.\n\nTake a look at the example below. “How much does it cost to build a whole website” is one of the questions that appears in the “More to Ask” section for the keyword “how to build a website.”\n\nPeople may click on that MonsterInsights article because the answer positions the website as an authority on the topic.\n\nAvoid zero-click searches\n\nFind keywords that don’t have instant answers at the top of the SERP. These have higher click potential because they don’t appear as a SERP feature.\n\nTake the keyword, “payment protection insurance,” for example. It doesn’t have a featured snippet (or instant answer). All people see is a list of organic search results.\n\nHere lies your opportunity.\n\nYou can create informative content around this keyword and aim to rank high in the organic search results.\n\nFurther reading: Avoiding Zero-click Searches to Get More Traffic\n\n3. Get a Competitive Edge with Long-Tail Keywords\n\nLong-tail keywords are search queries that are highly specific with relatively low search volume.\n\nPeople who use specific search queries have a clearer idea of what they want and are likely closer to taking action (eg. making a purchase, filling out a form, etc.). This brings in higher quality traffic from more qualified leads, leading to more conversions.\n\nFor example, if you target a short-tail keyword like “project management tool,” you’ll likely attract a broad audience. People early in the research phase are less likely to convert.\n\nIf you target a long-tail keyword like “project management tools in software engineering,” you’ll likely to attract people who have moved beyond the initial research phase.\n\nLong-tail keywords are also generally easy to rank for because there’s less competition.\n\nYou can discover long-tail keywords in the “Related searches” section of the SERP. For example, here are specific queries related to “internal communications plan.”\n\nIn Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool, we see “internal communications plan” has a 46% Keyword Difficulty:\n\nThe long-tail query “internal communications plan examples pdf” is much lower at 13%:\n\nSo, long-tail keywords are generally easier to rank for.\n\n4. Create Content for Humans, Not Machines\n\nGoogle prioritizes content that people find genuinely helpful.\n\nHelpful, people-first content addresses your target audience’s needs, answers their questions, and helps them find the information or solutions they need.\n\nWhen your content is helpful, it builds trust. People might return to your site for more information or take an action, such as signing up for newsletters, making purchases, or contacting your business.\n\nHere are some practical tips to create quality content that stands out:\n\nGet to know your audience: Understand your audience’s pain points and motivations to create content that resonates with them\nShowcase expertise: Involve subject-matter experts and create original, expert-driven content to boost credibility\nFind the right formats: Use the right formats for your content so that it’s engaging and effective (eg. blog posts, podcasts, videos, etc.)\nEnsure content readability: Write short and simple sentences, use images to break up long sections, and share relevant information first to make content easy to read and digest\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s Topic Research tool to find relevant topic ideas for your audience. It also suggests subtopics, questions, and related searches to inspire your content.\n\nThis blog post on driving empathy in design with user feedback by Hotjar is a good example of quality content. It addresses a crucial topic in design—empathy-driven design, which is highly relevant today.\n\nIt’s written in a conversational tone, making it approachable and easy to understand. It also includes diagrams and screenshots to help you grasp the key points.\n\nTo make the user experience even better, Hotjar added a reading progress bar and an “On this page” floating widget. These features help you easily navigate and engage with the content.\n\n5. Show, Don’t Tell: Why You Need to Demonstrate Firsthand Experience\n\nGoogle’s E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) guidelines stress the importance of content created by authors who have hands-on experience with the subject matter.\n\nAnother important factor is expertise, such as a qualification in a certain field. For example, someone who’s a certified financial advisor writing a personal finance blog.\n\nAuthors with firsthand experience and expertise tend to provide accurate and trustworthy information packed with personal insights.\n\nThe bottom line: Google wants to ensure that the person who wrote the content is a reliable source.\n\nHere are some ways to show firsthand experience while creating content:\n\nAuthor bios: Include author bios or create dedicated pages showing their qualifications and past wor\nCredible sources: Link to reputable sources such as studies, research papers, etc.\nGuest authors: Collaborate with guest authors who have experience in the topic\nReal-life examples: Share real-life stories and case studies that reflect your experience\nBehind-the-scenes: Describe how you created a piece of content for added transparency\nExpert review of content: Build authority and show expertise with expert analysis. For example, a doctor reviewing medical content\n\nIntercom is a good example. It largely features blog posts written by experts who draw from their own experiences to provide practical advice and insights to readers.\n\nFor instance, you can find articles authored by Intercom’s VP of customer support. His firsthand experience in customer support adds credibility to the content. Intercom also includes a clear author bio, establishing his credentials and expertise in the field.\n\n6. Optimized Images Give You More SEO Impact\n\nWhen you optimize your images for search, you improve your chances of ranking higher on Google Images. This means more eyes on your visuals, more website visits, and a better chance of people discovering your content (or products).\n\nBut here’s the kicker: Visuals don’t only appear on the Images page. They show up on the main search results page, too.\n\nThis way they grab attention right where people search for information. Which gives your content an even better chance to get noticed.\n\nFor example, these are the images that appear on the main SERP for “ecommerce conversion funnel.”\n\nImage optimization doesn’t just boost your website’s visibility in search results. It also makes your images more accessible, your site load faster, and your content more engaging. Here’s how to improve your image SEO:\n\nDescriptive alt texts: Write specific descriptions for images (eg. “internal-communication-tools” instead of something generic like “IMG123”)\nImage compression: Reduce image size to increase page speed\nImage formats: Choose suitable image formats (eg. JPEG, PNG, SVG, or WebP)\nSitemap: Create an image sitemap to increase your chances of appearing in the Image results\nStructured data: Use structured data to help search engines better understand your website’s content\n\nFurther reading: Read our Image SEO guide to learn how it can get more traffic to your site.\n\n7. One High-Quality Backlink Beats Many Irrelevant Ones\n\nBacklinks are links on one website that point to another website. They’re one of Google’s most important ranking factors.\n\nAccording to our 13-month study, nearly all (92.3%) of the domains that rank in the top 100 have at least one backlink.\n\nBut link building is not about collecting a bunch of backlinks anymore. It’s about having natural, high-quality ones from reputable websites.\n\nWhen these websites link to your content, it shows that others trust and value what you have to offer. It’s like a vote of confidence in your website.\n\nPlus, search engines value them because they see high-quality backlinks as a sign that your content is a reliable source of information.\n\nAll this can lead to higher search engine rankings, more visibility, and more organic traffic.\n\nFor example, Layoffs.fyi, a company that tracks layoffs in tech startups, has received external links from authoritative websites like TechCrunch and BBC—all thanks to their original and valuable content.\n\nHere are some tactics to build natural, high-quality backlinks:\n\nGreat content: Create original, engaging content that naturally attracts links\nGuest posts: Contribute a guest post for a relevant website in your niche\nHARO: Use HARO (Help a Reporter Out) and respond to journalists’ queries to secure potential backlinks\nPublish original research: Create research reports and pitch them to the media\nCompetitor backlink analysis: Analyze your competitors’ backlinks to identify new opportunities for outreach\n\nSemrush’s Link Building tool makes it easier to build high-quality links at scale. It helps you discover new backlink opportunities, connect with relevant websites, and keep track of your backlink profile, simplifying the entire link-building process.\n\n6 Free SEO Insights Tools to Optimize Your Content\n\nTo turn these SEO insights into action, you need the right tools.
