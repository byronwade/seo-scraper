  "content": "Streamlined ecommerce navigation is essential for a profitable online shop.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause users will be more likely to convert if they can find the products and information they need.\n\nBut if your navigation is cluttered and clunky, users may leave. Or head to your competitor’s site.\n\nToday, we’re diving into ecommerce navigation examples and best practices to help you design your shop’s menu with ease.\n\nThe Importance of User-Friendly Ecommerce Navigation\n\nThere are four key benefits to user-friendly navigation:\n\n1. Better User Experience (UX)\n\nStreamlined navigation improves the overall experience of your site.\n\nPeople have specific goals when they visit your site. Such as learning more about your company or buying a product. Well-structured navigation helps people achieve whichever goals they have.\n\nBut if people can’t complete their goal, they’ll likely bounce (leave without visiting other pages or completing some other action on your site). And that negative experience can cost you. \n\nIn fact, 61% of consumers will shop with a competitor after only one bad experience, according to Zendesk.\n\nImproving your site’s navigation will keep users clicking happily through your site.\n\n2. Higher Conversion Rates\n\nEvery shopper needs different information before they make a purchase. Some may want to read your return policy. Others might want to find specific products. \n\nGreat navigation reduces friction and guides shoppers toward their purchase. A clear navigation system ensures that visitors can access the information they need to convert. \n\nBut it’s not just conversion rates that increase when people can find what they need; cart totals also rise. \n\nThe numbers are clear: 89% of shoppers say they’ll spend more money on their ecommerce purchases if they find what they need without contacting anyone, according to Zendesk.\n\nTo improve your ecommerce navigation, stay on top of site errors. Errors like broken pages or links make it harder for people to reach their destination and to find what they’re searching for. \n\nTo spot errors, use Semrush’s Site Audit tool. To start, enter your website domain and click “Start Audit.\"\n\nThen, configure the Site Audit settings. Our configuration guide walks you through the process if you get stuck. \n\nNext, Semrush will audit your site, which can take up to a day for the full report.\n\nWhen Site Audit completes your audit, scroll down to the “Crawled Pages” section (in the “Overview” tab). Click the number beside “Broken.” \n\nThis shows you pages on your site with errors. Along with the error’s HTTP status code (a three-digit number, like 404, that tells you the issue with the page).\n\nGo through and fix these pages so they no longer return an error. For example, you will want to fix redirect pages with 404 errors to a similar page. Then, your site will redirect users who click the original link to the new page.\n\nNext, click the “Issues” tab and scroll until you see “# internal links are broken.”\n\nClick on the report to view your broken links (links that point to a page that doesn’t exist or can’t be found).\n\nFix these by adding a working link, deleting the link or fixing the broken page where it links.\n\nReviewing broken links and pages with errors ensures smooth site navigation for users.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Improved Search Engine Optimization\n\nWhen your website is easy to navigate, search engine bots can crawl your site (discovering pages) and then include those pages in the search results. This can help your site get more traffic from search engines.\n\nBut first, you must make sure there aren’t issues preventing search engines from crawling your site. Otherwise, search engines may not place your site in the search results.\n\nYou can check for crawlability issues with Site Audit.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nFirst, follow the steps outlined in the section above. Then, click into your Site Audit project and then head into the “Overview” tab. Look for “Crawlability” and click “View details.”\n\nPay attention to the “Crawl Budget Waste” report.\n\nThis report highlights which pages affect a search engine bot’s ability to crawl your site. Ideally, you want your crawl budget waste errors to be as low as possible.\n\nGo through the list and fix the errors. You can click the orange bar to drill into each issue. And get a list of the affected pages.\n\nFixing these errors helps bots crawl and index your site more efficiently. Ultimately, you will have a better shot at ranking higher and getting more clicks from the search results. \n\n4. Increased Accessibility\n\nClear site navigation lets everyone, regardless of abilities, use your site and shop your products. \n\nFor example:\n\nClearly labeled links make it easier for those who use screen readers to understand the structure of your site\nSimple navigation helps those with cognitive differences find pages with ease\nClean navigation lets people with mobility issues use the “tab” button to access specific links\n\nAnd some countries legally require you to provide an accessible experience on your site. \n\nNote\n\nWe recommend speaking with an accessibility specialist in your area. They can tell you what’s needed to ensure your site complies with accessibility laws where you operate.\n\n13 Examples of the Best Ecommerce Navigation\n\nLet’s look at some ecommerce navigation examples to inspire your shop’s design.\n\nDrop-Down Menu Navigation\n\nYou’ll find drop-down menus at the top of a website. Hovering over a link expands the menu to reveal additional links.\n\nBook retailer Indigo has several high-level categories for their drop-down menu (below).\n\nEach category expands into more subcategories when users hover over the link. For example, if you hover over “Gifts,” a submenu appears. This menu shows links for gifts by season, price, and different personas. \n\nAnd Office Depot indicates the menu will “drop down” with arrows. \n\nThese arrows help users understand what happens if they hover their mouse over certain words. They can be useful if some of your navigation elements expand into a dropdown, and some don’t. \n\nThis way, users will know which links open a drop-down menu and which ones don’t. Otherwise, they might get confused and think your menu is broken if certain elements reveal a drop-down and others don’t.\n\nHorizontal Navigation \n\nHorizontal navigations are links arranged horizontally near the top of a website. Unlike drop-down navigation, nothing appears if a user hovers over a link. \n\nHorizontal navigation can work for smaller ecommerce sites with few pages to list. \n\nHere’s a simple horizontal menu from eyewear company Warby Parker.\n\nTheir two-tiered navigation guides people to important pages, like shopping carts, different product categories, and sunglasses and accessories. \n\nAnd subscription box company Birchbox uses a single-layer navigation to list category pages.\n\nSidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation is ideal if you have numerous pages to include in your navigation.\n\nBecause sidebar navigations are compact, they often have more room for top-level links than a horizontal or drop-down menu.\n\nRetail chain Kohl’s sells thousands of products. And they need to maximize their navigation menu to help people find the right product. So, they’ve opted for a sidebar menu.\n\nTheir sidebar menu lets them fit a handful of product categories that open up into a larger menu. \n\nThey use the hamburger icon with text that reads “Shop by Category.” This way, users know where to click to find the menu.\n\nPetco also sells thousands of products. They use a scrollable sidebar menu to list out different product categories that users might find useful.\n\nWhile they don’t use any text to identify the menu, they use a hamburger icon.\n\nMost users are familiar with this icon. And know to click it to access a menu.\n\nFooter Menu Navigation\n\nYour footer navigation should include helpful links that aren’t directly related to your primary products but can aid visitors in navigating your site and finding additional information. \n\nIt’s helpful for links to your social media accounts. Or your FAQ page.\n\nThese links often enhance the user experience, provide essential details, and establish credibility. \n\nClothing retailer Nordstrom has six columns of links to help users find contacts, learn about the company, and access account information. \n\nTheir footer menu uses headings to group different links so users can find what they need.\n\nBreadcrumb Navigation\n\nBreadcrumb navigation is a secondary navigation system that shows users how they landed on a specific page. \n\nFor example, clothing company H&M lists breadcrumb navigation at the top of each product. \n\nIf users want to see more products, they can use the breadcrumb navigation to go back to previous pages or categories without starting over. It makes moving around the site easy and smooth.\n\nRetailer Target also uses breadcrumb navigation. They tack a product number onto the final page. \n\nThis could help the user determine if they want to continue refining their search. Or browse through the number of products listed.\n\nFaceted Navigation\n\nFaceted navigation is a filtering system people use to tailor product pages.\n\nClothing retailer J.Crew adds a faceted navigation to the side of product category pages. Users can define things like fabric type and silhouette to filter products. \n\nAnd shoe company Aldo also uses a faceted navigation that users can click to reveal:\n\nShoppers can then sort through filters like category, size, color, price, and features. To find the products they want.\n\nIf you want a faceted menu but aren’t sure which criteria to use, start by viewing the faceted menus of your competition. Note which criteria they use. \n\nThen, speak with customers to see if there are other criteria you should add (or remove) to make their searches earlier. \n\nSearch Navigation\n\nSearch navigation combines search functionality with browsing ability. These features help get users closer to the exact page they want.\n\nLet’s look at this search navigation example from retailer Wayfair. Wayfair’s predictive search helps users find specific products when they start typing.\n\nThe suggested terms can help users narrow their search.\n\nAnd shoe retailer Browns adds images to their search menu. \n\nSearch navigation with images can simplify the user’s journey. And improve the overall search experience. \n\nEcommerce Navigation Best Practices\n\nAfter seeing all the different examples, you’re nearly ready to design (or revamp) your navigation. Here are some best practices to keep in mind.\n\nCreate a Logical Structure\n\nA logical website structure (the way you organize and connect your webpages) lets users browse your site without hitting roadblocks.\n\nAnd you can create a logical structure by identifying how people currently use your site.\n\nTo do this, use an analytics tool like Google Analytics (GA4). \n\nGA4’s Path exploration report shows you the path users take to end up on certain pages. \n\nThis user flow diagram identifies common paths on your site. \n\nGiven that these are the paths users are already taking, consider using this report to outline your navigation.\n\nTip\n\nSort the traffic by different devices to see how people navigate your site depending on their device. Then, create tailored menus for different devices.\n\nInclude Prominent Access to Key Pages\n\nMake sure key pages are easy to access by giving them prime real estate in your navigation menu. Like adding them to your top-level navigation (the first layer of navigation).\n\nYou can identify important pages by reviewing your analytics. Your key pages are likely the pages that receive the most traffic. \n\nOther important pages you might want to highlight in your navigation include:\n\nA cart or checkout page\nAn account login page \nInformation on shipping, returns, or product deals\nKeep Navigation Consistent\n\nMaintain consistency in elements like placement and design. Consistent navigation makes it easy for people to explore your site, no matter which page they’re on. \n\nFor example, the drop-down menu for ice cream company Ben & Jerry’s remains consistent across all pages. \n\nUsers don’t need to sort through different menus depending on which page they land on. If they did, they might feel confused and leave the site.\n\nEnsure Users Don’t Hit Roadblocks\n\nYou want to make sure users can navigate your site without running into broken pages or errors.\n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to automatically check your site for errors.\n\nSemrush sends weekly or daily reports based on your configuration. That way, you’ll know if something breaks (and can fix it right away).\n\nUse Multiple Types of Navigations\n\nYou can also use multiple navigation types to help people find what they need. \n\nFor example, jewelry company Tiffany & Co combines a horizontal navigation with a drop-down navigation. \n\nThe horizontal navigation includes important links that don’t require additional context (like a drop-down menu might).\n\nRegardless of how you combine your navigation, you should aim to have at minimum:\n\nA main navigation at the top\nNavigation in your footer\nBreadcrumb navigation for product pages\n\nThese navigation types tend to be standard. And users expect them across the sites they visit.\n\nMake Navigation Mobile-Friendly\n\nYou don’t need to worry about losing sales when your menu looks great on all types of devices.\n\nYouGov reports that 45% of consumers use their phones to shop every day. Tailoring your mobile menu helps you keep mobile users on your site.\n\nTo achieve mobile-friendly navigation, logically organize your menu items. They should also be easy to tap and read on a small screen. \n\nHere’s how Kohl’s desktop menu looks compared to the mobile one:\n\nBoth menus contain the same items. But the mobile one is scrollable. And the text is large and easy to click.\n\nAnd Nordstrom takes the content from their footer menu and adds it to their scrollable mobile menu:\n\nBoth approaches ensure mobile devices can access the same pages as desktop users without any extra fuss.\n\nReady to Improve Your Site’s Navigation?\n\nImproving your ecommerce’s navigation can result in higher sales, happier users, and better SEO.\n\nSemrush tools let you spot errors affecting your navigation.
