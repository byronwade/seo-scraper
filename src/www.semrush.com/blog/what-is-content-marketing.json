  "content": "What Is Content Marketing?\n\nContent marketing is the process of planning, creating, and sharing valuable content to attract and engage a specific audience. To build relationships that eventually contribute to business results.\n\nIt focuses on solving problems and answering questions. Not necessarily directly selling products or services. \n\nCommon types of content include:\n\nBlog posts\nVideos\nPodcast episodes\nInfographics\nEbooks\nNewsletters\nSocial media posts\nWebinars\n\nThe goal? \n\nTo build trust with your audience and establish your expertise. So that when your audience needs a solution you offer, they'll be more likely to turn to you first.\n\nFor example, look at how Dove uses content marketing:\n\nTheir blog contains articles on body positivism and self-esteem. Their inspirational YouTube videos challenge beauty stereotypes. And their Instagram showcases real, unedited photos of women of all shapes and sizes. \n\nEach content type serves a specific purpose. But together, they create a platform of empowerment and self-acceptance. \n\nThis approach helps Dove build a loyal community and positions their brand as more than just a soap. \n\nWhich means:\n\nWhen someone shops for personal care products, they’re more likely to choose Dove.\n\nKey benefits of content marketing include:\n\nHigher search engine rankings: Publishing and updating website content that’s created with search engines in mind can help you appear prominently in search results\nIncreased organic traffic: Having your content appear prominently in search results often leads to more website visits\nEnhanced customer loyalty: Providing content that your audience finds valuable can foster trust and loyalty\nIncreased conversion rates: engaging content can convert visitors into loyal customers\n\nFurther reading: Content Marketing Statistics You Need to Know\n\nHow Does Content Marketing Work?\n\nContent marketing works by reaching the right audience at the right time. Which is largely about targeting each stage of the marketing funnel—from awareness to decision. \n\nNote\n\nMany funnel models also include a fourth phase—loyalty—because you ideally want to retain customers in the long term. But you need to start with these three before getting to that point.\n\nAwareness \n\nAt this stage, content marketing is all about creating awareness for your brand and your products or services. \n\nYour potential customers are just realizing they have a problem. And your goal is to grab their attention.\n\nYou should create content that provides high-level education and has broad appeal. To attract as many relevant people as possible. \n\nEffective content types for this stage can include:\n\nBlog posts\nInfographics\nEbooks\nSocial media posts\n\nExample: The Squarespace blog helps businesses and entrepreneurs learn how to build their own websites.\n\nAnd their blog brings in around 14.9K monthly visitors from organic search alone. \n\nImage Data Source: Organic Research\n\nConsideration \n\nIn the consideration stage, you can nurture leads and urge them to consider your business. Because your audience is actively researching solutions. \n\nYour best bet is to create in-depth content that’s persuasive and explains what makes you stand out from the competition. \n\nEffective content types at this stage:\n\nHow-to guides\nComparison articles\nWebinars\n\nExample: Podia’s “alternatives” webpage with in-depth information about how their product compares to their closest competitors. \n\nDecision \n\nIn this third and final stage, leads are ready to buy. So, provide leads with content that solidifies your value to give them the final push toward taking action. \n\nYou want to create content that instills a sense of urgency, addresses any objections, and makes it easy to take the next step. \n\nEffective content types:\n\nSuccess stories\nProduct demos\nCustomer testimonials\n\nExample: Gong’s YouTube channel highlights how real teams and businesses have benefited from using their tool.\n\nHow to Get Started with Content Marketing \n\nWhat does content marketing actually involve?\n\nLet’s go over the main steps:\n\nTip\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account to follow along. \n\n1. Define Your Goals & Audience\n\nBefore creating any content, you need to know two things: your goals and your audience.\n\nYour goals are the specific outcomes you want to achieve with your content marketing. \n\nFor example, you might want to increase site traffic by a certain percentage or drive a specific number of leads in support of a larger company goal. \n\nYour audience is the group of people you want to reach with your content.\n\nFor example, you might want to target bloggers in the food industry or recent college graduates seeking internships.\n\nThis step is critical.\n\nAnd here’s why:\n\nDefining your goals and audience guides your entire content strategy\nA solid strategy helps create content likely to resonate with your audience\nImpactful, relevant content leads to better ROI\n\nYou can quickly find your target audience by analyzing competitor audiences with One2Target. \n\nEnter up to five competitors’ domains, and the tool will gather information about their audiences’ demographics, socioeconomics, and behavior. \n\nLike this: \n\nHere are some additional steps you can take to define your goals and audience:\n\nReview your current performance. What are your strengths and weaknesses? What are your opportunities and threats?\nCreate your ideal customer personas. Who are they? What are their pain points, needs, and desires? How can you help them?\nConduct a competitor analysis. Who are your main competitors? What are they doing well and poorly? How can you differentiate yourself from them?\nSet the right types of goals. Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals make it easy to see whether you’re on track. For example, a SMART goal could be: “Increase organic traffic by 50% in the next six months.”\nChoose key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure progress. For example, common KPIs for content marketing are sessions, bounce rate, average engagement time, social shares, email subscribers, etc.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nTarget Audience: What It Is & How to Find Yours [+ Examples]\n16 Marketing KPIs You Need to Monitor\n2. Choose the Right Content Formats\n\nYou’ve defined your goals and audience. Now, you need to choose the best content types for your content marketing efforts.\n\nWe discussed some of these earlier, including:\n\nBlog posts\nEbooks\nVideos\nPodcast episodes\nWebinars\nCase studies\nSocial media posts\n\nDon’t know where to start?\n\nA great way is to reverse-engineer your competitors’ content strategies. See what’s working for them and replicate it in a better way. \n\nOpen Organic Research, enter any competitor’s domain, and head to the “Pages” tab. \n\nThis is a list of your competitor’s pages, conveniently sorted by the estimated amount of organic traffic they bring in. \n\nClick the icon next to the URL to see the actual page:\n\nBrowse through several of their top pages. And repeat this process for your main competitors. \n\nAs you do this, look for patterns.\n\nFor example:\n\nDo they use lots of visual assets?\nIs the content mostly long-form or short-form?\nAre the URLs mostly landing pages, ebooks, case studies, or something different?\n\nFollow a similar process using Social Tracker to see what kinds of social media content your competitors post. And what resonates with their audiences the most.\n\nAgain, review the content to look for patterns and ask questions. Then, use the answers to guide your content choices.\n\nHere are some additional tips for deciding which content types to use:\n\nAlign content types with your goals. Different content types have different purposes and benefits. For example, blog posts are great for driving traffic, ebooks are great for generating leads, and videos are great for increasing engagement.\nAlign content types with audience segments. Some content types appeal to different segments. For example, some audiences prefer visual content, some prefer audio content, and some prefer interactive content.\nExperiment and optimize. You don’t need to stick to one content type. In fact, you shouldn’t. Mix and match to see what works best. Track KPIs and adjust accordingly.\n\nAnalyze Your Competitors’ Content and SEO\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nFurther reading: 17 Types of Content Marketing to Use for Success\n\n3. Determine Your Content Topics\n\nStart with keyword research to find content ideas that are relevant to your brand, popular, and possible to rank highly for. \n\nAn effective way to do this is to enter a topic related to your brand into Topic Research. \n\nThen, click “Get content ideas.” \n\nThe tool will show related content ideas sorted by “Topic Efficiency.”\n\nThese are topics with high search volumes (a high number of average monthly searches) and low keyword difficulty (a low score that indicates you can feasibly rank for a given term). \n\nClick “Show more” on any card to see the search volume, difficulty score, popular headlines, related questions, and related searches for that topic. \n\nLike this:\n\nUse these ideas to create different content types around popular topics. \n\nPro tip\n\nConduct a keyword gap analysis with Keyword Gap to find keywords your competitors rank for but you don’t. Each of these keywords represents an opportunity for you to create content and capture more traffic. \n \n\n4. Create High-Quality Content\n\nYou’ve done the hard work involved in planning. \n\nNow, it’s time to create some high-quality content.\n\nThis can differ by platform. But most high-quality website content is:\n\nValuable to your audience\nOriginal and unique\nWell-researched and accurate\nWell-written and easy to read\nWell-designed and visually appealing\nOptimized for SEO and conversions\n\nOnce you’re ready to write, get help with the SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nStart a new document by writing your content directly in the editor, copying and pasting it from another document, or importing it from a URL. \n\nThen, fill out the remaining details and click “Get recommendations.”\n\nThe tool will analyze top-ranking pages and provide recommendations regarding readability, originality, tone of voice, and SEO. \n\nAdjust your content according to these recommendations. \n\nAnd as you do, the tool will update its assessment. \n\nHere are a few options for creating other types of content:\n\nAI Social Content Generator to help you create and publish social content\nAI Video Marketing Automator to create videos using AI\nLanding Page Builder to build and launch landing pages at scale\n\nFurther reading: SEO Writing: 16 Tips for Creating SEO-Optimized Content\n\n4. Share Your Content\n\nGreat content needs to be seen to do its job. Which is why promotion is so important.\n\nEffective content promotion can increase visibility and attract potential customers. \n\nSome content promotion tactics (many of which are content types themselves) include:\n\nSocial media: Use your social media platforms to share stand-alone posts and promote content on your site that you want to drive more people to\nPaid advertising: Use Google Ads to quickly get your content in front of more people\nEmail marketing: Send your subscribers new content and encourage them to read and share it\nContent syndication: Share your content on relevant, third-party sites to expand your reach\nDigital PR: Use tactics like media outreach to get your content featured in other publications\n\nNot all of these will work for you. \n\nSo, make sure to prioritize the ones that align with your goals and your audience. And test and iterate often. \n\nTip\n\nManaging multiple social media accounts can be overwhelming. Use our Social Media Toolkit to streamline your workflows, save time, and boost your content’s reach. \n \n\nFurther reading: The Ultimate Guide to Content Distribution (+ Examples)\n\n5. Monitor and Analyze Your Results\n\nYour final step is to monitor and analyze your results. So you can see how your content is performing and whether it’s helping you achieve your goals.\n\nHow?\n\nTry following these steps:\n\nUse analytics tools. These are tools that can help you measure and track your content performance, such as Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and Semrush.\nUse feedback tools. These are tools that can help you collect and analyze feedback from your audience, such as SurveyMonkey, Hotjar, and UserTesting.\nUse reporting tools. These are tools that can help you create and share reports on your content results, such as Google Looker Studio, Tableau, or Power BI.\nCompare results with your goals. See how your content is performing against your SMART goals. Identify what’s working, what’s not, test, and iterate.\nMake data-driven decisions. Based on your results and analysis, decide what actions you need to take to improve your marketing content. For example, you might want to create more or less content, change your content types or channels, or optimize your content for SEO or conversions.\nDevelop Your Content Marketing Skills\n\nThis guide gives you a solid start.
