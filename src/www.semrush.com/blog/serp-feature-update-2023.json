  "content": "Note: This article was originally published in April 2023. We’ve since updated it with information on more SERP features we’ve added to our toolkit in 2024.\n\nYou’re probably familiar with SERP features. We define them as any additional element on a search engine results page that adds something new to the typical format of a search result.\n\nWith these special results taking over Google, do you know how they’re helping or hindering your competitors? \n\nWe've just updated the data in Organic Research if you want access to that kind of data. Now, you can see if your competition is benefiting from the SERP features they rank for, and then use this data to find more opportunities for growth. \n\nWhat’s New? \n\nWe’ve made a lot of changes to help your site grow. Previously, SERP feature rankings and organic positions were grouped together in one row. Now, you can evaluate a site's organic rankings and SF rankings separately.\n\nYou can now track: \n\nA total of 49 SERP features on Google's search engine results pages\nSERP feature positions and estimated traffic separate from traditional organic positions \nSERP feature trends over time on a daily basis \nEstimated traffic a domain gets from SERP features alone\nWhich SERP Features Do We Now Track?\n\nWe’ve increased the amount of SERP features you can track from 38 to 49. The recent additions in 2024 we’ve made include:\n\nBuying guides\nThings to know\nDiscussions and forums\nExplore brands\nQuestions and answers\nDatasets\nOrganic carousel\nPopular stores\nPeople also search\nRefine\nAds Middle\n\nHere’s the full list:\n\nYou can see examples of all the SERP features we track on Semrush in our knowledge base. And you can see new SERP feature data in the following tools: \n\nOrganic Research\nDomain Overview\nKeyword Overview\nKeyword Magic Tool\n\nTip\n\nYou can now also track the presence of Google’s AI Overviews in our Position Tracking and Semrush Sensor tools.\n\nWhy Is It Important to Track SERP Feature Data?\n\nIn the past, Google’s first page had 10 blue links and as an SEO, you’d find appropriate keywords to rank for that coveted first position. \n\nBut the SERP landscape has changed so much that it takes more than ranking for the first position to attract your target audience.\n\nKevin Indig sums up this trend pretty well: \n\nGoogle’s showing more SERP features to help searchers. You should try to rank for all the SERP features your target keyword triggers, right? \n\nUnfortunately, it’s not so simple. \n\nRanking for a SERP feature doesn’t mean you’ll get more traffic. Look at this featured snippet below, for example. No need to click through because the answer is right there. \n\nThe solution? Taking a holistic approach when you’re looking for new keyword ideas.\n\nFor instance, continue to choose keywords based on the right intent, difficulty, and search volume. But now you can also factor in SERP features triggered by these keywords and the data that comes with that to get the whole picture. \n\nWithout doing this, you could be targeting keywords that may seem like they’ll attract search traffic and they just won’t. \n\nWays to Use SERP Data in Your SEO Strategy\n\nIt’s easier to build a competitive SEO strategy when you know what brings the most traffic to your competitor. \n\nSee which SERP features could lead to more traffic\n\nwith the Organic Research tool\n\nGet insights →\n\nPretend you're a digital marketer and your client is a food blogger looking to get more web traffic. Let’s see how you could help your client by understanding their competitor’s SERP feature strategy. \n\nConducting Competitive Analysis\n\nGo to Organic Research and type in the competitor’s domain. \n\nAfter, navigate to the Positions report. Here you can either filter for certain SERP features at the top or look at the SF and Positions columns. \n\nThen, you can see which SERP features are potentially driving the most traffic to their competitor by sorting by most to least traffic.\n\nAccording to this table, the entered domain gets an estimated 90.5K monthly visits from organic search because of one recipe SERP feature that links to the website:\n\nYou could help your client create content around an original espresso martini recipe and then markup that page with recipe schema to improve the chances of getting a similar spot on the SERP. \n\nNext, move to the Position Changes report.\n\nThis report shows you how a domain’s search position has changed for the keywords they rank for. You can analyze this month-over-month, day-to-day, or for any custom period. It also highlights which pages and keywords were most impacted by these changes.\n\nFirst, use the Position Changes Trend widget to get a bird’s eye view of the site's overall trend in three areas: changes in traffic, number of improved keywords, and number of declined keywords. Then, use the Top Page Changes chart to the right to identify the site pages that had the largest traffic change in the previous month.\n\nThe All Position Changes chart explores this data in greater detail.\n\nHere, you can compare a site’s position by keyword over time, including the amount of positions won or lost, and the change in traffic coming to the site from that keyword. \n\nThe “Changes on SERP” column shows you which changes on a SERP might have impacted your visibility on that page. For example, if your competitor lost a specific SERP feature, or if a new one appeared on the results page, you could find out by clicking on the figure in this column.\n\nUse this report to identify keywords and SERP features your competitor has recently lost, which you can win.\n\nTrack SERP Feature Volatility in Sensor\n\nAre you wondering how much movement there is among SERP features in your niche?\n\nSemrush Sensor can show you. This tool has the ability to track volatility among 25 industries and 38 SERP features. \n\nSemrush Sensor shows you SERP volatility in 25 industries and 38 SERP features.\n\nIf there’s a lot of change among featured snippets, AI Overviews, people also ask boxes, or local packs, you can find out.\n\nHigh volatility means it could be your time to shine… or, time to make sure you aren’t losing your spotlight!\n\nHone in on a specific SERP feature's movement in any industry\nHow Do We Collect Data on SERP Features?\n\nThere are 3 types of SERP features that we track:\n\n1) SERP features that enrich an organic position \n\nAlso known as “rich results,” these features add more information to an existing organic position. Examples include sitelinks, reviews, images, and videos.\n\nIn our toolkit, they’re represented by their unique SERP feature icon and position number. \n\n2) SERP features that are independent of an organic position \n\nThe second group is SERP features that are detached from a standard organic ranking. Examples include knowledge panels, Twitter carousels, and recipe blocks. \n\nThey’re represented only with their unique SERP feature icon in the Positions column. There is no specific position we can attach to these because they are not directly tied to a “traditional” organic listing, like sitelinks or review stars. \n\n3) SERP features that don’t link to a domain \n\nThe last group of SERP features we can analyze either don’t link to a domain at all, or we can’t gather that data at this time. Examples in this category include instant answers, featured images, and flights.\n\nWhen you’re in Organic Research, you’ll be able to know when one of these features is on a keyword’s SERP because it will be listed in the “SF\" column. \n\nYou can sort that information using the new filter in Organic Research. \n\nSee Which SERP Features Are Helping Your Competitors\n\nWhen you have data to help you make decisions, you make better decisions. We think this update will allow you to:\n\nConduct better competitive analyses\nAnalyze SERPs faster\nFind hidden SEO insights \nFind more opportunities for search traffic \nReport growth on a granular level \n\nSo, start analyzing your competitor's SERP features before they analyze yours. Then, come up with a plan that will get your brand all over the SERPs—and watch your traffic roll in.\n\nRead more about the new SERP features you can now track with the links below.\n\nShort Videos\nWeb Stories\nApplication\nApplication List\nRecipes\nTwitter Carousel\nFind Results On\nIndented\nNews\nEvents\nAddress Pack\nSee Results About\nRelated Products\nPopular Products\nBuying Guide\nOrganic Carousel\nThings to Know\nDatasets\nDiscussions and Forums\nExplore Brands\nQuestions and Answers\nPopular Stores\nRefine\nPeople Also Search\nAds (Middle)\n\n\nSee which SERP features could lead to more traffic\n\nwith the Organic Research tool\n\nGet insights →",
