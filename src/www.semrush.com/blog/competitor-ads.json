  "content": "The world of digital ads is fast and crowded. Marketers have to know their competitors and their advertising strategies to stay relevant and stand out. But to do so, you first need the right tools.\n\nAdClarity and Advertising Research can help you see your competitor's ads, monitor and analyze them, and make smart, data-driven decisions.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nWhy Competitive Advertising Research Matters\n\nAd campaigns don’t exist in a vacuum. Whenever and wherever your customer sees your ad, the likelihood is that they’re also seeing other ads from your competitors. You’ll need to know what your ad looks like in that context – how does it fare next to your competitors’ work?\n\nCompetitive advertising research also ensures that you’re aware of what messaging, design, and other tactics your competitors are using in their ads. \n\nFor example, you could discover that your competitors’ video ads perform best on social media, and you could prioritize your own video ad production there and reap higher returns.\n\nFurther, you can determine what kind of video ads perform best. Are they high-production value or are they using UGC (user generated content) in their ads? \n\nLook at what works for your competitors so you don’t have to start from scratch. \n\nTo take the guesswork out of this process, use AdClarity for display advertising research and Advertising Research for studying search advertising competitors.\n\nSee All of Your Competitor's Ads\n\nwith AdClarity - Advertising Intelligence\n\nTry it Free →\nDisplay & Social Media Ad Competitor Analysis\n\nAdClarity can conduct ad research for your competitors’ Google display and social media ads. The app reveals: \n\nAny advertisers’ top ads and campaigns \nTop publishers \nAd types distribution\nEstimates of your competitors’ ad spend (and expenditure breakdown)\n\nWith this information, you can make a complete comparison of your ad strategy with that of your competitors’, and shape your next steps accordingly. \n\nLet’s take a look at how to get started.\n\nSetting Up Your AdClarity Account\n\nAdClarity is available to anyone with a Semrush account – including a free account or a trial period. After that, the app is subscription based and plan prices vary according to the tier you select.\n\nTo start using AdClarity, follow this link and click Try it free.\n\nThen, select the marketing channel(s) you want to focus on. \n\nHere, you can either sign-up to a paid plan, or click Try for free to continue to a trial period of the tool.\n\nIdentifying Key Competitors\n\nOnce you have access to the AdClarity dashboard, you’ll need to enter your competitors in the top search bar. You can add up to 10 competitors at a time.\n\nPerhaps you already know your competitors and can jump straight in. \n\nIf not, the Advertising Competitors report from Semrush lists websites that compete most with your current Google Ads campaigns for paid keywords. \n\nThese paid search competitors could overlap with your paid Google display and social media competitors, and so are a good place to begin.\n\nPro tip: If you’ve never run Google Ads, the Organic Research Competitors report can help. This report shows domains that compete with your website for organic keyword rankings. To use it, simply enter your URL in the search bar and click Search.\n\nExploring Competitor Campaigns\n\nOnce you’ve entered your competitor(s) in AdClarity, you can click on the left-hand tab below the search bar to select the marketing channel you want to focus on. \n\nChoose between all channels, display, social, or video.\n\nIn the tabs to the right, you can refine your search by device type, time frame, and location. For example, you could look at your competitors’ ads across all channels on desktop devices over the last seven days in the US.\n\nThe time frame filter offers options such as the last seven days, 30 days, three months, 12 months, or a custom date. This functionality allows you to gain ad insights into both active and historical ad campaigns. \n\nAnalyzing Creatives and Ad Formats\n\nKnowing what your competitors’ ads look like is a huge component of curating your ad strategy. With AdClarity, you can dive into the creatives, formats, and messaging of your competitors’ ads and detect what resonates with audiences.\n\nTo get going, click the ‘Compare’ button at the far right of the AdClarity dashboard.\n\nNext, enter another one of your competitors. In this case, we’ll select Walmart (a known competitor of Amazon). \n\nHit the Compare button in the bottom right of the box, and you’ll be taken to a screen with a full breakdown of your two competitors’ ads.\n\nScroll down to the Top Ads section, where you can view your competitor ads that have the highest number of impressions in your specified time frame.\n\nClick on each ad for more details about the ad format, dimensions, spend, and publishers.\n\nFrom here, you can take notes about the ad format, copy, design, and overall aesthetics of your competitors’ top performing ads. You can draw parallels between ads, and recognize what types of ads are received well by audiences. \n\nFor example, you might notice that both your competitors predominantly use banner formats, informal language, have strong color contrasts, and no interactive elements in their best ads. \n\nThis knowledge can fuel your creative efforts when you make your own ads.\n\nSimilarly, underneath in the Top campaigns section, you can see each of your competitors’ most successful ad campaigns. \n\nThe ad campaigns here are listed based on the campaign landing page. Click on “View all campaigns” to see a breakdown of your competitor’s campaign strategy. \n\nHere’s what we see from walmart.com. This is telling us that the “School Supplies” campaign ran on all three channels, made 2.35B impressions and cost $23.4M over the selected time frame.\n\nJust click on any campaign from this table to see a detailed report of any specific campaign. \n\nFor example, here’s the top of the report on Walmart’s “School Supplies” campaign. \n\nThen, scroll down to see what the campaign looked like with the top ads. \n\nBrowse through these ads and analyze your competitor’s messaging strategy. \n\nAssess the ad formats, design, storytelling, and more – all which can be applied to your ad campaigns moving forward.\n\nMonitoring Ad Placements and Channels\n\nNow that you have your ad creative research compiled, let’s move to where your competitors are putting their ads.\n\nBack at the top of the AdClarity dashboard, the middle widget displays your competitor’s ad types distribution. \n\nFor Amazon, we’re told that in the last seven days, 36.40% of the retailer’s ads were social ads, 35.37% were banner ads, and 28.23% were video ads. \n\nScroll down to Top publishers and apps and you can view the channels where your competitors’ ads are being featured.\n\nKeeping with the Amazon example, we’re shown that Pinterest, YouTube, and Twitch have the highest number of impressions for Amazon’s ads over the given period of time. \n\nThis data can tell you where your competitors are having the biggest impact. By knowing the places they target the most, you can plan to compete and outperform others in your industry. \n\nLikewise, you can find the underutilized channels that your competitors are missing, giving you the opportunity to experiment with ad placements in those areas and make a bigger splash because there’s little or no competition.\n\nAssessing Ad Spend and Performance\n\nBudget is unsurprisingly a significant step in researching your competitors’ ads. Knowing what your competitors are spending on ads enables you to allocate your budget more strategically.\n\nAdClarity estimates your entered competitors’ expenditure, ad buying methods, expenditure trends, and expenditure breakdown.\n\nBelow is the estimated expenditure for Amazon over the last seven days. The retailer spent approximately $36.5M in the time, and received 6.2B ad impressions during this period.\n\nTo the right of this widget, the tool gives a summary of Amazon’s ad buying methods. The majority of ad purchases were programmatic (60.92%), followed by direct (23.58%), and ad network purchases (15.50%).\n \n\nUsing this information, you can determine how you want to purchase ads, and how that strategy aligns with your available budget. \n\nUnderneath Ad buying methods is the Advertiser expenditure trends graph. Select Impressions, Spend or Publishers from the top of the graph (two options at a time) and view the metrics over your specified time.\n\nWith the graph, you can visualize any correlations between the metrics, as well as any noticeable seasonality. For example, you may conclude that Amazon’s ad spend and impressions dip toward the end of the week. \n\nYou could then refine your ad campaign to invest less in ads that appear on the same platforms at the end of the week.\n\nFurther down, the Advertiser expenditure breakdown widget highlights the publishers, distribution of publishers, Share of Voice (SoV), spend, and distribution of your competitors’ spend for display, video, and social ads.\n \n\nWe learn that while Amazon’s display ads have the widest publishers and distribution, the retailer spends the most on video ads. Meanwhile, its social ads have the highest impressions and SoV. \n\nThis information empowers your brand to make smarter, informed decisions when crafting your ad strategy. \n\nBy recognising what tactics your competitors have used to produce the most ROI, you can confidently align your own ad spend with improved ad performance.\n\nGoogle Ads Competitor Analysis\n\nGoogle Ads is the leading advertising platform, and it makes sense to assign a good chunk of your competitor ad research to Google search ads.\n\nThis allows you to discover competitors’ ad tactics at scale and gather ideas for your campaigns.\n\nWondering how to check competitors’ Google search ads? The Advertising Research tool helps you find competitor ads, analyze their keywords, review their ad copies and history, and explore their landing pages.\n\nTo get going, open your Semrush account and select the Advertising tab on the left-hand side. Underneath Market Analysis, click Advertising Research.\n\nNext, you’ll be shown a search bar to enter your competitor(s) and the location you want to focus your research on. We’ll stick to Amazon, and center on the US.\n\nOnce you hit Search, you’ll see the Advertising Research dashboard. The Competitors tab located above the data will help you pinpoint your Google ads competitors. \n\nThe list is compiled based on the number of keywords that brands’ ads share with yours. The more keywords that you share, the stronger a competitor the brand is to you. For Amazon then, we see that eBay, Wayfair, and Uline are its main ad competitors.\n\nYou can click on any of the listed competitors – this time we’ll select ebay. You’ll be taken to a dashboard under the tab Positions, showing a full breakdown of their keywords, traffic, and traffic cost. You can also view their paid search trends and the paid search positions.\n\nThe Positions report is an extensive list of your competitor’s keywords, which can give you an indication of the terms you should be targeting.\n\nin the Ads Copies tab, you can take a look at the text that your competitor includes in their ads. This tab shows the exact ad copy and the links to landing pages within your competitors’ ads.\n\nOver in the Ads History tab you can see how your competitors’ ad strategy has evolved over time. Sticking with eBay, we can see a 12-month overview of the keywords eBay has paid for and the positions they rank for with those keywords.\n\nThis section is helpful for ad research because it reveals the keywords that your competitors consistently bid on and their rankings for those terms.\n\nBy clicking on any blue cell, you can also see the exact ad copies that used a particular keyword that month. This helps identify recurring themes in successful ad campaigns that you can apply to your own ad strategy. \n\nIn the Pages tab tool, you’ll see the top landing pages of your competitors, including the traffic, keywords, and backlinks per page. \n\nThese landing pages are important because they tell you how your competitors convince people to take action.\n\nFor example, we can see that eBay’s top landing page for August had an estimated 41.7K visitors and ranked for eight paid keywords.\n\nBy clicking on the link, we can see the complete page.\n\nHaving direct access to your competitors’ landing pages means you can take into account the layout, design, copy, CTAs, page speed, and other crucial factors that influence customers’ decisions to convert. \n\nKnowing the Lay of the Ad Land\n\nYour competitors’ ads give you a clear picture of the competitive landscape. Which can be a valuable starting point to devise a powerful ad strategy of your own. \n\nNot only can your competitors’ ads inspire you, they can shine a light on what areas and tactics haven’t been tapped yet – giving you a huge competitive edge.\n\nMake your ad research easier and more effective with AdClarity in the Semrush App Center, and the Advertising Research tool from the main Semrush interface. \n\nGet going today with a free trial or demo, and really cut through the competitive noise.\n\nResearch Your Competitor's Ads\n\nwith AdClarity - Advertising Intelligence\n\nTry it Free →",
