Click on the plugin\n\nThen, click \"Install and activate.\"\n\nNow, you'll see a \"Yoast SEO\" option in your WordPress left-hand menu. Click it to access the Yoast SEO dashboard.\n\nClick the \"First-time configuration\" tab in the Yoast SEO dashboard.\n\nYoast SEO will guide you through a basic configuration.\n\nFollow the prompts to complete the setup. \n\nFor example, you’ll add information about your business in the “Site Representation” part.\n\nAnd add the URLs for your social media profiles in the “Social Profiles” section.\n\nNext, enable the Semrush integration to combine Yoast’s powerful SEO tools with Semrush’s database of over 26 billion keywords.\n\nClick “Yoast SEO” in your WordPress dashboard, followed by “Integrations.” \n\nUnder the \"Recommended integrations\" section, click to toggle on the Semrush integration.\n\nNow, you’ll be able to see and add additional keywords to your content. To increase your chances of ranking for additional search terms and driving more organic traffic to your site. (We'll explain how to do this later on.)\n\nHow to Optimize Your Content with Yoast SEO \n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to use Yoast SEO to create content that stands a good chance of ranking well in search engines:\n\n1. Enter Your ​​Target Keyword\n\nFind the Yoast SEO box below your WordPress editor (or in the sidebar if you're using the block editor), and enter your primary keyword in the “Focus keyphrase” field. Which is the primary term you want your page to rank for, given it’s of interest to your target audience.\n\nIf you need help determining which primary keywords to target, use Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a broad seed keyword (like \"vegan cooking\") and your website's domain (e.g., “loveandlemons.com”), select your target location (such as the U.S.), and click \"Search.\" \n\nYou can then evaluate the following to help you determine what keywords to target:\n\nSearch intent (Intent): The underlying goal of a user's search. Understanding this helps you create content that truly meets their needs. Keywords can be categorized as transactional, commercial, navigational, and/or informational.\nSearch volume (Volume): Higher search volume generally means more potential traffic. But it can also mean more competition.\nPersonal Keyword Difficulty (PKD %): Estimates how challenging it will be for your specific website to rank in the top 10 results for this keyword. Lower PKD % indicates an easier keyword to target.\n\nIn the \"Personal KD%\" drop-down, choose \"Very easy\" or \"Easy\" to find the best keywords for your site.\n\nLook for keywords with a reasonably high search volume and a low PKD % score. For example, some good keywords for Love & Lemons could be:\n\n“vegan slow cooker recipes”\n“vegan cook books”\n“vegan chili slow cooker”\n\nAfter conducting keyword research, you decide to create an article about \"vegan slow cooker recipes.\" \n\nYou'll enter this phrase into the \"Focus keyphrase\" field to start optimizing your content. \n\nAs you start filling your page with content, the Yoast SEO plugin will analyze it for your chosen keyword and offer suggestions to help you optimize for better search visibility within the “SEO analysis” section.\n\nFor example, your keyphrase not appearing in your first paragraph or the title of your article.\n\n2. Use the Semrush Integration to Find More Keywords\n\nChoosing a primary keyword is a great way to reach your intended audience. But if you also target some additional, related terms, you can rank for even more valuable keywords. \n\nNote\n\nThe Semrush integration is most useful if you have a Yoast SEO Premium account.\n\nIn the Yoast SEO box, click the “Get related keyphrases” button under “Focus keyphrase.”\n\nThis will trigger a new window to open, prompting you to log in or sign up for a Semrush account. \n\nThen, select your database to see a list of related keyphrases along with these data points:\n\nVolume: The average number of monthly searches for that keyword\nTrend: A visual representation of how search volume has changed over the last 12 months\n\nClick on \"Get more insights at Semrush\" to access even more detailed keyword data within the Semrush platform.\n\nThis will open the Keyword Overview tool in Semrush, providing in-depth analysis for your focus keyphrase.\n\nScroll down to the “Keyword ideas” section and click “View all # keywords” to see a list of related keywords.\n\nYou can use any relevant terms to expand the reach of your content in search results. Which might drive more clicks to your site.\n\nIn the case of this vegan slow cooker recipes article, you could add sections like:\n\n“easy vegan slow cooker recipes”\n“healthy vegan slow cooker recipes”\n\nThis will not only provide additional value to readers but also increase the chances of the article appearing in search results for related keywords. \n\nConsider upgrading to Yoast SEO Premium to easily add these related terms as secondary keywords directly within the WordPress editor.\n\nCollect Keyword Metrics\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Add a Title Tag, Meta Description, and URL Slug \n\nYoast provides fields where you can customize your content's title tag (HTML that specifies the page title and may show in search results), meta description (HTML that provides a page summary and may show in search results), and URL slug (the end part of the URL that identifies the page).\n\nHere are some tips for writing each:\n\nTitle tag: Write a headline that accurately reflects your content and entices users to click. Include your focus keyphrase, ideally at the beginning. Keep it under 60 characters to avoid truncation if it shows in search results. \nMeta description: Write a concise and informative summary of your content, highlighting its unique value proposition. Aim for 150-160 characters to ensure the full description is displayed if it shows in search results.\nURL slug: Create a short, descriptive URL that includes your focus keyword. Avoid unnecessary words or characters and use hyphens to separate words for readability.\n\nYoast's snippet preview feature lets you see how your title tag and meta description may appear in search results. \n\nYou can then make adjustments to ensure they're clear, compelling, and likely to attract user clicks. Which can improve your organic click-through rate (CTR).\n\nFor example, you might use the following title tag, meta description, and URL slug for an article about “vegan slow cooker recipes.” \n\n4. Review the SEO Analysis\n\nAfter entering your focus keyphrase(s) and writing your content, Yoast SEO will analyze your page and provide color-coded feedback:\n\nGreen: Indicates items you’ve done a good job of optimizing\nOrange: Suggests areas where improvements can be made\nRed: Highlights more serious issues that need to be addressed\n\nFor example, a common SEO problem is not including your keyword in your title tag (which Yoast SEO calls an “SEO title”)—a ranking factor. \n\nIf you need help implementing any recommendations, click the corresponding hyperlinked text. Which will open up a resource explaining the issue and what you can do to address it. \n\n5. Review the Readability Analysis\n\nYoast SEO doesn't just focus on SEO. It also helps you create reader-friendly content that keeps your audience engaged and coming back for more. \n\nThis is especially valuable for businesses looking to generate leads or increase sales directly from their websites.\n\nThe readability analysis evaluates your writing style and provides recommendations for sentence length, paragraph length, transition word use, passive voice use, and other factors influencing how easy it is to understand your content.\n\nLike the SEO analysis, the readability analysis uses a color-coded system (green, orange, and red) to clearly show which areas of your content are strong and which need improvement.\n\nYou can also use Semrush's SEO Writing Assistant to refine your content's SEO and readability. This tool analyzes your text in real-time and provides suggestions for improving keyword use, readability, tone of voice, and originality.\n\nTo get started, click “Analyze my text.” \n\nYou can either type or paste your text directly into the tool. Or, click \"Import text from web\" to import the text from a specific URL.\n\nAdd your target keyword(s), populate the editor with your content, select your target audience, and click “Get recommendations.”\n\nOn the right-hand side, you’ll see a list of actionable suggestions to enhance your content's overall quality divided into four categories:\n\nReadability\nSEO\nTone of voice\nOriginality\n\nApply the suggestions in each category to improve your content in real-time.\n\nYou can then transfer the article to your WordPress editor and continue.\n\nReview Your Drafts in Real Time\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign Up Now →\n6. Add Schema Markup\n\nSchema markup is code you can add to webpages to help search engines understand your content better. Which can lead to rich results—search listings that display additional information about your page and can attract more attention and clicks.\n\nFor example, this is what recipe schema can appear like in search engine results pages (SERPs):\n\nGo to the \"Schema\" tab in the Yoast SEO box.\n\nThen, select the appropriate schema type for your page. (Yoast provides a schema guide to help.)\n\n7. Edit Social Sharing Settings\n\nYoast SEO gives you control over how your content appears on social media platforms like Facebook, X, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. This is to help you control how your content appears when shared on these platforms.\n\nYou do this by customizing the Open Graph tags associated with your content. These tags are snippets of code that tell social media platforms what information to display when your content is shared.\n\nNote\n\nThis feature is only available in Yoast SEO Premium.\n\nIn Yoast SEO, you can customize the:\n\nSocial image: Choose a featured image displayed with your social media post to ensure it has the correct file size and dimensions for optimal display\nSocial title: Set a custom title for social media sharing that differs from your post title/title tag if needed\nSocial description: Craft a platform-specific description that will entice users to click on your shared content\n\nYou can find the social sharing settings under the “Social” tab.\n\nFor example, let's say we want to share our blog post on organic traffic. When shared on social media, it could look something like this:\n\nAdditional Yoast SEO Settings to Consider\n\nLet's explore some key settings beyond the default options that can enhance your SEO efforts.\n\nImprove Google’s Understanding of Your Company\n\nWe've already touched on how Yoast SEO can help you implement schema markup on individual pages. But it's worth mentioning the option to easily add organization schema. Which provides search engines with key information about your company as a whole.\n\nNote\n\nThis feature is only available in Yoast SEO Premium.\n\nThis structured data can increase the likelihood of your business information appearing in a prominent \"knowledge panel\" in search results.\n\nHere's what our knowledge panel looks like:\n\nIn your WordPress dashboard menu, click on \"Yoast SEO\" > \"Settings\" > \"Site representation.\"\n\nScroll down to the \"Additional organization info\" section and fill out the available fields (organization description, email address, phone number, etc.).\n\nSimplify Site Verification\n\nYoast SEO simplifies connecting your site to essential tools that require manual verification. It allows you to add different platforms' verification codes in one central place.\n\nThis is far easier than individually adding each verification snippet to your website code.\n\nTo verify your site using Yoast SEO, follow these steps:\n\nIn your WordPress dashboard, go to \"Yoast SEO\" > \"Settings\" > \"Site connections\"\n\nPaste the verification codes into the corresponding fields and click the \"Save changes\" button.\n\nReturn to each respective platform's website and follow its instructions to complete the verification process.\n\nEnhance Navigation\n\nYoast gives you a simple way to implement breadcrumbs. Which are a navigational trail of links that help users more easily find their way around your site and boost SEO by helping search engines better understand your site structure. \n\nHere’s how we use breadcrumbs on the Semrush blog to let readers know what category and subcategory the article falls in.\n\nTo enable and customize breadcrumbs, go to your WordPress dashboard. And navigate to “Yoast SEO” > “Settings” > “Advanced” > “Breadcrumbs.”\n\nThen, scroll to the bottom and turn on the toggle next to “Enable breadcrumbs for your theme.”\n\nAfter that, you can customize how breadcrumbs look and behave on your site.\n\nImprove Site Speed with Crawl Optimization\n\nYoast SEO can help search engines crawl your site more efficiently by removing unnecessary elements from its code. This reduces the number of unnecessary URLs that search engines have to crawl, which can help improve your site's speed.\n\nTo access these settings:\n\nGo to \"Advanced\" > \"Crawl optimization.\"\n\nThen, carefully review each option and remove anything your site doesn't need.\n\nFor example, the \"generator tag\" is a snippet of code automatically added by WordPress that reveals the exact version of WordPress your site is running. \n\nIt has no SEO value and is a potential security threat. Because publicly displaying your WordPress version can make your site a target for hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in specific versions.\n\nYou can easily remove it using the toggle.\n\nFor a more in-depth understanding of how well search engines can crawl your site, use Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nEnter your URL in the search bar and click “Start Audit.”\n\nNext, configure your Site Audit. And click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nOnce the audit is complete, you'll see an overview of your site's technical health. \n\nNext, click on the “Issues” tab. Then select “Crawlability” from the “Category” drop-down menu.\n\nYou’ll then see a list of crawlability issues on your site that you can fix. \n\nFor each flagged issue, hover over the \"Why and how to fix it\" link for detailed instructions on how to address it and improve your site's performance.\n\nYou might also see a \"Learn more\" link. This offers additional context or information about the issue being analyzed, even if it's not currently causing a problem for your site.\n\nYou can also click on each issue for a more detailed explanation and to see which specific URLs are causing the problem. \n\nFind and Fix Crawlability Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nTake Control of Your SEO \n\nYoast SEO lays the foundation for a well-optimized WordPress site. And incorporating Semrush into your processes can lead to even better performance.\n\nIn addition to the integration with Yoast, Semrush offers a whole host of SEO tools you can use to:\n\nUncover hidden keyword opportunities\nOptimize your content \nImprove your overall site health\nTrack your progress\n\nSign up for a free trial today.\n\nElevate Your Digital Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
