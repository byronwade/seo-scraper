  "content": "What Is a Case Study & Why Is It Valuable?\n\nIn the business world, a case study is written or video content that tells the story of a successful customer transaction, relationship, or both. \n\nCase studies combine storytelling and data to offer social proof that your product is a viable solution to your target customers’ problems.\n\nLet’s take Semrush’s SEO case study, “How an SEO Agency Helped an Artisan Bakery Increase Mobile Organic Traffic by 460%.” \n\nIt sends a clear message:\n\nBakeries that don’t get enough mobile traffic can leverage Semrush tools to grow exponentially.\n\nA compelling case study can win you new customers. \n\nConsider it a highly valuable business card—and an honest showcase of your positive impact in action. Which helps you earn the trust of your intended audience. \n\nTo really reap the benefits of making case studies part of your content marketing strategy, it’s crucial to know how to write a case study effectively.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll walk you through the essential steps for crafting a case study that can convert your prospects into loyal buyers.\n\nHow to Prepare a Case Study: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nPreparing a case study involves choosing the right customers to feature in your analysis. Plus gathering enough data, quotes, and information to narrate a compelling, real-lifesuccess story.\n\nA great case study will contain five essential elements:\n\nWithout proper preparation, your case study won’t have enough details to be strongly relatable, convincing, or reassuring.\n\nTo help you streamline your process, use the prep section of our free case study template and follow the suggested research method below.\n\nStep 1: Set Your Objectives\n\nSpecificity makes a case study more relatable and, therefore, more effective. \n\nStart by defining the reason you’re presenting this particular story to determine which specific solutions and features to highlight. \n\nFor instance, a general objective like “showcase our solution in action” is a good start, but it doesn’t offer a lot of direction. \n\nWhat, specifically, will you highlight? What results do you hope to achieve? \n\nThis is a good place to remember the SMART framework.\n\nSay your business provides customer relationship management (CRM) software. Your overall goal: to expand your reach in the healthcare sector. \n\nIf your existing healthcare customers often praise your workflow automation tools, you know automation matters to your target audience. So, efficiency could be an engaging case study topic.\n\nFor this case study, your objective may be: \n\n“Show how our workflow automation saved one hospital X hours per week and reduced errors to support our goal of getting 10 more healthcare subscribers by the end of the year.”\n\nCustomer interactions and reviews can offer great guidance on which features to spotlight to fulfill your objective. \n\nLook at your high-performing web content for inspiration, too. \n\nIf Google Analytics (or an alternative) shows that a blog post on reducing data breach risks is your most popular, you’ll know that your audience values security. \n\nYou could build a case study around security credentials to reassure those prospective buyers.\n\nStep 2: Choose the Perfect Customer (and Get Them on Board)\n\nThe right subject for your story will play a pivotal role in showcasing your offering—helping you gain an edge over the competition.\n\nA suitable customer is one that:\n\nHas a compelling story to tell. The customer has had a great experience with your product or a specific feature. They’re pleased with the results and happy to shout about it.\nIs typical of businesses in their sector. The customer is relatable to your target audience. They deal with the same challenges and have similar spending power.\nIs ready and able to talk. You have a strong relationship with this contact. They will help you pull the story together and have the authority to approve content for publishing.\n\nPrioritize customers that came to you after experiencing your competitors—known as switchers. Their stories will highlight your competitive advantages and could sway a buyer who’s comparing options.\n\nChoose a recognizable customer name if you can. This may help readers trust your business’s legitimacy. \n\nFor instance, all of Asana’s case studies involve big-name customers. \n\nImage Source: Asana\n\nThis is despite the company having more than 139,000 users, many of which are small businesses.\n\nOpt for a mix of business types, industries, and sizes that your company is keen to work with. \n\nFor instance, if you typically target sales organizations but want to reach a marketing audience, choose stories with marketing elements or that involve marketing agencies.\n\nOnce you’ve decided on a compelling story to feature, get the customer on board by telling them your plan. \n\nExplain that you’ll need some input during the creation process but will do most of the work. Be clear that you’re proud of the relationship you’ve built with them and will use it to inspire others.\n\nIf they agree to help, move forward. If they decline, pick another company from your list. \n\nStep 3: Compile Your Customer and Story Information\n\nWrite down what you know about your customer, their relationship with your business, and how they’ve used your product. This information will help you plot your success story and identify any knowledge gaps.\n\nShare a live notes document with your relevant team members and encourage their input. They may have additional customer or business insights that could prove useful to the case study.\n\nInclude details such as:\n\nThe customer’s background. What does the company do and when was it formed? What is its market position? What are its industry’s classic challenges? \nThe exact product they use. What features does your customer use? What plan are they on? A premium account? Do they pay for extra add-ons?\nThe date of their first purchase. How long have they been a customer? Loyalty is a powerful case study theme—use it if you can.\nTheir interaction history. Support records will show if the customer has overcome issues while using your product. Check your CRM, ticketing system, or email accounts for details.\nThe inspirational outcome. What inspired you to choose this customer as a case study subject? It could be a testimonial, a social media post, a passing comment, or direct feedback.\n\nUse what you learn to inspire interview questions for the next step. \n\nPro tip\n\nA tool like Semrush’s Market Explorer can help you pin down your customer’s market share and industry details. To accurately tailor your case study to reach its relevant target audience.\n\nStep 4: Interview Your Customer (Example Case Study Questions)\n\nSpeak directly to the customer to get any information you don’t already have. Ask questions that will make your case study content engaging and relatable.\n\nSupplement your notes for the previous step with questions that’ll help you fill in the gaps for each section. Such as:\n\nThe interview process doesn’t need to be formal. The chat could even form part of a regular catch-up if the timing works. \n\nRecord the conversation so you can refer back to it while writing. Like on Zoom. \n\nYou may find you can take some direct quotes from your recording. If not, ask the customer for a testimonial you can use in the final content.\n\nStep 5: Set the Customer’s Expectations\n\nLet the customer know your next steps (e.g., writing and editing the content, sourcing direct interview quotations). Explain that you’ll be back in touch if you need any further information.\n\nProvide a timeline so the customer is prepared to review your drafts, give extra detail, and seek further approval if necessary.\n\nBe clear that you won’t take up much of the customer’s time as you don’t want to distract them. If the process were to become demanding for them, you risk souring your relationship. \n\nHow to Structure Your Case Study\n\nFollow a standardized process when creating any business case study to ensure you:\n\nInclude all the core elements\nKeep your page content consistent and easily navigable\n\nFollow the instructions in the case study structure section of our free template.\n\n1. Choose a Descriptive and Specific Headline\n\nA case study headline is the first thing readers see. Use yours to grab attention and set readers’ expectations. Otherwise, it could be the only part they see.\n\nA good case study headline answers common questions that go through every reader’s head, like:\n\nIs this relevant to me?\nWhat will I learn?\nHow will this help my business?\n\nTake this Textel case study:\n\nImage Source: Textel\n\nThe business texting platform uses just 77 characters to tell us a story, including:\n\nWho’s involved (“Valvoline...”)\nWhat they achieved (“Increases Coupon Send Rate by 76%”)\nHow they did it (“with Textel’s MMS Picture Texting”)\n\nFrom this information, readers can immediately determine whether the content is:\n\nRelevant: Either using the brand name (e.g., “I recognize this business; are we comparable?”) or the achievement (“I’d also like to increase my business’s coupon send rate”)\nValuable: An impressive headline stat implies what’s possible for the reader\n2. Highlight 3-5 Points Summarizing the Story and Its Results\n\nInclude a snapshot of results early on so people are encouraged to keep on reading. You can present them in a bullet list or even as custom icons.\n\nFor instance, if the headline in Textel’s case study isn’t enough, their “At a Glance” column allows readers to make sure the content is relevant to them.\n\nImage Source: Textel\n\nThink of it as an executive summary of the main body copy. Putting it together is easy: just go through the finished content and pick out the most important points.\n\n3. Include Relevant Images\n\nImages serve to break up the text and engage readers. Use high-profile logos to communicate status quickly, screenshots of results, images of happy customers, or custom designs.\n\nThe Textel example takes up valuable real estate up front with a large image. \n\nIt also includes the client’s logo. Valvoline’s chevron will be recognizable to its audience and can help build credibility. \n\n4. Introduce Your Customer\n\nGive your case study context with a short introduction. Background information on the subject will paint a picture of your story’s main character.\n\nProvide customer details such as their industry and product offering, company size, and location. Optional profile additions can include their mission statement and major milestones. \n\nThis introduction helps readers care about the actions and achievements they’re preparing to explore. The more relatable your subject is, the more invested readers will be.\n\nIn one of its marketing case studies (“Local Hospital's Social Media Engagement Soars 892%”), marketing agency Captivate introduces its client with basic information on location, history, and purpose.\n\nImage Source: Captivate\n\nFrom then on, the reader can envisage the organization going through the challenges and receiving the benefits. The case study suddenly feels more real.\n\nThe final sentence in Captivate’s introduction adds a human element, encouraging the reader to empathize with the subject: \n\n“On top of treatment, Navicent maintains deep involvement in their community.”\n\nThe more color you provide here, the more potentially impactful your case study’s results will be. \n\n5. Describe the Challenge\n\nThe beginning of your story should lay out the customer’s problem: their difficult position before finding your product.\n\nEnsure your customer is always the most important figure. Focus too much on yourself, and you’ll jeopardize the sincerity of your case study.\n\nYou don’t need to provide a lot of detail here. A couple of short paragraphs should give your outcomes enough context. \n\nAnswer important questions like:\n\nWhat stood in the way of the customer achieving their goals? \nWhat were the consequences?\n\nMake the challenge relevant to your target audience by using language they can relate to and including your customer’s words.\n\nTake this case study from Rev:\n\nImage Source: Rev\n\nThe copy clearly states that without a reliable transcription service (i.e., Rev’s product), the client wasted time correcting the errors made by automation tech. \n\nKnowing there’s something significant at stake—in this case, employees’ time and students’ learning experiences—gives your audience a reason to continue reading.\n\nHave the customer describe the challenge in their own words. It’s a great way to add honesty and emotion to your story, making it even more engaging and relatable.\n\n6. Highlight Your Solution\n\nThis is where your business enters the customer story. \n\nBriefly introduce your product. Explain what it does and what makes it unique, then apply it to the problems your customer was experiencing. \n\nHere’s a hypothetical example:\n\n“Our customer needed IT support for teams in different time zones to avoid service delays. Our 24/7 IT support package meant those teams could get the help they needed at any time, with 30-minute response times guaranteed.”\n\nTalk about which teams or employees benefited from the product and how they used it. Details of any premium features or add-ons create an even clearer picture, ensuring readers understand how to achieve similar results. \n\nHowever, talk only about features that are relevant to the story’s theme. And link them to specific challenges the reader is likely to face. \n\nSticking to only one or two features will keep readers focused on what you want them to take away. Otherwise, you risk distracting them.\n\nAlso, note that a solution can involve more than just a product’s tangible features.\n\nThe reader should know that your personalized service helped the customer’s business achieve something faster. Or that your smooth onboarding process minimized their disruption. \n\nIf someone reading your case study has experienced bad service before, this knowledge might persuade them to convert.\n\n7. Shout About the Outcome (Using Data to Illustrate)\n\nData is the best way to illustrate impact. It allows readers to tangibly compare their experiences with your customer’s.\n\nAll effective case studies have a happy ending. Explain how your customer is better off than before using your product, with real data to prove your point.\n\nWe use a lot of data in the artisan bakery SEO case study we mentioned earlier. \n\nStats appear in the text (e.g., “By that time organic traffic to the bakery website had already increased by 214%”), but we also designed an infographic to make our achievements stand out:\n\nPlus, we included more data to make our project’s outcome as tangible as possible for our readers.\n\nThese are the types of charts and graphs our audience (marketing agencies) is familiar with. The positive data in our case study is a clear demonstration of what’s possible with Semrush’s support.\n\n8. Validate Your Story with a Strong Closing Statement\n\nSummarize your results and get readers thinking about the next steps by showing where the featured client is heading now they’ve solved the problem. Don’t forget to include a call to action (CTA).\n\nInclude an individual/employee name, job title, and first-hand comments to humanize your case study content.\n\nYou can weave customer comments throughout the piece to validate or expand your points. A direct quotation is also a great way to end your case study.\n\nIf they didn’t during your interview, ask your customer to summarize your product’s and your relationship’s impact on their business.\n\nGlobal IT management platform Hofy uses a fully interview-based case study format. This final comment from its customer acts as a highly effective conclusion:\n\nImage Source: Hofy\n\nKey messages here include:\n\nHofy’s unrivaled level of service\nThe customer has no regrets\nThe customer explicitly says, “I’m happy. Everyone’s happy. The users are super happy.”\n\nAllowing your customer to conclude your case study gives readers one final reminder that this is an honest account involving a real, comparable business. \n\nIf the comment is a glowing review like Hofy’s, it could even act as a subtle CTA.\n\nUse These Three Case Study Examples for Inspiration\n\nCaptivating case studies from other businesses can provide valuable ideas for how to write a case analysis for your brand. Tips may include:\n\nSpecific case study topics to cover\nThe tone of voice you want to use\nYour case study’s visual layout\nAccompanying imagery to enhance your analysis\n\nHere are three examples of great case study content to get you started.\n\nHousehold Names: Adobe and The Home Depot\n\nAdobe carried out an in-depth case study of a highly successful customer.\n\nImage Source: Adobe\n\nThe first part alone has enough to engage and intrigue the reader:\n\nA snappy headline\nThree impressive takeaway stats\nA customer quotation and image\nA list of the products The Home Depot used\n\nIt then details all of the most important story elements in around 2,000 words. \n\nThere are quotes throughout, explanations of achievements, and some impressive outcome figures at the end.\n\nKey takeaways from this case study:\n\nReal customer headshots add a human element to your case studies\nOpening with a direct quote immediately emphasizes the customer, where your focus should be\nInternal links to product pages allow inspired readers to learn more about your offerings\nSmall-Business Success: ShipStation and The Burlap Bag\n\nShipStation appeals to its small-business audience in this case study of its work with the primarily soy candle selling store. \n\nImage Source: ShipStation\n\nIt summarizes the story using a small takeaway section on the right, allowing readers to check the relevance of this content quickly. \n\nThen, it explains the relationship in more detail using text, feel-good imagery, and embedded social media content.\n\nKey takeaways from this case study:\n\nVideo content can complement text to offer more authenticity\nYou can set the tone with your choice of imagery\nSometimes, all it takes is one impressive statistic to grab attention (“95% quicker label printing”)\nHelping Customers Help Others: Semrush, Re:signal, and Learning with Experts\n\nIn this case study, we look beyond the immediate impact of our product.
