It offers an API, but the access is still limited. \n\nBest Blogging Tools for Publishing\n\nFor people to read your blog posts, they must be publicly available. These blogging platforms let you publish content online. They also have built-in tools to help you achieve your blogging goals. \n\nWordPress\n\nWordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS). It’s used by 64.2% of all websites. \n\nThe ability to write, edit, and publish blog content within a single platform makes WordPress one of the best blogging tools for beginners. \n\nWordPress also offers advanced functionality for bloggers via its massive directory of plugins.

By offering tried-and-true templates and a streamlined dashboard, it helps you to create professional-looking graphics without a design background. \n\nAdobe Express comes with a generative AI feature called Adobe Firefly that allows you to create designs by entering a description into a field.\n\nPricing: Free and paid versions\n\nIntegrations: Adobe Express is an online editor, which means you don’t have to download an app to use it. It doesn’t integrate directly with other programs or tools.\n\nCanva\n\nCanva is a web-based graphic design platform that can create custom blog post graphics, social media posts, logos, and more. It features a drag-and-drop editing system that’s easy to learn. \n\nOne area Canva excels in is its extensive library of pre-designed templates. Users can edit and customize the text, colors, and layout of professionally created templates rather than create a design from scratch. \n\nPricing: Free and paid plans. \n\nIntegrations: Canva integrates with dozens of apps including Pexels, Google Drive, and Instagram. \n\nPexels\n\nPexels is a stock photo and video library where you can find free visual content to add to your blog. \n\nPexels is incredibly easy to use.

You’ll see dozens of results of media that match your search. \n\nImage source: Pexels\n\nOnce you find a photo or video you like, you can download it directly to your computer. \n\nPexels is packed with handy features that help you find the right media for your blog: \n\nTags: See keywords the photos you like are tagged with and explore related media\nUsers: Follow users you like (and even tip them if you want)\nCollections: Store photos you like in a personal library you can access later\n\nPricing: Free. \n\nIntegrations: Pexels integrates with several popular apps and services including Canva, WordPress, Adobe Photoshop, and more. \n\nBest Blogging Tools for Data Analysis\n\nTracking traffic to your blog can help you analyze its performance. Doing so is especially important if you rely on your blog for income. \n\nIf you want to measure your blog’s performance metrics, you need tools in place to capture various data points. \n\nThe following tools can help you track and analyze blogging metrics for success. \n\nGoogle Analytics\n\nGoogle Analytics is a service provided by Google that tracks and analyzes a website’s performance. It’s the most widely used web analytics tool on the web. \n\nMost bloggers can set up the basic functionality in just a few minutes. But it offers endless possibilities to slice and dice your web metrics for analysis. \n\nGoogle Analytics can track these important content performance metrics: \n\nOrganic traffic: How many people find your blog post via search engines\nUser engagement: User engagement is the amount of time someone spends with your web page or app\nConversions: When a reader takes a desired action (like signing up for your newsletter) after visiting your site\n\nPro tip: Semrush has a guide specifically to help beginners set up and master Google Analytics. \n\nPricing: Free. \n\nIntegrations: You can integrate Google Analytics with hundreds of digital tools like Semrush, ecommerce platforms, WordPress, and more.\n\nGoogle Search Console\n\nGoogle Search Console is a web service designed to help bloggers monitor and optimize their performance in Google's search results.\n\nGoogle Analytics measures things that happen on your blog, but Google Search Console measures what happens in Google SERPs. It provides valuable information for bloggers looking to see how their blog posts rank for particular keywords. \n\nIt’s probably easiest to explain the value of Google Search Console with an example: \n\nLet’s say you published a blog post targeting the keyword “content marketing framework.” \n\nAfter publishing and waiting for Google to index your post, pop into Google Search Console and click the “Performance” tab on the left sidebar. \n\nAdd the query “content marketing framework” to the filters above the chart. You’ll see the average ranking position of your content over time: \n\nThis insight into the performance of your content helps you try to improve its ranking. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nGoogle Search Console: The Ultimate Guide for 2024\n\nPricing: Free. \n\nIntegrations: Google Search Console connects with dozens of tools, including SEO tools like Semrush. \n\nBest Blogging Tools for Collaboration\n\nSometimes, blogging is a team sport. This is especially true for businesses that use blogging to generate marketing results. \n\nCollaboration tools help keep everyone on the same page and ensure your workflow goes as smoothly as possible. Here are a few blogging collaboration tools that can help. \n\nGoogle Docs\n\nGoogle Docs is a web-based word-processing program. \n\nIt’s extremely popular among bloggers and marketers. It’s primarily a writing tool, but we’ve listed it here to highlight its unique collaboration features. \n\nWhen you work with clients or team members, feedback is one of the most important parts of the overall process. Google Docs provides three key features that support the feedback and editing process: \n\nComments: Editors can use comments to leave feedback on specific writing sections. They can also use this feature to add context or suggestions so writers can learn and adjust accordingly. \nSuggesting: When you want to make edits without altering the original text, you can use this feature. Writers can accept or reject your suggestions, which makes the editing process more organic.\nTrack changes: For editors who prefer making direct changes to the document, Google Docs tracks and saves every change by different people in different colors. Writers can open the log to see what copy the editor has changed.\n\nAnother handy collaboration feature of Google Docs is link sharing. \n\nIf you want to share a draft with somebody, you can set permissions and send them a unique link. You can set permissions as Viewer, Commentor, or Editor. By defining permissions, Google Docs enables you to establish the appropriate level of security for your content.\n\nPricing: Free and paid plans. \n\nIntegrations: Google Docs has a massive list of integrations called add-ons you can download or purchase from the Google Workspace Marketplace. \n\nmonday.com\n\nMonday.com is a web-based project management tool that helps teams manage tasks and build customer workflows. \n\nIf you’re working with a team or just want to organize your blog workflow, monday.com can help break the content production process down into actionable steps. \n\nFor example, bloggers may want to organize their workflow chronologically: \n\nConduct keyword research\nDevelop outline\nWrite article\nDesign graphics\nPublish to WordPress\n\nWhile this is a simple example, with monday.com, you can take this idea and incorporate more complex workflows and team members to optimize productivity and maintain accountability. \n\nPricing: Free and paid plans. \n\nIntegrations: monday.com has over 200 integrations. Its Semrush integration can help prioritize your content production schedule by displaying SEO metrics directly in the monday.com dashboard. \n\nCoSchedule\n\nCoSchedule is an online tool that helps organize and enhance various forms of content, from blog posts to social media. It offers features to schedule social media content, optimize your writing, and collaborate with team members. \n\nThere are a few standout features for bloggers: \n\nSocial Calendar: Schedule and publish social media content to promote your blog posts\nContent Calendar: See all your content (blog posts, emails, social posts) laid out visually to help plan and shore up any gaps\nHeadline Studio: Get tips to write better headlines that will get more clicks and drive more traffic to your blog posts\n\nPricing: Free and paid. \n\nIntegrations: CoSchedule has robust integrations with various CRMs, email marketing platforms, and productivity tools. \n\nHow to Choose the Right Blogging Tool for You\n\nWhether blogging for SEO, building an audience, or getting subscribers for a newsletter, the right tools can make all the difference. \n\nSo how do you choose the right tool? \n\nTry this using these steps: \n\nPurpose: Define what problem you need the tool to solve. Tools like Copy.ai can help you generate more content quicker with the help of AI, while tools like Google Search Console will help you analyze the success of what you’ve already posted. \nPricing: What is your budget for software? Subscribing to too many tools can quickly put you over budget. Set a budget and only purchase tools that solve the priorities you identified in the previous step. \nIntegrations: Syncing the blogging tools you buy with your existing software will help you save time. Double-check the integration abilities of the tools you’re considering to see if they’re compatible with your software stack. \nReviews: Once you’ve narrowed your search using the steps above, check out the reviews and testimonials from sites like G2 and Capterra to see how others evaluate their experience. \n\nThe right set of blogging tools can streamline your processes, increase efficiency, and enhance the overall quality of your blog content.\n\nLevel Up Your Blogging Production and Results\n\nAchieving results with blogging requires effort, consistency, and strategy. Semrush can help you plan and execute a winning blog. \n\nIf you want to learn more about how to write a successful blog, here’s what you can read next: \n\n21 Practical and Effective Blogging Tips for Beginners\nThe Ultimate Guide to Content Marketing Strategy\nSemrush 101: Getting Started Guide + Free Checklist Download\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
