And sign into Google if necessary.\n\nThen, click “Make a copy.” \n\nThis will create and open a copy of the template in your Google Drive.\n\nNext, you’ll learn how to fill out the content marketing strategy template. Section by section.\n\n1. Set Content Goals\n\nFirst, define your general content marketing goals and how you’ll measure them.\n\nThis will give direction to the rest of your content strategy. And allow you to track your success in the future.\n\nSet goals that are SMART:\n\nS\n\n\t\n\nSpecific\n\n\t\n\nPrecise, unambiguous goals keep your efforts focused. Break down broad objectives into clearer sub-objectives.\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\t\n\nMeasurable\n\n\t\n\nTracking your progress objectively allows you to make data-led decisions. Translate obscure objectives into quantifiable ones.\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\t\n\nAttainable\n\n\t\n\nOver-ambitious goals can demotivate your team. Create realistic goals by considering your resources and referring to relevant benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\t\n\nRelevant\n\n\t\n\nContent goals should align with your broader marketing strategy. You’ll see better results when everyone works toward similar objectives.\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\t\n\nTime-bound\n\n\t\n\nMotivate your team and improve tracking by setting a deadline for each goal. But make sure you have enough time to make an impact. \n\nAccording to Semrush’s State of Content Marketing report, the most common content goals are:\n\nAttract more traffic to our website\nIncrease brand awareness\nGenerate leads\nGenerate sales/revenue\nImprove customer loyalty and engagement\n\nThe SMART version of “Attract more traffic” could be “Increase website traffic by 25% over the next six months by optimizing existing content for SEO and publishing high-quality blog posts twice a week.”\n\n(You might want to refine your goals later. Once you have more information in your strategy.)\n\nWhen you’ve decided on your goal, add it to your content strategy template. And note how you’ll measure it. For example, you might use Google Analytics 4 to measure traffic.\n\nThis process ensures that your goals are practical and clear. \n\nFurther reading\n\nContent Marketing Metrics to Track for Success\n\n2. Create Buyer Personas\n\nNext, create and summarize buyer personas (fictional profiles that represent different segments of your target audience).\n\nThis will help you understand each type of prospect—and create content they’ll love.\n\nHere’s an example of a full persona, created with the Semrush Persona tool:\n\nAnd the corresponding summary in our example content strategy:\n\nIf you haven’t created buyer personas yet (or you want to improve yours), you’ll need to conduct in-depth audience research.\n\nYou can learn about your website users’ demographics through Google Analytics. \n\nNavigate to “Reports”> “User” > “User attributes” > “Overview” to see a breakdown of your audience by country, city, gender, interests, age, and language.\n\nFor further insights, analyze your market with Semrush’s One2Target tool. \n\nSelect your target location, enter up to five competitors’ domains, then click “Analyze.”\n\nThe tool will analyze your market audience. And provide three reports with useful breakdowns:\n\nDemographics: Age, sex, and country\nSocioeconomics: Household size, income level, employment status, and education level \nBehavior: Interests, devices, and social media\n\nIn the “Audience Overlap” tab, you can see which sites these users visit most.\n\nThis can help you understand what types of content your prospects love. And identify key places for content distribution. \n\nAnalyze Your Target Audience\n\nwith Semrush’s One2Target Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Document Your Resources\n\nNext, document the resources available to you or your team.\n\nThis includes:\n\nPeople: Who are the people on your team? What are their skill sets? How much time do they have available for content projects?\nTools: What content tools do you have access to? What are their functions?\nBudget: Do you have a budget for additional resources? How much can you spend and on what?\n\nNoting this information helps you determine which projects are viable. And allocate resources more effectively.\n\nSay you fill out your content strategy template like this:\n\nThis shows that you’re well-equipped to create search-optimized blog posts. But you might struggle to create high-quality videos.\n\n4. Analyze Competitors’ Content\n\nAnalyze competitors’ content to see what’s working for them—and what isn’t. Then, keep notes to inform your own content marketing strategy. \n\nIn this context, a competitor is any site publishing similar content to yours. Commercial rivals are of particular interest. But you could also glean insights from industry bloggers, for example.\n\nTo get started, search your domain and country in Semrush’s Organic Research tool.\n\nThen, go to the “Competitors” report to find sites that share the most organic keywords with you. (Meaning their content is similar to yours.)\n\nTo learn more about a competitor, click on their domain. (This searches the domain in Organic Research.)\n\nThen, go to the “Pages” report to discover the rival’s top-performing URLs.\n\nYou’ll find the following metrics for each page:\n\nTraffic: The estimated number of unpaid visits from Google each month\nKeywords: The number of keywords the page ranks for (with a search intent breakdown)\nBacklinks: The number of links this page has from other domains (you may need to click “Show”)\n\nGenerally, the stronger these metrics, the better the content.\n\nClick the “External link” icon to visit any URL and conduct further analysis.\n\nAsk yourself the following questions. And add notes to your content strategy template.\n\nWhat type(s) of content does this competitor create?\nWhat topics does this competitor cover?\nWhich pieces of content perform best?\nWhat does this competitor do well?\nWhat could they do better?\n\nLike this:\n\nFind and Analyze Competitors\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Audit Your Content\n\nA content audit is an analysis of your existing content. You should review every page on your website and decide what to do with it:\n\nKeep: The content is helpful and performing well. So, it should be kept as-is.\nImprove: The content could be improved or is not performing as well as it could. Improving this content could be a cost-effective way to get more traffic and/or conversions.\nRemove: The content offers no value and has little to no potential. It should be removed, as it could be doing more harm than good.\n\nImplementing these changes tends to be more cost-effective than creating new content. Plus, it gives you a solid foundation to build upon.\n\nTo determine if content should be improved, ask yourself:\n\nIs the content helpful, comprehensive, and accurate?\nDoes the content demonstrate E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness)?\nDoes the topic have business potential? \nDoes your audience want or need this content?\n\nTo determine if content is performing well, ask yourself:\n\nDoes your content fulfill its original goals?\nHow much traffic does the page generate?\nHow many conversions does the page generate?\n\nMake sure to add all your notes to the content strategy template. Like this:\n\nNeed help with your audit? \n\nUse Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker.\n\nEnter the target keywords for each of your pages. The tool will provide a list of optimization ideas for each. Based on SEO best practices and analysis of top-ranking content.\n\nThese ideas can relate to content, SEO strategy, backlinks, user experience, technical SEO, SERP features, and semantic SEO.\n\nPlus, each page gets a priority score based on the number of optimization ideas, the ease of implementing these ideas, and the potential traffic gain.\n\nReview Website Content\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\n6. Identify Content Gaps\n\nContent gaps are topics your website could benefit from covering. Because they’re relevant to your audience and your brand.\n\nFilling these gaps through content creation means addressing more of your audience’s needs. So you can increase traffic, engagement, and conversions.\n\nIt also helps you build a more robust content marketing funnel. In other words, content that nurtures users at every stage of the buying journey.\n\nSo, it’s important to recognize and define these gaps. Like this:\n\nOne way to identify content gaps is with Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool. \n\nIt can show you keywords that rivals rank for—but you don’t.\n\nAnother option is the Topic Research tool. Which sources popular and trending subtopics based on your chosen topic.\n\nTo see what kind of content you’d need to create, search your keyword or topic in the Keyword Overview tool. And scroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section.\n\nThis shows you which pages are currently ranking top in your location.\n\nYou’ll need to create something similar (but better) to earn a prominent ranking.\n\n7. Establish Content Guidelines\n\nIn the final section, establish and outline your content guidelines. \n\nThese are the principles of content creation. Which help your team stay aligned and produce on-brand, goal-oriented content.\n\nStart by creating and linking to key resources, including:\n\nTone of voice guidelines: A document that defines your brand’s tone of voice. This is the personality that should come through in all your writing.\nContent calendar: A schedule detailing the content you will publish. Use our content calendar template to create yours. \nStyle guide: A document outlining your design standards. This helps you produce visual content that consistently fits your brand identity.\n\nAlso jot down key details for easy reference. Like this:\n\nNext, decide what types of content marketing you want to engage in. And build out the guidelines for each. Making sure to reference all the information in your content strategy template so far.\n\nFormat: The type of content (blog post, video, ebook, etc.). Consider your buyer personas, resources, etc.\nTopics: The topics you want your content to cover. These should be relevant to your brand, interesting to your audience, and compatible with your chosen format.\nFrequency: How often do you want to create and publish this type of content? Consider your available resources. And remember that quality trumps quantity.\nDistribution: How will you amplify your content to get more people to see it? You can distribute content via social media, email newsletters, etc.\nNotes: Anything else that’s important to note. For example, the main purpose of the content.\n\nHere’s a snapshot from our content strategy example:\n\nHow to Customize and Share Your Document\n\nTo rename your website content strategy template:\n\nClick the current title in the top-left corner\nType in your preferred title \nHit Enter/Return on your keyboard\n\nTo duplicate a table:\n\nUse your mouse to highlight the entire table\nRight-click your mouse and click “Copy”\nPlace your cursor where you’d like to add the table, then right-click and select “Paste”\n\nTo add table rows or columns: \n\nPlace your cursor next to the desired location for the row/column\nRight-click your mouse and click “Insert row above,” “Insert row below,” “Insert column left,” or “Insert column right” \n\nTo change table colors:\n\nHighlight the cells you’d like to change\nClick the paint can icon in the toolbar\nSelect your preferred color\n\nTo move your document to another folder: \n\nClick the arrow folder icon at the top\nChoose your preferred location in your Google Drive\nSelect “Move”\n\nTo export your document: \n\nClick “File” > “Download”\nSelect your preferred file format\nThe file will save to the default location on your device\n\nTo share your document: \n\nClick the “Share” button in the upper-right corner\nAdd specific people and/or enable general access\nChoose Viewer/Commenter/Editor permission as required\n\nTip\n\nStrengthen your marketing strategy further with our SEO strategy template and social media strategy template.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe next step is using your content strategy to create a content plan—a document that outlines specific tasks for the coming weeks or months.\n\nYou can then start creating. And monitoring your content’s success.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, we recommend refreshing your content strategy document every six months. Or whenever there’s a major change to your business or market.\n\nThis allows enough time to see the real impact of your efforts. While giving you the opportunity to adapt to results and important changes.\n\nElevate Your Content Strategy\n\nwith Semrush’s SEO Tools\n\nSign Up Free →",
