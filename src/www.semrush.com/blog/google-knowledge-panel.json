  "content": "What Is a Google Knowledge Panel?\n\nA Google knowledge panel is a type of rich result that appears on the right side of the SERPs when people search for an entity, such as a person, place, organization, or thing. It provides a summary of information about the entity based on Google’s understanding of the topic and can include facts, images, links, and other relevant details to help users learn more. \n\nHere’s what a knowledge panel looks like:\n\nGoogle Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) boxes are not knowledge panels. They are business listings that contain information provided by the businesses. \n\nLike this:\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhat Are SERP Features?

Knowledge panels appear on the right side of the search results, which means they can attract more attention and clicks from users. They also show that Google recognizes your entity as relevant and trustworthy for the query\nEnhance your brand image and reputation. Knowledge panels can showcase your logo, social media profiles, website, and other information that can help users learn more about you and your business. They can also feature reviews, ratings, awards, and other positive signals that can boost your credibility and reputation\nDrive more traffic and conversions to your website. Knowledge panels can include direct links to your website, products, services, events, and other pages that can generate more traffic and leads for your business. They can also display rich snippets, such as FAQs, how-to guides, videos, and images, that can provide more value to users and increase their engagement\n\nNote: You can quickly see if any keywords trigger knowledge panels with the Keyword Magic tool’s advanced filters. \n\nFind Keywords That Trigger Knowledge Panels\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nHow Does Google Generate Knowledge Panels?\n\nKnowledge panels are automatically generated and powered by information from Google’s Knowledge Graph (a database of millions of facts). \n\nGoogle has amassed these facts from materials shared across the web. And from databases like Wikipedia, Wikidata, Crunchbase, and LinkedIn.\n\nGoogle has a patent that talks specifically about knowledge panels. And it mentions the methodology for generating them. \n\nThe overall process is complex, but we can simplify it into four simple steps.\n\nWhen a user searches for an entity, Google can do the following:\n\nIdentify entities in the search query\nSelect a knowledge panel template that matches the entity type\nFill in placeholders in the knowledge panel template\nMerge search results and the knowledge panel in SERPs\n\nImages can also appear in knowledge panels, and Google picks them from different resources. \n\nFor example, individuals who have claimed their knowledge panels can select a featured image. \n\nImages for other entities are a preview of Google Images results for the entity and are automatically sourced from across the web. \n\nLike this:\n\nKnowledge panels also update automatically. They can do so as information changes, directly from the entity in the panel, or from general user feedback. \n\nIf you (or your business) are an entity in a knowledge panel, you can claim the knowledge panel and suggest changes. \n\nHow to Get a Google Knowledge Panel \n\nYou can’t directly apply for a knowledge panel. But you can do certain things to make it more likely for one to appear. \n\nPick a Primary Entity Home Page\n\nThe first step is identifying the primary page that describes your entity. Some call this the “entity home” or “entity home page.” \n\nIt’s simply the page where the entity “lives” in Google’s view. And where Google can go for information about you or the company.\n\nThe entity’s home can be any page—as long as it only talks about you or the company. \n\nAn SEO recommendation is to have your entity home page on a dedicated “about” page rather than the homepage.\n\nYou also want that page on your site where you can control the information. \n\nMany sites will recommend creating a Wikipedia page. \n\nHaving a Wikipedia page can be great for your business for many reasons. But you don’t want to have your entity home page on a site you don’t completely control.\n\nIf you do, your knowledge panel will always be flaky, prone to errors, and liable to disappear.\n\nState as Many Facts as You Can\n\nOn the entity home page, state the facts you want Google to understand.\n\nUse multiple sections with simple descriptions and helpful, factual information. \n\nAnd add links to sources that talk about you or your company. The more trustworthy the source, the better. \n\nThen, add organization Schema.org markup (structured data vocabulary) to convey that same information in Google’s “native language.” \n\nLike this:\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">{\"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"Corporation\", \"name\": \"Semrush\", \"description\": \"Semrush - online visibility management and content marketing SaaS platform\", \"logo\": \"https://cdn.semrush.com/__static__/semrush-logo-700.jpg\", \"email\": \"mailto:mail@semrush.com\", \"telephone\": \"+1-800-815-9959\", \"url\": \"https://www.semrush.com/\", }</script>\n\nYou’re just reiterating what you say on the page in a way Google can easily digest. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nOrganization Schema: What It Is & How to Implement It\nCorroborate the Facts\n\nIn this final step, your goal is to ensure the links you include in your entity home page contain factual information. \n\nThe content on each of those links should corroborate exactly what you say. Each page should have the same (or similar) descriptions of you or your business. \n\nThe key is consistency. \n\nThe more Google sees the same information on sources they trust, the more confidence they have that the information is accurate. \n\nBetter still, if every page you link to links back to the entity home, you create an infinite loop of self-confirming information with the page you control. \n\nHow to Claim a Google Knowledge Panel\n\nIf you see a knowledge panel for your entity, you can claim it by getting verified on Google. \n\nHere’s how:\n\nGet Verified on Google\n\nStart by going to Google and searching for yourself or the entity you represent. \n\nOnce you see the knowledge panel, click “Claim this knowledge panel” at the bottom. \n\nIf you’re on a mobile device, locate the “About” section and tap “Claim this knowledge panel.” \n\nLike this:\n\nThen, sign in to one of the official sites or social profiles listed for the entity.\n\nFor example, you can sign into YouTube, Google Search Console, Twitter, or Facebook. \n\nYou'll be asked to provide additional information if Google can’t identify your entity home—like a government-issued ID or proof of your legal relationship with the entity. \n\nAdd Users and Authorized Representatives\n\nOnce you’re verified, you can add other users as authorized representatives. \n\nStart by going to the “Manage users” page and clicking “Start now” under “Add people to this account.”\n\nThen, click “Add new user.” Enter the new user’s Gmail address. \n\nNow, toggle the different levels to grant the new user’s permissions—for example, Manager, Owner, or Contributor. \n\nClick “Invite,” and you’re all set.\n\nManage User Permissions\n\nYou (or any account manager) can remove or change a user’s permissions. \n\nTo do this, go to the “Manage users” page again and click “Start now.” \n\nThen, click the “Menu” icon next to the user’s name you want to manage. \n\nAnd select an option like “Remove as manager,” “Remove user,” or “Transfer ownership.” \n\nGet a team account\n\nTo save on Semrush subscription\n\nLearn more →\nHow to Edit Your Google Knowledge Panel\n\nKnowledge panels are generated automatically and can’t be edited directly. What you can do, as a verified entity, is suggest changes. \n\nYou can suggest changes to:\n\nFeatured images\nTitles\nSubtitles\nDescriptions\nSocial media profiles\n\nAnd others.\n\nTo suggest a change, go to Google, search for the entity, and find the knowledge panel. \n\nThen, click “Suggest edits” above the title. \n\nNote: If you don’t see this option, you either haven’t been verified by Google or are signed in with a different account. \n\nThen, click on the information you want to suggest changes for. \n\nLike so:\n\nNote: If you have more than one suggested edit, submit feedback for each separately. \n\nNow, in the pop-up box, enter a short description, including the following:\n\nYour suggested change\nWhy you believe Google should implement the change\nIf possible, a URL that confirms your changes\n\nThen, click “Send.” \n\nNote: Anyone can suggest edits to a knowledge panel through the “Feedback” link at the bottom of the panel. \n\nWhy Do Knowledge Panels Disappear?\n\nGoogle knowledge panels can disappear for a number of reasons. \n\nLet’s explore each one. \n\nKnowledge Graph Update\n\nGoogle updates the Knowledge Graph periodically. When they do, there’s a shake-up of information they accept as fact and, thus, a shake-up of knowledge panels. \n\nThese updates are dangerous if your entity lacks an entity home and sufficient corroboration. \n\nYou can use this Knowledge Graph sensor to track data refreshes and algorithm updates. \n\nYou Lose Your Entity Home\n\nWhether Google has recognized your entity home or not, they usually use a “foundation” source as a crutch ( i.e., Wikipedia, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.). \n\nIf Google loses that reference for any reason, it may drop the knowledge panel. \n\nFor example, if Google relied on your Wikipedia article, and your Wikipedia article is deleted, you may lose the knowledge panel. \n\nOr if your “About” page suddenly disappears. Or if Google was relying on your Twitter account and you closed it.\n\nYou can lose your knowledge panel in any of those cases. \n\nHuman Intervention\n\nGoogle employees will sometimes delete knowledge panels. This can happen when the Google panel is perceived as untruthful, a duplicate, or spam. \n\nThe first two are straightforward, so let’s talk about knowledge panel spam. \n\nKnowledge panel spam is when people trigger and manage knowledge panels with techniques that don’t comply with Google’s guidelines. \n\nExamples of knowledge panel spam can include paid pseudo-Wikis, self-created fandom sites, and mass press releases. \n\nThere are more, but the rule of thumb is, “if you pay for it and it is quick and easy, it is probably spam.”\n\nTrack Keywords That Trigger the Knowledge Panel\n\nAn SEO best practice is to track keywords that trigger SERP features, like the knowledge panel. \n\nOne way to do that is to plug your URL into a tool like Organic Research and head to the “Positions” tab. \n\nThen, click the “SERP features” drop-down, hover over “Domain ranks,” and then click “Knowledge panel.”\n\nLike this:\n\nThese are all the keywords for which your domain shows up in the Google knowledge panel. \n\nNow, add these keywords to a keyword list. \n\nSelect them all and click the “Add to keyword list” button. \n\nNow, select “Create new empty list” and give your list a name. Perhaps something like “Knowledge Panel.”\n\nYou can then find your new list in Keyword Strategy Builder. \n\nOpen the tool, click on your list, and you’ll see detailed information about each keyword. \n\nIncluding monthly search volume, search trends, other SERP features, and more.\n\nLike so:\n\nYou can also add other keywords to this list. \n\nFor example, if not already on your list, we recommend adding keywords like “[Brand],” “about [Brand],” and “what is [Brand].” \n\nThese tend to also trigger knowledge panels.\n\nTo do so, click the “Add keywords” button.\n\nThen, add your keywords separated by commas or one per line. And click “Add keywords.”\n\nKeep an eye on the keywords on this list and make sure they keep triggering your knowledge panel. \n\nClick on the “SERP features” drop-down, select “Knowledge panel,” and click “Apply.” \n\nAll your keywords should still show. \n\nIf they don’t, take a look at your entity home and corroborative sources to see if anything has changed. \n\nAnd adjust accordingly. \n\nThis post was updated in 2023.
