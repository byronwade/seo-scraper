  "content": "SEO vs. CRO: How Are They Related?\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) and conversion rate optimization (CRO) focus on different website elements. But they are closely related. \n\nSEO: A set of practices meant to increase a website’s visibility in search engines. And boost organic traffic.\nCRO: The process of optimizing a website to increase the percentage of visitors who take a desired action. Like clicking “add to cart” or filling out a form. \n\nThese strategies can work together to foster business growth.\n\nSEO focuses on elements that impact organic rankings. Like keywords and meta tags. CRO focuses on elements the user might engage with. Like calls to action (CTAs) and submission forms. \n\nThe Basics of SEO: Driving Quality Traffic\n\nThe main goal of SEO is to drive quality traffic from search engines to your website. This means website visitors who are interested in the products or services you offer.\n\nThere are three primary subcategories of SEO: \n\nOn-page SEO: Optimizing the content of a webpage. Such as landing page copy or meta tags.\nOff-page SEO: Increasing off-page signals. Like backlinks, brand mentions, or social media profiles. \nTechnical SEO: Improving the performance of a website. Like page speed and load times.\n\nNote\n\nWhen it comes to aligning SEO and CRO, most of the tips below focus on technical and on-page SEO. Because they’re the most likely to impact whether visitors convert.\n\nThe Basics of CRO: Maximizing Conversions\n\nThe primary goal of CRO is to increase your conversion rate. Or the percentage of total visitors who take a desired action on your website.\n\nThe formula for conversion rate looks like this:\n\nCRO is executed by studying behaviors on a website. Like clicks or scroll depth. Then, adding or changing website elements. To encourage more users to take the desired action. \n\nThere are many types of conversion actions, such as:\n\nSubmitting a form\nPurchasing a product\nBooking a meeting\nCreating an account\nSubscribing to a newsletter\n\nOften, different pages of your website will have different conversion goals.\n\nFor example, the conversion goal of a product page may be for the user to add an item to a shopping cart. \n\nLike this:\n\nThe conversion goal of a blog post may be to get more email subscribers. \n\nLike this:\n\nTo increase conversion rates, clearly define what conversion actions you want to generate on specific webpages. \n\nThen, apply CRO strategies to encourage more of those actions. \n\nFurther reading: The Art of Content Optimization: The Complete Guide\n\n9 Ways to Combine SEO and CRO \n\nEnsure your efforts support each other by integrating SEO and CRO. \n\n1. Align SEO Goals with CRO Goals\n\nAlign SEO and CRO goals in your marketing strategy. So you are more likely to increase organic traffic. And conversion rates.\n\nLet’s say you removed a meeting-booking widget on one of your webpages because it was increasing page load time. \n\nThat may help SEO by improving page speed, but it will probably reduce the conversion rate of the page. \n\nSo, it’s important to discuss your SEO and CRO strategies simultaneously. \n\nConsider asking the following questions in the planning stage:\n\nWhere in the marketing funnel is my organic website visitor?\nWhat conversion action are they most likely to take?\nDoes the content on the page encourage them to take that specific action?\nCan I add design elements to encourage that action?\nWill changing or adding those design elements impact the SEO performance of the page?\n\nAnswering these questions can help you avoid conflicts between SEO and CRO.\n\nAnd help you combine both strategies into a cohesive marketing approach.\n\n2. Optimize for Keyword Search Intent\n\nSearch intent refers to the true intent behind a user’s search. Or what they are looking for when using a keyword.\n\nMarketers use four primary search intent categories: \n\nNavigational: When the user is looking for a specific website or webpage\nInformational: When the user is looking for specific information\nCommercial: When the user is researching a product or service. But may not be ready to make a purchase.\nTransactional: When the user is looking to make a purchase or otherwise convert\n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool to understand the search intent of keywords. \n\nYou’ll find it under SEO > Keyword Research > Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nStart by entering a keyword into the text box. Select your target regional location. Then, click “Search.”\n\nWhen the table populates, look at the column labeled “Intent.” The letter displayed will signify the search intent of the keyword.\n\nSearch intent has a close relationship to CRO. Because it can reveal the conversion actions organic visitors are most likely to take. \n\nLet’s say you have a CRO goal to increase bookings on your dog boarding website.\n\nThe keyword “dog boarding denver” has commercial intent. Those users are likely in the research phase. And may not be ready to book a reservation right away.\n\nBut the keyword “best boarding for dogs near me” has transactional intent. People using that keyword are closer to a purchase decision. And may be more willing to book a service.\n\n“Best boarding for dogs near me” is a strategic SEO choice that could also benefit CRO.\n\nKnowing how to optimize content for CRO in SEO can help you align goals. Which can lead to better results with both strategies.\n\nPerform Keyword Research for SEO and CRO\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Create High-Quality, SEO-Friendly Content\n\nHigh-quality content has a better chance of ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). Which can lead to more traffic. And more opportunities to convert.\n\nBut if an organic visitor does not find your content relevant or helpful, they may click back to the SERP. Before taking any conversion action on your website.\n\nSo, creating high-quality content is crucial for both SEO and CRO. But what does high-quality content look like? \n\nGoogle suggests that the following factors may indicate high-quality content:\n\nOriginal information, research, reporting, or insights\nDetailed exploration of a topic\nInsightful analysis (does more than state the obvious)\nProvides substantial value compared to other pages in the SERPs\nFree from misspellings and grammatical errors\n\nIf you need help creating high-quality content, use the SEO Content Template. This brief creation tool provides helpful suggestions. Like keyword, length, and content recommendations.\n\nYou’ll find the SEO Content Template in Semrush under “Content Marketing” > “SEO Content Template.” \n\nEnter a keyword and target location. Then, click “Create content template.”\n\nScroll down to the “Key recommendations” section. The terms listed in “Semantically related words” are topics you can explore on your webpage. \n\nYou’ll also see other recommendations in the template for word count, page titles, and more.\n\nUsing SEO Content Template can help you create content that is highly relevant to the user’s search intent.\n\nWhich can lead to reaching an audience that is motivated to convert.\n\n4. Focus on Title Tags and Meta Descriptions\n\nWell-crafted title tags and meta descriptions can increase clicks from organic search engines. And encourage conversions.\n\nThe title tag of a webpage often appears as the blue, clickable hyperlink in the SERP. The meta description can appear below it. And both provide more information about the content.\n\nFor example, let’s continue our example of increasing doggy day care bookings.\n\nThe title tag and meta description above were optimized for SEO and CRO. \n\nThe meta description contains important keywords like “dog boarding” and “day care” for SEO. But it also encourages the user to take a specific conversion action with the text, “Book today!”\n\nFollow these metadata best practices:\n\nOptimize for search intent\nFollow SEO-friendly character counts (50 to 60 for title tags; 105 characters for meta descriptions)\nInclude keywords or keyword variations\nEncourage the user to click over to the page by describing the value or relevance of the content\nAdd enticing information like discounts, promotions, or perks (e.g., “Free Shipping”)\n5. Use Calls to Action \n\nA call to action refers to any text that encourages website visitors to complete an action. \n\nFor example, the following homepage uses several CTAs on the page:\n\nThe CTAs include:\n\n“Book Today”\n“Call us”\n“Learn more”\n“Click Here to Chat Now!”\n\nEach of these CTAs provides a different way for the user to take action. \n\nIf the visitor has transactional search intent, they can book a reservation. If they have informational search intent, they can chat with a sales representative. To get answers to their questions.\n\nCRO strategies often involve adding CTAs. Including text, placement, and color. To give the website visitor more ways to act.\n\nOptimize CTAs for CRO and SEO with these best practices: \n\nUse large and legible text\nInclude action words (Book, Call, Subscribe, Click, etc.)\nUse a high-contrast color to make your button stand out\nInclude keywords or keyword variations (when natural)\nPlace CTAs above the fold (the upper half of a webpage)\nUse interactive elements (increase size, change color, etc.)\n6. Harness the Power of Social Proof and Testimonials\n\nReviews and testimonials can be powerful for both SEO and CRO. \n\nBecause most people read customer reviews before making a purchase decision. And they can act as a signal of trustworthiness, which Google has stated is an important indicator of content quality.\n\nIf you have positive reviews or customer testimonials, consider adding them to your website content.\n\nFor local businesses, encourage customers to leave reviews on third-party platforms. So your local listing displays a higher star rating.\n\nFor B2B companies, customer testimonials can showcase customer satisfaction. And your unique value proposition (UVP). \n\nLike this testimonial on BambooHR’s site. The customer says the software frees them up to do “more of what actually matters in HR.” It’s a compelling endorsement that speaks to the product’s value. \n\nOther ways to showcase reviews include:\n\nAdding review schema markup to your webpages\nCreating a “Reviews” page on your website\nAdding customer testimonials to the header or footer of your website\nAdding reviews to the content of certain pages or posts\n\nThe more positive reviews you get, the more you can leverage them in your SEO and CRO strategy. \n\nBut as you get more reviews, you’ll need a way to manage them. \n\nUse the Review Management tool to track online reviews. And manage your reputation. Read, reply to, and analyze reviews all in one place. \n\nMonitor Online Reviews for Your SEO and CRO Strategy\n\nwith the Review Management Tool\n\nGet Free Report →\n7. Try A/B Testing \n\nA/B testing is the process of testing two versions of a page. To see which returns better results.\n\nTo run an A/B test, you’ll need to:\n\nCreate two separate versions of a page\nChange a single variable on one of the pages\nShow both pages to the same-sized audience\nMeasure which performed better after a specific time period\n\nConduct A/B testing for both SEO and CRO purposes.\n\nFor example, test whether a page with reviews schema markup drives more traffic than one without. Or test whether a page with a green CTA button gets more conversions than a page with a red one.\n\nA/B tests like these can provide data-driven insights into which SEO optimizations or CRO elements have the greatest impact.\n\nSo you can turn more leads into customers. \n\n8. Enhance Site Speed for Better User Experience\n\nSlow-loading webpages can impede both SEO and CRO. Because visitors are less likely to stay on your website if it takes too long to load.\n\nA slow website can also negatively impact your organic web traffic. Because Google uses a page’s Core Web Vitals as one of many factors that can affect rankings. Core Web Vitals include metrics about a page’s load time and performance.\n\nTo check your website’s speed and overall performance, use Site Audit.\n\nNavigate to Semrush. You’ll find the tool under “SEO” > “On Page & Tech SEO” > “Site Audit.”\n\nStart by entering your homepage URL. Then, click “Start Audit.”\n\nNext, you’ll be prompted to select settings for your audit. \n\nPro tip\n\nThe number of pages you can check with Site Audit depends on your Semrush subscription level: \n\nPro users can crawl up to 100,000 pages per month and 20,000 pages per audit\nGuru users can crawl 300,000 pages per month and 20,000 pages per audit\nBusiness users can crawl up to 1 million pages per month and 100,000 pages per audit\n\nOnce you’ve selected your settings, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nWhen the audit is ready, locate the “Site Performance” report. You’ll find it under the Thematic Reports” table. Click “View details.”\n\nThe audit will show you a list of performance issues identified on your site. \n\nThey will be grouped in the following categories:\n\nErrors: The most severe issues on your site. These are important to resolve as soon as possible.\nWarnings: Issues with medium severity. You can focus on these after resolving errors. \nNotices: The least severe issues. They don’t impact your Site Health score, but they can be useful to fix. \n\nTo learn more about an issue, click “Learn more.” Then, follow the instructions in the “How to fix it” box.\n\nMake the recommended changes to your website. To improve page speed and other issues. \n\nRerun the Site Audit tool to confirm the impact of your changes. Or schedule weekly automated audits. \n\nFind and Fix Website Performance Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n9. Leverage Analytics \n\nBoth SEO and CRO are data-driven strategies. This means they leverage your website analytics for strategic decision-making.\n\nAnalytics platforms like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can give you insights into important SEO metrics. \n\nSuch as:\n\nOrganic clicks\nOrganic impressions\nClick-through-rates (CTRs)\nAverage ranking position\n\nThese platforms can also help you understand user behavior. For example, Google Analytics Event Tracking lets you track conversion events. Like page views and transactions.\n\nFor deeper insights, connect your Google Analytics account with the On Page SEO Checker.\n\nOpen the tool in Semrush. Then, create a project and run a report. You’ll see an overview of the ideas the tool generates under “Total Ideas.”\n\nTo the right of the “User Experience Ideas” text, you’ll see a “Connect” button.\n\nClick on “Connect” to start the process of connecting your Google Analytics account with the tool.\n\nNow, you’ll get targeted user experience recommendations based on your current website data. \n\nUse the report to get suggestions for SEO improvements as well. Click on the “Content,” “Strategy,” and “Semantic” ideas categories to review them in detail. \n\nAlign SEO and CRO for Business Growth \n\nGetting leads to your website is only half the battle. Knowing how to convert them is essential to long-term business growth. \n\nCombine SEO and CRO for the best results. \n\nThese tools can help: \n\nKeyword Magic Tool to find keywords and their search intent\nSEO Content Template to create higher-quality content\nReview Management to manage online reviews\nSite Audit to diagnose site speed and performance issues\nOn Page SEO Checker to refine your SEO/CRO strategy using analytics\n\nElevate Your SEO and CRO Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
