  "content": "Today’s consumers expect you to meet them where they are—that’s where an omnichannel approach comes in.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explain what an omnichannel strategy is and share five steps for creating a unified customer experience.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nWhat Is Omnichannel?\n\nOmnichannel is an approach to customer engagement that integrates all communication channels to create a unified experience.\n\nIf you’re wondering what omnichannel means, literally, it’s helpful to know that “omni” means “all.” And “channel” refers to any touchpoint between a brand and customer, as illustrated below.\n\nWhat does this look like in practice?\n\nSay a consumer sees an ad for a dress on their mobile device. They then look at photos of other people wearing it on social media and grab a discount code before deciding to buy. \n\nBut another person may prefer to do some research on their laptop and later try the dress on in a physical store. Then, they might ask customer support a question on the brand’s app before purchasing.\n\nAll of these separate touchpoints work together to ensure customer interactions are connected and consistent. They provide a seamless experience to boost customer satisfaction.\n\nThis is why an omnichannel strategy is so important.\n\nWhile many people think of omnichannel marketing specifically, an omnichannel approach spans marketing, sales, and customer support. \n\nIt encompasses both online channels (including your website, social media platforms, app, email, and live chat) and offline channels (things like retail stores, in-person events, and call centers).\n\nAll of your touchpoints should be consistent and complementary—no matter where customers find them—and guide each person to their destination.\n\nOmnichannel vs. Multichannel\n\nAn omnichannel approach integrates all channels seamlessly. \n\nThere’s one cohesive experience for customers—no matter how they’re reaching out. And all touchpoints are connected to guide customers throughout their journeys. \n\nIn a multichannel approach, users can interact with your business via multiple channels.\n\nBut those channels are disconnected and conversations become siloed. They’re unable to reference other interactions on other channels.\n\nHere’s what each looks like:\n\nLet’s say you own a coffee shop that uses an in-store mobile app, email marketing, Facebook, and Instagram. Customers can contact you via each of those channels. \n\nIf you have a multichannel approach, you need to manage conversations with the same customers separately.\n\nBut if you have an omnichannel approach, customers can navigate between all of these channels and pick up the same conversation with different employees.\n\nLet’s look at the advantages of this approach in more detail.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Omnichannel Experiences?\n\nThese are three of the main benefits of omnichannel experiences:\n\nHelps with Customer Acquisition and Retention\n\nAn omnichannel approach helps you more easily attract new customers. And keep them coming back.\n\nAccording to this study, four factors have the biggest impact on customer retention and acquisition—trust, commitment, communication, and conflict handling. \n\nEach of these is a natural byproduct of a well-organized omnichannel strategy. It shows customers that you’re with them every step of the way. And that you’re ready to pick up where they left off with their last interaction. \n\nAnd it could be the reason customers stick with you instead of shopping around.\n\nPositions Employees to Deliver an Exceptional Customer Experience\n\nSetting up omnichannel communication ensures your employees have the right resources to make their jobs easier. \n\nSeamless connection means employees are prepared for every interaction because they all see the same up-to-date information.\n\nAnd being able to access all customer interactions from any channel helps employees meet high customer expectations with confidence. \n\nBuilds Long-Term Customer Relationships\n\nBuilding relationships with your customers doesn’t only encourage loyalty. It also results in higher customer lifetime value—the total revenue a single customer can bring a business.\n\nOmnichannel helps create excellent experiences and long-term relationships. And research shows this makes customers more willing to:\n\nRecommend your company on social media (83%)\nBuy more products and services from you (89%)\nGo out of their way to purchase from your brand (82%)\n\nAs well as increased revenue, this loyalty results in positive word-of-mouth marketing. \n\nHappy customers become ambassadors, providing reviews and recommendations that strengthen their own and other customers’ commitment to your brand.\n\n5 Steps for a Successful Omnichannel Strategy\n\nBecoming omnichannel means implementing strategies and modern technology to deal with ever-changing customer needs.\n\nHere are the five most important steps for a successful omnichannel strategy:\n\n1. Research Which Channels Your Audience Uses\n\nStart by finding out where and how your customers want to interact with your brand. Knowing (and engaging via) your customers’ preferred channels will position you to engage with them more.\n\nThis takes some research. But you can use Google Analytics to see which channels direct traffic to your site and which channels lead to conversions.\n\nIf social media is a big part of your engagement strategy, you can analyze how those channels perform with Semrush Social.\n\nGo to Social Analytics and connect your profiles. \n\nFirst, navigate to the “Facebook” tab. Where you can see a detailed breakdown of your audience, your top posts, and more.\n\nRepeat this for Instagram and LinkedIn.\n\nIt’ll give you a better understanding of who your audience is and how they engage on specific platforms.\n\nTrack Your Social Profiles\n\nwith the Semrush Social\n\nSign up Now →\n2. Map the Customer Journey\n\nCustomer journey mapping helps you understand how customers go from first touchpoint to purchase. And allows you to align your goals more closely with your prospects and buyers.\n\nYou can use your marketing funnel as a model to map out all the pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase stages and channels your audience goes through.\n\nThe marketing funnel represents the buying stages people go through after discovering a business. It includes four main stages:\n\nAwareness\nConsideration\nConversion\nLoyalty\n\nConsider the channels people use to learn about your product, make purchases, and contact customer support. Then, ask where they might be experiencing friction with your brand.\n\nFor example, you may find your website has a good flow but makes it hard to buy on the final page.\n\nWrite all of these touchpoints and observations down on a whiteboard or sticky notes to visualize the full journey. Then, identify any gaps and consider how you could bridge them. \n\nMapping and tweaking your customer journey as behaviors and technology change is the basis of any successful omnichannel strategy.\n\nBy understanding how every single channel plays a part, you can create one seamless user experience that moves at each person’s chosen pace.\n\n3. Integrate Your Channels\n\nOnce you know which channels are important to moving customers through their journey, make sure those channels are integrated at every step. To ensure that omnichannel communication is actually possible. \n\nAsk yourself these three questions:\n\nHow can your chosen channels all communicate with each other seamlessly? \nWill you use one platform or multiple tools that work together?\nWhat platforms need automation to make omnichannel work? \n\nFor truly unified and personalized experiences that people love, you need to centralize your customer data. \n\nThat means using real-time customer relationship management (CRM) software to integrate with each channel you’re using. \n\nCRM software can integrate with email, social media, phone, and SMS, and more. That means it can help you manage and coordinate interactions across various channels.\n\nFor instance, say a customer starts an interaction on live chat. The centralized database will track their information. \n\nIf they return via phone call, the employee who answers will be able to see their information so the customer can seamlessly continue their interaction without having to repeat information.\n\n4. Develop Consistent Messaging\n\nAll of your omnichannel efforts should involve a consistent, easily identifiable brand voice. This helps increase trust with your audience.\n\nHere’s how Starbucks gets its functional and expressive tone across on various channels:\n\nWherever customers find the brand, they experience the same brand voice.\n\nYou’ll want to do this for your company as well.\n\nLet’s say customers often ask your support agents how best to use your products. You can use the same messaging they leverage in their one-on-one interactions on your social media accounts to reach an even wider audience. \n\nWe use our Instagram account to do just that:\n\nAnd make it easy for all key stakeholders to stay on the same page in terms of brand voice. This could be web designers, digital marketing specialists, support agents, copywriters, etc.\n\n5. Measure the Results\n\nOnce you’ve established your channels and are using consistent messaging across all of them, you should measure your results. To establish benchmarks and see what’s working and where there’s room for improvement. \n\nTo figure out the most effective parts of your omnichannel strategy, measure metrics like:\n\nCustomer retention rate: Shows how well your omnichannel efforts are retaining customers over time. A higher retention rate indicates that customers are finding value and consistency across channels.\nCustomer lifetime value (CLV): Indicates the long-term value of customers who engage with your brand across multiple channels. A higher CLV suggests that your omnichannel strategy is nurturing valuable, long-lasting relationships.\nCustomer satisfaction (CSAT): Lets you know how happy customers are with your brand by gathering feedback from customers across channels and calculating the percentage of those who are satisfied\nNet promoter score (NPS): Measures loyalty by asking customers how likely they are to recommend your brand\nConversion rate by channel: Shows which channels most effectively leading to customers taking your desired action. Use it to determine where to put your resources going forward.\nChannel-specific engagement metrics: Reveals which channels are more effective at driving customer engagement. For instance, monitor engagement metrics like reactions, shares, comments, and click-through rates on social media.\n\nThese are just some ideas. The metrics you choose to track should be tailored to your specific goals and industry. \n\n6. Leverage Data to Make Improvements\n\nOnce you’ve gathered data around your omnichannel approach, use it to regularly analyze and adapt your approach. \n\nTaking insight-based actions will help you continually improve your omnichannel strategy and enhance the customer experience.\n\nFor instance, you may use the data around online engagement to create a more unified retail strategy. \n\nBeauty brand Sephora did just that to create a cohesive shopping experience.\n\nWhen Sephora learned that online customer engagement was driving its in-store sales, it implemented these tactics to create make the experience more seamless:\n\nPersonalized mobile push notifications with rewards\nOnline quizzes that use the answers to personalize recommendations further\nAn in-store companion that lets customers check local stock levels in real-time\nChatbots that book in-store makeovers\nIn-store technology that matches a customer’s skin tone with related products\n\nBecause of this omnichannel success, the brand’s parent company (LVMH) reported revenue growth of 23% from 2021 to 2022. \n\nOmnichannel Examples\nTarget \n\nTarget’s seamless connection between its brick-and-mortar store and ecommerce experiences provides a great example of omnichannel retailing. \n\nKnowing many of its customers engage in online shopping, Target offers customers different fulfillment options depending on what suits them.\n\nThis includes:\n\nIn-store pickup\nDrive-up collection at the store\nFree two-day shipping\nPaid same-day delivery\n\nThese options connect every channel customers use to browse, purchase, and receive its products. \n\nThough they all happen separately, the connection makes these steps feel like a unified shopping experience. \n\nStarbucks\n\nStarbucks is one of the most-cited success stories for omnichannel marketing campaigns and retail experience because of its data use.\n\nIt also has one of the most downloaded restaurant apps with a hyper-personalized AI algorithm that can send customers unique offers.\n\nWith the Starbucks Rewards app, customers can order in advance but choose to pay in-store.\n\nAnd customers can even get recommendations for similar beverages based on previous orders, local inventory levels, and the weather.\n\nAre You Ready to Offer Omnichannel?\n\nDon’t take on too much too soon when building your omnichannel strategy. For it to be truly successful, it’s important to go through each step slowly.\n\nStart with research to make sure you won’t be putting time and money into channels your target audience doesn’t care about.\n\nThen, choose the technology to make it happen.",
