  "content": "A well-crafted marketing report can be an extremely valuable asset for you and your team. \n\nIt can help determine whether your campaigns are performing well. Or if you need to refine your marketing strategy. \n\nWe’ve put together nine marketing report templates for your daily, weekly, and monthly reporting. And you can copy or download them all. For free. \n\nLet’s get to it. \n\nWhat Is a Marketing Report?\n\nA marketing report is a collection of data from multiple sources—like social media, SEO, PR, and more. \n\nAnd it helps measure how your marketing efforts have performed against a set of goals and key performance indicators (KPIs). \n\nThey can cover different periods: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and even annually. \n\nYou can find tons of free, ready-to-use marketing report templates in Semrush’s My Reports. \n\nGeneral Marketing Reports\nDaily Marketing Report\n\nDaily reports are typically for internal purposes. Especially when it comes to agencies. \n\nThe main goal of the daily marketing report is to spot changes or threats as soon as possible. And react immediately.\n\nA daily marketing report allows you to find:\n\nHow well website and social media accounts are performing\nIf anything needs immediate attention (an organic traffic drop, media mentions, a spike in paid traffic, etc.)\nIf any ads have been disapproved and need to be remastered\n\nWhere to get this data: \n\nA custom Google Analytics (GA) dashboard — for a top-down view of traffic dynamics (number of visitors, traffic sources breakdown, user behavior metrics, etc.)\nA default Home GA report, with the “Active Users Right Now” tab — for a real-time snapshot \n\nHere’s an example of a custom GA dashboard:\n\nFor mentions and media monitoring, you can use:\n\nGoogle Alerts \nMedia Monitoring\nNews Alerts\n\nHere’s what the dashboard can look like in Media Monitoring:\n\nWeekly Marketing Report\n\nWeekly reports help track and analyze the results of your short- and medium-term marketing activities. \n\nFor example, it can take several days to accumulate statistics on the performance of a new blog post, a newly launched PPC campaign, an email blast, etc. \n\nWeekly reports are also useful for making marketing teams aware of goal pacing. \n\nWhat to expect from a weekly report?\n\nA big picture of traffic dynamics: Has overall traffic increased or decreased? Which marketing channels are performing best? And what has changed since the previous week?\nAn idea of how successful your recent marketing campaigns have been in terms of conversions\nA complete overview of vital social media metrics (engagement and followers)\nAn action plan for the coming weeks\n\nWhere to get this data: \n\nGoogle Analytics — for all things traffic and conversions\nSocial Media Tracker — for social media analytics \n\nHere’s an example of a weekly marketing report using My Reports:\n\nGet our Weekly Marketing Report template (Google Drive)\nCreate a custom Weekly Marketing report in My Reports\nMonthly Marketing Report\n\nA monthly marketing report is the most effective and helpful for most organizations. \n\nThe data is big enough to give accurate projections. And you can see trends (and any changes) in context. \n\nFor example, you’re able to see the impact of marketing initiatives and long-term projects. Like SEO, PR, and content marketing campaigns. \n\nA monthly report helps you understand how these projects influence core marketing metrics.\n\nWhat to expect from a monthly report?\n\nA reminder of goals you’re working toward\nOverall website analytics\nGoal completions (sales, conversions, etc.)\nA brief overview of channel or campaign performance\n\nWhere to get this data: \n\nGoogle Analytics dashboard with a monthly time frame\nSocial media analytics to track social engagement and followers\nAn SEO tool like Semrush\n\nHere’s what a monthly marketing report can look like:\n\nGet our Monthly Marketing Report template (Google Drive)\nCreate a custom Monthly Marketing report in My Reports\nMonthly Competitor Analysis Report\n\nA competitor analysis report is a separate (and often underestimated) type of report. \n\nThe great thing about it? It can answer many important questions about your own results. For example:\n\nWhy have you lost rankings for multiple keywords? \nWhy has the cost per click (CPC) for your ad campaigns been increasing?\nWhere should you advertise next? \n\nA competitor analysis report should track:\n\nWebsite traffic and visitor engagement \nOrganic search performance\nLink building performance\nPaid ad strategy \nContent marketing and PR performance\nSocial media performance\n\nWhere to get this data: \n\nA tool like Traffic Analytics to automate the competitor data collection process \n\nHere’s what a monthly competitor analysis report looks like with a template from My Reports:\n\nGet our Monthly Competitor Analysis Report template (Google Drive)\nCreate a Monthly Competitor Analysis report in My Reports\n\nFree Automated Marketing Reporting Tool\n\nCreate reports from dozens of templates [SEO, PPC, Social & More], or from scratch with Semrush\n\nJoin free →\nSEO Reports\n\nAn SEO report is where you can show how your website is performing in terms of SEO metrics. For example, organic traffic, backlinks, technical SEO, etc. \n\nOverall SEO Report\n\nAn overall SEO report summarizes your overall SEO performance. A bit of everything. \n\nIt can help you answer questions like:\n\nHow is website traffic changing?\nWhat is the difference between organic traffic and other sources?\nWhat is the proportion of branded vs. non-branded traffic?\nWhich keywords are driving the most visitors?\nHave organic rankings improved or dropped?\nWhat does the overall backlink profile look like?\nAre there any technical issues threatening SEO results?\n\nWhere to get this data:\n\nGoogle Analytics for all things traffic\nGoogle Search Console for search visibility metrics and technical issues\nSite Audit for SERP features and overall site health issues \n\nHere’s an example of an overall SEO report focusing on keywords from My Reports:\n\nGet our Overall SEO Report template (Google Drive)\nCreate an Overall SEO Report in My Reports\nBacklink Report\n\nA backlink report is specific to backlinks—an important ranking factor and metric for measuring a website’s overall quality. \n\nA backlink report will allow you to find:\n\nThe number of backlinks and referring domains and how this number has changed\nThe proportion of toxic, potentially toxic, and “healthy” links to your website\nThe number of follow vs. nofollow links\nHow you perform against your key competitors\n\nAmong other things. \n\nWhere to get this data: \n\nGoogle Search Console to track the number of backlinks\nBacklink Analytics to quickly evaluate and compare link profiles in depth\n\nHere’s an example of a backlink report using the backlinks template in My Reports:\n\nGet the Backlink Report template (Google Drive)\nCreate a Full Backlink report in My Reports\nTechnical SEO report\n\nTechnical SEO is the process of optimizing a website so search engines can find, crawl, and index your pages. And it’s critical to your SEO success. \n\nDozens of technical issues can harm your site’s performance. Manually finding them would be extremely time-consuming. \n\nCreating a technical SEO report can help you:\n\nFind your site’s technical SEO issues\nPrioritize issues to fix depending on their severity\nTrack your progress and compare crawls \n\nWhere to get this data: \n\nGoogle Search Console, under Core Web Vitals \nSite Audit to get a complete picture of all your issues and suggestions on how to fix them\n\nHere’s what a technical SEO report looks like using My Reports:\n\nCreate a Technical SEO report in My Reports\nSee an example of a Technical SEO report (full 90 pages)\nSocial Media and PR Reports\n\nThings on social media happen very quickly. \n\nYour post can go viral and bring hundreds of new followers and comments. Good and bad. And they all should be addressed as soon as possible. \n\nThis means social media should be monitored on a daily basis. Sometimes even in real-time. \n\nThat being said, you can discern whether your social strategy was successful by seeing the bigger picture. \n\nHere are the metrics and reports that will help you do that:\n\nSocial Media Performance Report\n\nYou need a Social Media Performance report if you want to know:\n\nWhat is happening to your follower base? Is it growing or decreasing? Are demographics and interests changing?\nHow active your brand was on social media in a given period\nWhich posts generated the most engagement (and why)\nHow you stack up against key competitors\nHow many conversions you got from each social media channel\n\nWhere to get this data:\n\nSocial Media Tracker for a full analysis and data-driven recommendations\nGoogle Analytics for referral traffic tracking\n\nHere’s an example of a social media report using My Reports:\n\nGet our Social Media Performance report template (Google Drive)\nCreate a Social Media Performance report in My Reports\nBrand Reputation Report\n\nThe Brand Reputation report helps answer the following questions:\n\nHas brand visibility increased or decreased in a certain period of time?\nWhich mentions contributed the most to brand visibility in terms of referral traffic, awareness, or coverage?\nWhat was the overall sentiment?

A great report takes it one step further and tells the story of that data over a particular time period in relation to a goal. Did we achieve the goal, or are we on track to achieve the goal? Why or why not?\n\nThe report needs to present the right data to answer these questions in a way the client will comprehend and not be overwhelmed by. Simplified and well-labeled graphs, charts, tables, icons, and colors are a great way to visually tell a story with a quick glance. Finally, a great report should be able to stand on its own, without the need for an in-person meeting all the time.”\n\nRoman Zelvenschi\n\nOwner, RomanZ Media Group Inc.\n\n“I deal with both reports that are sent to me and those that need to be delivered to the client. I think there is a bit of a difference between those.\n\nOn the client side:\n\nOn top of actually making clients money, we are also concerned with keeping them happy. As you know, good numbers don't guarantee a client, but bad ones will always get you fired.\n\nClients don't really care about metrics that much; the majority of them don't understand them or cling to the ones that don't influence their marketing objectives. Even if you deal with a great marketing manager, they need to get approval for the budget from someone who doesn't know the difference between bounce and exit rate. \n\nThat is why a great report for a client, from our perspective:\n\nHas a half-page summary that includes what has happened this month and why. Did our plan for last month work, and what are our future plans?\nIdeally will show them how you directly influenced the bottom line\nHas to tell a continuous story each month and be consistent. We can't adjust our interpretation to make numbers look good. So, we can't say one month, ‘The organic traffic is down, but the leads are up, and they are the only important thing,’ and next month, ‘Well leads are down, but look at all of this organic traffic.’\nProvides all of the stats to support the summary at the beginning\nClients are funny about the metrics they deem important. Often, they can have zero relevance to their particular business. Put those in the report too.\nInclude something educational, as no matter how often you say things to clients, they will forget, so we need to repeat the same things many times. For example, ‘This double-digit growth is not sustainable, and we will be moving into protecting keyword positions and traffic maintenance stage in Q4.’\n\nOn reports from my staff:\n\nI need a very clear understanding of what is actually happening with their business. If we are doing well, or we need to put more resources into the client, or the monthly report will be ugly. \n\nI need a daily report on things that are wrong (like disapproved ads or keywords) and what was done to fix them\nWeekly reports on where we are this month YoY on major metrics. Then an explanation of what is moving the numbers with data backup. For example, “organic traffic is down, mainly due to this keyword. We are in the same position for it, but the volume decreased, so there is nothing we can do with it.” For them to get that, they need to cross-reference Semrush, Google Search Console, Analytics, and a CRM system to make sure what they think is happening with numbers is correlated in each system\nWe also report internally on different metrics at each stage of the marketing funnel. That way, we are not just looking at traffic>leads and trying to guess what is happening in between. We pull different levers to increase each stage of the funnel. It is way too granular for the client reporting, and again, most of the time is above their heads.”\n\nKathleen Gier\n\nDirector of Content Strategy, BuilderDesigns\n\n“How does a great marketing report differ from a good one? The most important element of a good report is approachability. It needs to reflect both the interest and knowledge level of your partners in a way that presents the information they want to see and not so much that it is overwhelming.\n\nHow to make a report for a client (or boss) stand out from others? Have some fun with it! Brand your report and add color to make the data a little more exciting. We also like to add some short narratives below each chart that highlight what we think is important and why the results matter.”\n\nMichela Marzoli\n\nSEO & SEM Manager, Club del Sole\n\n“I believe a great marketing report should focus on three features: target, action, and data visualization.\n\nTarget: KPI and marketing dashboards should reflect the final users’ needs. That means, focusing only on Macro-KPI if the users are on top management — such as ROI, LTV, and cost per acquisition. To that report, add processes for Middle Management users, such as conversion paths and attribution models. To that report, add Micro-KPI, if addressed to Specialists, such as CTR, CPC, and position changes.\n\nAction: Every report should be actionable. That means, giving the readers practical suggestions on what to do to improve the KPI. Even just a short phrase at the end of each Dashboard, such as: ‘invest more advertising budget on mobile devices, which drive the best conversion rates.’ This makes the role of the analyst more pragmatic and results-oriented.\n\nData Visualization: Turn data into visual insights, seeking a compromise between creativity and simplicity. Don’t disrupt typical visualization conventions that users expect, such as color conventions (red=danger..) while trying to tell a compelling story, targeted at your final user.”\n\nAutomate Marketing Reports with Semrush\n\nNow that you know how to create marketing reports and why they’re so important, it’s time to take it a step further. \n\nYou can create, customize, and schedule PDF reports for your clients.
