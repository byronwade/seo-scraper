  "content": "To create a successful podcast, you need more than just a great show. \n\nYou need strong podcast SEO that helps your quality content be found by relevant listeners. \n\nIf your series isn’t easy to find on search engines (including platforms like Spotify and Apple Podcasts), you’ll lose out on organic traffic, listens, downloads, and brand awareness. \n\nIn this article, you’ll learn how SEO for podcasts can make or break your show. Including tips and real-world examples that can help you boost your podcast’s rankings. \n\nLet’s dive in.\n\nWhy Podcast SEO Matters\n\nPodcast SEO is a series of tasks that help your show and episodes rank highly on search engines for relevant keywords. \n\nWithout doing these tasks, your target listeners will probably have a hard time finding your content when they search for podcasts like yours.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause there are millions of podcasts available (5 million on Spotify alone). With more episodes being published every day.\n\nSo, taking the time to optimize your podcast for searchers helps ensure it doesn’t get buried among the competition.\n\nHere’s how podcast SEO specifically supports your podcast performance:\n\nIt Increases Search Visibility for Your Brand\n\nAs noted by Edison, the top way listeners discover podcasts is by searching the web for them. Like on Google or apps such as Spotify and Apple Podcasts.\n\nImage Source: Edison\n\nPodcast SEO tactics can get your episodes to rank higher in those search results.\n\nWhich then helps you:\n\nIncrease listenership (and potentially website visitors if your podcast makes up part of your marketing funnel)\nBoost your topical authority (establishing your website—and yourself—as an expert in the space)\nAttract higher-profile guests (because some guests will only get out of bed for podcasts with a certain number of listeners)\nAppeal to more sponsors (because those fancy microphones don’t pay for themselves)\n\nFor instance, SEO can help your true crime podcast top Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs):\n\nIn this list, you see podcasts with “true crime,” “criminal,” and even “best true crime” in the title. Which are all relevant keywords for someone looking for a new true crime show.\n\nSo, these titles are like signposts for the search engine to serve these results to someone looking for the “best true crime podcasts.”\n\nThe same principle applies on podcast platforms.\n\nHere’s one real-world example:\n\nPodcast agency Voxalyze encouraged a real estate client to replace an irrelevant word in its podcast title with a more relevant, high-volume keyword. And it jumped to the third-highest position on Spotify and Apple Podcasts for that search term.\n\nRun a Full Keyword Analysis\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nIt Increases Opportunities for Link Building\n\nLink building involves getting another website (ideally one with a good reputation) to link to your website. \n\nWhy is this important?\n\nBecause those backlinks are an important ranking factor for Google. They’re like little endorsements for your brand from a trusted authority.\n\nAnd podcast SEO can help you get more of them.\n\nAdding your website link to your show notes on podcast platforms is one way to get links from one site to another. \n\nYou can also add your website to your podcast’s social media page and its own website if you’ve created a separate site for it. Like Kate Toon’s link on her podcast’s Instagram page:\n\nNote\n\nCreating your own backlinks won’t have the same impact on your rankings as getting linked to from different sources. But it’s still good practice.\n\nAnd every podcast guest is a potential backlink waiting to happen. Ask them to share a link on their website and social media. Odds are, they’ll say yes.\n\nBuild Backlinks Easily\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nIt Accelerates Content Production on Other Platforms\n\nYou put a lot of effort into each podcast episode. Like completing extensive research on topics your target audience is interested in and planning, recording, and promoting your content.\n\nSo why save all that work for just one platform?\n\nGet in front of more potential listeners by repurposing your podcast.\n\nRecycling and repurposing podcast content means reusing all or elements of your episodes in new formats. \n\nFor example, Refine Labs CEO Chris Walker shares clips of his filmed podcast on TikTok:\n\nWalker’s video then acts like a trailer for his podcast, attracting new listeners from the TikTok audience who want to hear more. All without having to create brand-new content.\n\nConduct audience research to figure out which social media platforms are best suited to reach your listener demographic.\n\nAnd a repurposing strategy doesn’t just work for visual podcasts, either. You can also create social media posts using quotes from your podcast transcript. (We’ll talk more about transcripts later.)\n\nHow to Optimize Your Podcast for Search Engines\n\nIf you don’t know how to use podcast SEO to your advantage, you’ll miss out on a good chunk of new listeners and business.\n\nHere are six podcast SEO tips for optimizing your podcast to rank highly on Google and podcast app search engines:\n\n1. Use Strategic Keywords for Podcast Episode Titles and Descriptions\n\nPeople will only search for your podcast specifically if they know what your show's title is. \n\nSo, to boost your chances of being found by relevant listeners out there, you need to use keywords in your titles and descriptions that they’re likely to search.\n\nIn fact, Apple Podcasts notes that show’s name and episode titles are key when serving up “the “best possible match” to searchers. \n\nTo find the right keywords to help your podcast climb search rankings, start with keyword research. You can learn the basics in our three-step guide.\n\nAnd when you’re ready to advance, we have a whole suite of tools to help you dig deeper (and rank higher):\n\nHow to Optimize Your Show Description\n\nA keyword-optimized podcast description adds context to your title and provides details on the theme. Search engines then connect these terms to your podcast, increasing your chances of ranking for them.\n\nHere’s a well-optimized example from short-form marketing broadcast Copyblogger FM:\n\nThere are strategic, relevant terms related to content marketing. So, search engine algorithms are more likely to show a link to Copyblogger FM when people search for a podcast on those topics.\n\nAnd in just two sentences, Copyblogger FM covers the main points for potential listeners:\n\nThe hosts’ names\nCovered topics \nShow frequency (i.e., when new episodes drop)\n\nFollow their lead and keep things brief and informative.\n\nHow to Optimize Your Episode Titles\n\nEpisode titles tell podcast platforms what the topic of each show is. The search algorithms then try to match those titles to searched phrases so they can deliver relevant results to users.\n\nKeep titles simple and search friendly. Include:\n\nThe episode theme (including a relevant keyword)\nGuest names (if applicable)\nA phrase that meets search intent (e.g., “how to write a kids book” instead of “kids book”)\n\nAnd try to keep your episode titles under 60 characters. Longer titles risk getting cut off in search results.\n\nLet’s look at these examples from The Agents of Change Podcast:\n\nEach easy-to-read title is under 60 characters. And they each include a unique digital marketing keyword. Like “AI content,” “homepage,” and “sales funnel.”\n\nAll three include the guest’s name. This makes episodes more visible to people searching for a particular industry influencer. \n\nTitles should always address search intent, or the main reason searchers are searching for a certain term. In many cases for podcasts, the intent will be to learn about something—an informational intent.\n\nFor example, using a question such as “Should AI write your content?” conveys it’ll be answered during the podcast. While a “How to” title tells the listener that they’ll get clear instructions within the episode.\n\nGet Writing Recommendations\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Optimize Your Episode Descriptions\n\nDescriptions often get cut off after the first couple of sentences. So it’s important to make these early characters count to grab your listener’s attention. \n\nLet’s look at an episode of The Email Marketing Show on referral marketing:\n\nThe description starts strong by hooking people in with a question. \n\nThey clearly sum up the value they’re sharing with their audience so they can quickly scan the text and determine if it’s worth their time to listen.\n\nAnd they fit in the relevant “referral marketing strategy” keyword early on in the second line.\n\nThese elements make it a description that both humans and search engines will respond well to. \n\n2. Meet Search Intent With Relevant, Compelling Topics\n\nAdding keywords is a great start for discoverability. But you can’t just add keywords to content and expect to reap allthe rewards. \n\nTo keep people listening and coming back for the next episode, you need to deliver the value you promised in the episode title and description.\n\nThat’s where search intent comes in.\n\nSay a listener searches for “vegetable gardening podcasts” and sees the BBC Gardeners’ World Magazine Podcast episode titled “Growing Your Own Food - With Monty Don.”\n\nIf the podcast goes down too many detours and side conversations not related to vegetable gardening, they’re likely to turn it off. Likewise if it doesn’t include enough quality advice from Monty.\nIf you target relevant keywords with your shows but don’t successfully meet the why behind why people are searching for them, people won’t stay to listen.\n\nAnd these bounces tell search engines your content isn’t relevant. \n\nThe result? \n\nDeprioritization and a drop in rankings.\n\nFocus on creating episodes that answer listeners’ questions, solve their problems, and provide an enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can use Semrush’s Topic Research tool to find hot topics in your podcast niche that users are searching for. This way, you can create podcast content that better speaks to your audience and satisfies search engines.\n\nEnter a seed keyword (a broad term related to your content) and click “Get content ideas.”\n\nOn the dashboard, you’ll see trending ideas, questions, and headlines related to your seed keyword. \n\nClick on one of the cards to expand it with more ideas to cover in your episode, including common questions and potential podcast titles.\n\nFor example, this “email marketing” keyword has a lot of questions related to learning how to easily collect a bunch of email addresses. Creating an episode that clearly solves and targets the “how to” portion would be a smart way to meet search intent. \n\nAnd you can add filters like search volume, keyword difficulty (KD), and location to dig even deeper on a subtopic. \n\nPro tip\n\nTry Semrush’s Audience Intelligence app for more data-driven insights on potential listeners \n\n3. Include Show Notes and Transcripts\n\nAdd show notes and transcripts to help Google understand your podcast content in more depth. \n\nAdding transcripts also makes your podcast content more accessible to people who are hard of hearing.\n\nThe Email Marketing Show does a nice job creating user- and search-friendly show notes and transcripts:\n\nThese elements work in the same way that headings help break up blog posts for skim reading. Listeners can quickly jump to parts that interest them. \n\nAnd instead of transcribing the whole conversation verbatim, hosts Rob and Kennedy just include the main parts to keep the content more skimmable and engaging.\n\nThey keep their authentic British tone (e.g., “purposely a bit crap”). And the content uses keywords in a way that feels natural instead of forced.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse a tool like Sonix, Happy Scribe, or GoTranscript (which uses human transcribers) to turn your conversations into written content. And give potential listeners and search engines more context and value.\n\nFinally, The Email Marketing Show includes reference links and clear calls-to-action (CTAs). \n\nThese instruct podcast listeners on what to do next, like visiting your landing pages and social media accounts.\n\n4. Build Backlinks Through Your Listeners and Guests\n\nYou can link to your website on your podcast platforms and social media. But you can also get backlinks from another source: your listeners.\n\nFor example, our Backlink Analytics tool shows that an episode of Google’s Search Off the Record podcast on staging and launching a new site has 80 backlinks: \n\nListeners like sharing when they’ve learned something new. And many of these 80 backlinks are likely from listeners who’ve mentioned this show’s episode in their own posts.\n\nEncourage your fans to share links to your podcast. These backlinks signal search engines that you’re producing high-quality content that resonates with people.\n\nPlus, mentions from listeners can attract new, relevant listeners from their audience to your podcast. \n\nYou can also gain backlinks from your guests.\n\nInviting an industry expert onto your podcast is a great way to increase links to your page and boost your credibility.\n\nTake Kate Toon’s chat with John Mueller on The Recipe for SEO Success:\n\nMueller is a Search Advocate at Google and a respected name in the industry. His appearance on the podcast was relevant and exciting for current listeners and likely brought new listeners to the show—in the form of Mueller’s followers. \n\nThis kind of hype increases the likelihood of people talking about and sharing the podcast. Which translates to more backlinks.\n\nAnd Toon’s show may appear in searches related to John Mueller or Google SEO.\n\nMonitor your industry for influencers with interesting opinions and expert knowledge. Invite them onto your podcast and record an in-depth conversation that’s a win-win.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse an app like Influencer Analytics to easily find influencers in your podcast niche who could be potential guests\n\nGet Insights on Backlink Profiles\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Select an Appropriate Podcast Category and Tags\n\nGoogle and podcast platforms use your podcast category and tags to suggest your show to relevant listeners. And listeners can use these filters to search for new shows in categories they enjoy.\n\nFor example, Apple Podcasts suggests personalized recommendations for listeners based on their category choices.\n\nImage Source: Engadget\n\nSo, say you host an architectural podcast. You’ll want to target an audience that listens to similar podcasts in the Architecture category, like “About Buildings + Cities” and “Archispeak.”\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause this targeted group is most likely to enjoy your content on similar themes.\n\nSo, look at successful podcasts in your category. Explore the tags they use, like “floorplan” or “building.” And see if your topic appears under a more relevant category you might be missing out on (e.g., Design).\n\nThis tactic works for Google, too.\n\nSay your podcast is about email marketing. \n\nOptimizing for keywords related to the “email marketing” category will help it appear in search results for people looking for “podcasts about email marketing” or “best email marketing podcasts.” \n\nThis strategy applies whether you host your podcast on your website or an external platform. (Or both.)\n\nChoosing strategic tags is equally important. Just like you use hashtags to amplify social media posts, podcast hosting platforms use tags to help users find relevant content.\n\nFor example, the Search News You Can Use Podcast includes broad tags like “SEO” and more specific tags like the host’s name “Marie Haynes.”\n\nYour episode topic and keyword research should guide your tags. \n\nImportant:\n\nThere’s no magic “right” number of tags. Instead, focus more on choosing a thoughtful mix of broad and niche tags to see which impact engagement.\n\nOnly choosing broad tags will make it harder to stand out. While only choosing longer, more niche tags will make episodes harder to find.\n\nDoing both means you’re more likely to show up for searches related to relevant categories and subjects (e.g., Business and Marketing) and sub-topics (e.g., “content marketing strategy” or “referral marketing methods”). \n\n6. Create and Optimize Your Podcast Website\n\nCreate an SEO-friendly podcast website to make it even easier for users to find your show on search engines like Google and Bing. \n\nA podcast website helps you promote your podcast further and lets you share extra info about your show. And the more traffic your website gets, the easier it’s going to be to rank for relevant podcast searches.\n\nLet’s look at the website for Email Marketing Heroes, which hosts “The Email Marketing Show”:\n\nTheir homepage gives readers more insight into the show and the people behind it. And their most recent podcasts are embedded in linked podcast pages that also repurpose the show content as blog posts. Which is a solid, low-lift SEO tactic.\n\nBecause you have more space with web pages than show notes, you can dive deeper into what the episode is about and incorporate more relevant keywords.\n\nIf you don’t already have a site, use a tool like WordPress or Squarespace to set one up.\n\nThen, use the tips in our SEO web design guide to ensure it’s ready to rank:\n\nCreate a mobile-friendly design: Meet Google’s mobile-first approach to crawling, indexing, and ranking websites\nBoost site speed: Fast page speed (a confirmed Google ranking factor) means people are more likely to stick around\nBuild an intuitive site structure: An organized site architecture helps search engines understand the way your pages and topics connect to each other\nMake your site discoverable: Prioritize indexability and crawlability to ensure search engines can find and rank your content\nImprove user experience (UX): Follow Google’s accessibility guidelines to open your site to a broader podcast audience and boost UX\n\nAnd our Site Audit tool lets you uncover technical issues that impact your ability to rank.\n\nLet’s look at site speed. \n\nEmbedding audio players on your website could slow it down, so you’ll definitely want to keep an eye on it.\n\nHead to the Site Audit dashboard and enter your website URL.\n\nThen, click “Start Audit.”\n\nIn the Settings window, select how many pages you want the tool to crawl and its crawl source. \n\nThen, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nYou’ll see a dashboard overview of your site’s SEO performance. \n\nFor site speed, click “View details” under “Site Performance” or “Core Web Vitals.”\n\nUse the reports to get recommendations on how to fix any issues the tool finds.\n\nFurther reading: What Is Page Speed & How to Improve It\n\nPodcast SEO Makes Your Hard Work Worthwhile\n\nYou don’t want to spend all your energy and resources on a show that doesn’t have a strong return on investment. A solid podcast SEO strategy will help get your content in front of people who care about it.\n\nWith greater visibility comes more significant opportunities to dominate the podcast charts and grow your brand. \n\nKeep things simple with our Podcast Hosting app and learn how to optimize your series for visibility, analyze your performance, and gain more listeners.",
