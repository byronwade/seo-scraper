  "content": "Keyword metrics are essential data points that tell you whether a keyword is worth targeting.\n\nYou can find keyword metrics using keyword analysis tools like Keyword Overview.\n\nThey look like this:\n\nKeyword metrics are important because not every keyword you find will be worth creating content for.\n\nSome will be irrelevant to your audience. Many will be too competitive. And others will have too little potential to be worth the effort.\n\nBut you’ll also come across some that are perfect for your site.\n\nKeyword metrics help you sort through these options and pick the best keywords.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll cover the six most important keyword metrics SEOs should look at when choosing keywords to target.\n\nAnd then show you how to find the right keywords for your website. Today.\n\nFind & Analyze Keyword Metrics\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n1. Search Volume\n\nSearch volume is the average number of times a keyword is searched per month.\n\nHigh search volume indicates popularity. Meaning a lot of people are searching for that specific keyword.\n\nTargeting and ranking well for a keyword with high search volume can mean more website traffic. Which can lead to more potential sales (if that’s your goal).\n\nTo analyze a keyword’s search volume, use Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool. \n\nJust enter your keyword into the tool. And you'll see its monthly search volume. Along with other useful metrics.\n\nTarget keywords with sufficient search volume—we recommend at least 100 monthly searches as a general rule of thumb. That way, your efforts are more likely to yield meaningful traffic.\n\nTargeting keywords with low search volume (like 10-20 searches per month) probably won’t bring enough visitors to your site.\n\nNote\n\nIf your business is international, consider the global search volume of the keyword. This metric will give you a better picture of overall traffic potential.\n​​​​​\n\nSemrush provides global search volume for any keyword. And country-specific data. Simply toggle the region in the top-left corner of Keyword Overview.\n \n\nCollect Keyword Metrics\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Keyword Difficulty (KD)\n\nKeyword difficulty shows how hard it would be to rank on page one of Google for a specific keyword.\n\nA higher difficulty score means you may need to put in more effort to rank well for that keyword.\n\nMost SEO tools provide a difficulty score. Usually on a scale of 1-100.\n\nSemrush does the same but goes one step further: It provides a personalized difficulty score for your domain specifically.\n\nWe call this metric personal keyword difficulty (PKD).\n\nTo find your PKD, enter your keyword into the Keyword Overview tool. And enter your domain name into the field provided.\n\nThen hit “Search.”\n\nThis will ensure that your PKD score appears. Along with other AI-powered keyword metrics (e.g., “Topical Authority” and “Your potential position on SERP”).\n\nLower difficulty keywords are often easier targets, especially for new websites. If you fall into this category, any keyword with a PKD score below 30% is a great opportunity to consider.\n\n3. Search Intent\n\nSearch intent is the purpose behind a user's search query. \n\nThis isn’t a “metric” in the classic sense, but it’s important to understand it. Because it tells you what type of content to create to rank for your target keyword.\n\nContent that matches the searcher’s intent is much more likely to rank high in search results.\n\nThe four primary search intents are:\n\nInformational: Users are looking for information or answers to questions. They may be seeking how-to guides, definition posts, or general knowledge about a topic. For example, \"What is SEO?\" or \"How to bake a cake.\"\nNavigational: Users intend to find a specific website or page. They may enter a brand name as part of their query. For example, \"Facebook login\" or \"Amazon.\"\nCommercial: Users are researching products or services with the intent to make a purchase in the future. They may compare options or read reviews. For example, \"best smartphones 2024\" or \"laptop reviews.\"\nTransactional: Users are ready to make a purchase or complete a transaction. This intent is often indicated by keywords like \"buy,\" \"order,\" or \"discount.\" For example, \"buy running shoes online\" or \"best price for a camera.\"\n\nLook up a keyword’s search intent in Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool.\n\nPro tip\n\nTo get even more inspiration on what type of content to create, scroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section. And open the top-ranking articles by clicking on the “open in external link” icon.\n \n\n \nLook at the structures and topics of the top-ranking content. And use the information to inspire your own content.\n\nOnce you identify the search intent behind a keyword, create quality content that aligns with that intent.\n\nFurther reading: Quality Content: What It Is + 10 Actionable Tips for Success\n\n4. Search Trend\n\nSearch trend shows how the popularity of a keyword has changed over time. \n\nIt gives you insight into whether people’s interest in a topic or keyword is growing, declining, or steady.\n\nA declining trend might indicate that the keyword is becoming less relevant over time. So it may be OK to deprioritize this keyword.\n\nAn upward trend, on the other hand, suggests that interest in the keyword is growing. Which means it might be a good opportunity to jump on early and target that keyword.\n\nThe Keyword Overview tool will help you analyze keywords’ search trends.\n\nNote\n\nSome keywords have predictable patterns based on seasons or events. For example, \"Christmas gift ideas\" will spike in November and December. \n \n\nRecognizing these seasonal trends will help you plan your content calendar effectively.\n \n\nIn this example, you might want to create (or update) content related to Christmas gifts before the holiday season. To capture the surge in interest.\n\n5. Cost Per Click (CPC)\n\nCost per click shows you how much advertisers pay for each click on their ads for a specific keyword.\n\nWhile CPC is primarily used in paid advertising, it's also valuable for SEO.\n\nA high CPC often suggests that advertisers are willing to pay more for clicks on that keyword. Which could indicate a higher conversion potential and value for your business.\n\nCPC can vary significantly across industries. A \"high\" CPC in one niche might be average in another.\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Overview tool will show you CPC.\n\nNote\n\nCPC data is an average calculation. Actual costs for a paid campaign could be higher or lower.\n\n6. SERP Features\n\nSERP features are special elements that appear on search engine results pages (SERPs) in addition to the standard organic listings.\n\nLike this:\n\nSERP features are important to consider when choosing keywords. Because SERP features can significantly impact your visibility.\n\nCommon SERP features include:\n\nFeatured snippets: These are brief answers or summaries that appear at the top of the SERP\nPeople also ask: A box containing related questions and expandable answers\nLocal pack: A map and list of local businesses relevant to the search query\nKnowledge panel: An information box that appears on the right side of the SERP for certain entity-based searches\n\nIf your keywords trigger SERP features, there is an opportunity to gain additional visibility.\n\nYou can check this using Semrush's Keyword Overview tool. The tool shows the snapshot of the results page and the various SERP features that appear for that keyword.\n\nBonus: 4 Tips for Choosing the Right Keywords\n\nHere are some important things to keep in mind when selecting keywords for SEO. \n\nMake Sure Keywords Are Relevant to Your Business\n\nThis one is pretty obvious. But it's worth emphasizing. \n\nRelevance is crucial because it ensures that you're attracting the right audience—people who are actually interested in what you offer.\n\nThe keywords you choose should be directly related to your products, services, or content. And your goals.\n\nFor example, a blog post selling products should target keywords like “top 10 running shoes in 2024.” Not “How to fix your running shoes.”\n\nUsing irrelevant keywords might bring traffic. But that traffic probably won’t convert.\n\nIdentify the Quick Wins, but Have a Long-Term Strategy\n\nWhen you’re just starting out, choose low-difficulty keywords to get quick wins.\n\nThese keywords can help you gain some initial traction. And start driving traffic to your site faster. \n\nWhile quick wins are important, don't neglect more competitive, high-volume keywords entirely.\n\nRanking for these terms will take more time and effort. But they can provide substantial traffic in the long run. So start targeting them from day one so you’re well-positioned for future growth.\n\nAnalyze the SERPs\n\nBefore you finalize your keyword choices, analyze the SERPs for those keywords. \n\nThis analysis will help you understand the competitors you need to outrank.\n\nIf the top-ranking pages are from well-known brands in your industry, it may be more challenging to outrank them. Especially if you're a newer or smaller player. \n\nThese established websites often have strong authority, a large number of backlinks, and quality content that search engines favor.\n\nYou can see the analysis report of top competitors directly within Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool.\n\nLook at Multiple Metrics Together\n\nDuring keyword analysis, consider multiple metrics together (not in isolation).\n\nFor instance, a keyword with moderate search volume and low difficulty might seem attractive at first glance. However, if it has a low CPC and doesn't trigger any useful SERP features, it may not be as valuable as initially thought. \n\nOn the other hand, a keyword with slightly lower search volume but a high CPC, moderate difficulty, and the potential to appear in a featured snippet could be a more strategic choice.\n\nSo look at all the metrics to get a well-rounded view of the potential value from the keyword.\n\nAnd remember that Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool provides all the data you need to make the right choices.\n\nUse Keyword Metrics to Choose the Perfect Keywords\n\nKeyword metrics tell you whether a keyword is worth targeting.\n\nWhile a keyword like “what are trail running shoes” might look like the perfect keyword for a shoe store, it may not be, depending on your goals.\n\nEspecially since the keyword is difficult to rank for (with a 57% keyword difficulty score). And has an informational intent, meaning searchers looking up this keyword aren’t looking to buy running shoes.\n\nUse Keyword Overview to find AI-powered keyword metrics. So you can target relevant keywords that will actually contribute to your brand’s bottom line.\n\nCollect Keyword Metrics\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
