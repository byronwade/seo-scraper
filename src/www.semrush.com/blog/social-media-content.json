  "content": "Social media content can generate brand awareness, increase customer loyalty, and drive other positive outcomes for your business.\n\nBut with so much noise on social media, it’s hard to know which posts will stand out and resonate with your target audience.\n\nWhich is why we’ve created this list of 10 types of social media content to use across your social media accounts to drive your desired results.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Social Content Ideation (included in the Semrush Social app) to generate social content ideas for your brand. It can help with everything from ideas to hashtags that are relevant to your brand.\n\n1. Short-Form Promotional Videos\n\nA short-form promotional video is a type of social media content focused on one of your products or services that’s five seconds to three minutes long. \n\nFor example, Instagram reels are short-form videos ranging from 15 to 90 seconds. And can easily be used for promotional purposes. \n\nHere’s an Instagram reel from Nike that promotes their new athletic wear.\n\nNot every organization will have Nike’s marketing budget. But even a small business committed to social media can make reels work for them.\n\nCheck out how local fitness club Kin Culture uses Instagram reels to promote their weekly running club. \n\nBoth reels worked because they’re visually engaging. And they provide the viewer with information about the brand and what it has to offer.\n\nBenefits of Short-Form Videos\nBetter Reach and Discoverability\n\nMany social media platforms prioritize short-form videos in their algorithms, increasing the likelihood of your content being seen by a wider audience.\n\nGood for Ad Campaigns\n\nShort-form video is well-suited for social media advertising campaigns. Which can help you reach new audiences and achieve your goals faster.\n\nPotentially Higher Engagement Rates\n\nShort-form promotional videos are ideal for an audience with a limited attention span. Their brief nature makes it more likely that viewers will watch the whole video, share it, etc.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Social Analytics to gain insights into how your social media content is performing on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.\n \n\nIncrease Your Social Media Reach\n\nwith Semrush Social\n\nStart Now →\n2. Behind-the-Scenes Videos\n\nBehind-the-scenes videos give viewers a glimpse into the inner workings of your business. To help build trust and credibility.\n\nAnd because most people are naturally curious, this footage piques their interest. Which may encourage likes, comments, and messages.\n\nBehind-the-scenes videos could include employee highlights, the product development process, or upcoming launch teasers. \n\nYou could even create comedic insights into office life like Semrush does on Instagram.\n\nBenefits of Behind-the-Scenes Videos\nBetter Storytelling\n\nBehind-the-scenes videos allow brands to tell their stories more effectively by showing the journey, struggles, and successes behind the scenes.\n\nIncreased Connection with Your Audience\n\nThese videos can build a stronger connection between your audience and brand by showing the human side of your business. Which can foster trust.\n\nMore Anticipation\n\nUse behind-the-scenes videos to tease new products, store openings, or other events to build excitement for your launch. \n\n3. Tutorials and How-to Videos\n\nTutorials and how-to videos share the process of how something is done. Think about that last DIY video you saw on YouTube—that’s an example of a tutorial video.\n\nTutorials and how-to videos let you share knowledge with your target audience and establish yourself as an expert in your field. \n\nFor example, cooking brand Tasty creates authoritative, visually engaging tutorial videos on their TikTok channel.\n\nAnd note that how-to videos can work well as long-form content. Especially if the process is lengthy or involved. \n\nBenefits of Tutorials and How-To Videos\nPotentially Better Engagement\n\nTutorial videos encourage repeat views and shares as people return to the content for reference. Which drives sustained engagement.\n\nIncreases Authority\n\nSharing tutorials and showing your target audience the depth of your expertise helps establish credibility. Which builds trust. \n\nHas Long-Term Value\n\nBecause tutorials and how-to videos are evergreen (i.e., they don’t go out of date), they can attract views and engagement over a long period of time. \n\n4. User-Generated Content\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is any content created by customers, fans, and other users. And is repurposed by businesses—typically on their own social media channels.\n\nBecause UGC is created by users, it acts as a personal recommendation about a product or service. Which is likely to be seen as more trustworthy to other prospects.\n\nOne of the most impactful examples of UGC comes from Apple. \n\nThe company’s #ShotoniPhone campaign challenged iPhone users to shoot and post their best photos on Instagram and X (formerly Twitter). \n\nFrom submissions, Apple selected the best images to use on billboard campaigns around the world.\n\nHere’s a #ShotoniPhone example from a follower in Germany.\n\nReviews and testimonials are another type of UGC that businesses can use (though it often takes a bit more work to create the posts). \n\nSkincare brand Purito Seoul uses a customer review to highlight their line of sun lotion.\n\nNotice how they’ve used a carousel? This means they can share more than one positive customer review in a single post, helping reinforce the message that the viewer should purchase their product.\n\nBenefits of UGC Content\nShows Social Proof\n\nUGC is created by real users. Which means it can be more relatable and trustworthy than brand-generated content.\n\nGrows Brand Loyalists\n\nBecause UGC encourages audience engagement, they feel part of a community. Which can result in brand advocacy and long-term relationships.\n\nCost-Effective\n\nBecause users create the content themselves, it keeps your social media production costs low.\n\n5. Influencer Marketing Content\n\nInfluencer marketing is when a brand partners with an influencer to create content that promotes the brand’s products or services.\n\nNote\n\nInfluencer marketing is a paid tactic. But it’s worth covering given how well it can support your efforts on social media.\n\nBrands use influencer marketing to achieve numerous goals, but it can be particularly effective for increasing sales. Because users often make purchasing decisions based on influencer posts. \n\nThis is how Ice Spice and Dunkin’ worked together to promote the company’s America Runs on Donuts campaign:\n\nIf your social media funds don’t stretch to big name celebrities, look for smaller influencers in your niche to build mutually beneficial relationships with.\n\nAll that said, influencer marketing isn’t for everyone. Consider your audience and your budget before using it as part of your social media content marketing plan.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Influencer Analytics to help you find the right influencer for your goals and manage your entire influencer marketing campaign in one place. \n\nBenefits of Influencer Marketing\nIncreased Reach\n\nInfluencer marketing to increase your reach on social media by tapping into the influencer’s follower base. \n\nAccess to Expert Creators\n\nWorking with influencers allows you to leverage their skills to create engaging content that resonates with your target audience and drives results.\n\nPotentially More Sales\n\nWorking with influencers to promote your products or services can lead to more sales. Because influencers’ followers are likely to trust their recommendations and proceed with a purchase.\n\n6. Live Videos and Streams\n\nIncorporating live video and streaming into your social media content strategy can help you generate engagement in real time. And interact directly with your audience. \n\nYou can use live video to host one-off or special events, introduce new research, respond to customer questions, or collaborate with influencers and industry experts. \n\nHere’s an example of how Airbnb used YouTube to host a live discussion on how to create welcoming spaces. \n\nPro tip\n\nRecord all streams and live events so you can repurpose that content for other platforms and formats.\n\nBenefits of Live Videos and Streams\nSense of Urgency and Exclusivity\n\nLive content is often perceived as unique. Which can persuade more users to tune in.\n\nPrimed for Social Media Algorithms\n\nSocial media algorithms encourage live content. So your followers get a notification when you go live, which can increase reach and engagement.\n\nAllows You to Collect Feedback\n\nLive video can be a two-way communication channel with your audience. Use this to your advantage and ask for feedback in the moment to help improve your products, services, or future events. \n\n7. Q&As and AMAs\n\nRun live question and answer (Q&A) or ask me anything (AMA) sessions to build personal connections with your followers. And show your expertise. \n\nYou can do this in different ways:\n\nAs a live video on Instagram\nAs a text-based question-and-answer session on Reddit\nAs a live-tweet thread on X\n\nAfter the Q&A or AMA session, you can grab screenshots and/or clips and repurpose that content into different formats.\n\nReddit is well-known for hosting AMAs with established cultural figures. \n\nOne of their most popular and memorable AMAs was with Jon Stewart, a comedian and writer. And he used the platform to help promote a new show on Apple TV.\n\nPro tip\n\nPlanning goes a long way with Q&A- and AMA-type posts. If you don’t have a social media content plan yet, follow this guide to creating a social media calendar.\n\nBenefits of Q&As and AMAs\nGenerate Engagement\n\nQ&As and AMAs are naturally conversational and question-based. This means there’s an opportunity to generate lots of engagement with this type of social media content.\n\nGreater Transparency\n\nOpening your business up to questions demonstrates transparency, which helps grow consumer trust—especially when you host a conversation with a CEO, owner, or founder. \n\nAllows for Genuine Connections\n\nAddressing customer comments, questions, and concerns directly shows you care about their opinions and are interested in what they have to say. Which helps strengthen relationships.\n\n8. Simple Images and Image Carousels\n\nSharing photos lets businesses quickly convey concepts with their audiences. And can tap into emotions. \n\nAnd images are a brilliant option for smaller businesses that might not have the marketing budget to partner with more expensive influencers. Or create lots of video content.\n\nPalate uses images to promote its wine tasting event and showcase its brick-and-mortar shop to encourage sign-ups.\n\nBenefits of Images and Image Carousels\nEasy to Produce\n\nBecause mobile devices are equipped with powerful cameras, anyone can create an image for social media. \n\nPro tip\n\nUse AI Social Content Generator to generate social media posts. Complete with images (or videos), a caption, and hashtags relevant to your brand.\n\nVisually Engaging\n\nUsing eye-catching colors and design that align with your brand identity can entice users to stop scrolling. And even click.\n\nAllows You to Test\n\nPlay around with the use of color, style, language, and design variations. So you can see what drives the most engagement.\n\n9. Infographics\n\nInfographics are both visual and informative—two factors that drive engagement.\n\nAnd because infographics are easy to scan, audiences can consume a lot of information in a short amount of time. \n\nBecause infographics distill complex information, they’re often used by B2B companies to help explain processes.\n\nHere’s an example we shared on LinkedIn that shows how to conduct an SEO audit:\n\nIf your infographics are particularly useful, they can also acquire backlinks (assuming they’re published on your website) to support search engine optimization efforts. And gain press mentions that help drive brand awareness.\n\nYou can create infographics using tools such as Canva, Visme, and Miro to make creating content for social media fast and easy.\n\nBenefits of Infographics\nEye-Catching\n\nInfographics’ combination of information and visual design makes them highly shareable, which can improve your social media reach.\n\nSimplify Complex Information\n\nInfographics help simplify complicated information or insights by breaking down data, statistics, or concepts into visual elements that are easier to understand.\n\nEasy to Repurpose for Other Campaigns\n\nInfographics are versatile. Which means you can use them in multiple ways. For example, email campaigns and landing pages.\n\n10. Memes and GIFs\n\nYou’re not using memes and GIFs as part of your social content strategy?\n\nUsing well-timed memes and GIFs in your social content helps you tap into trends, demonstrate your sense of humor, and keep your audience entertained.\n\nWendy’s is known for being a particularly funny brand on X. And they often join in on trending memes or create their own.\n\nJust make sure the content is relevant to you. Otherwise, it can feel forced and hit a sour note with your audience. \n\nBenefits of Memes and GIFs\nHighly Shareable\n\nBecause memes are usually funny or comedic, people are often eager to share them. So there’s a big opportunity for your social media post to reach a wide audience. In some cases, they can even go viral.\n\nKeeps You Current\n\nKnowing what’s trending online and capitalizing on that with memes and GIFs keeps you connected to your audience’s new interests. \n\nCan Say a Lot with a Little\n\nUsing memes and GIFs allows you to express ideas and emotions in a matter of seconds.\n\nManage Your Social Media Content\n\nThere are many other types of social content you can add to your calendar. So, experiment to see what works.\n\nAnd use Semrush Social to manage all your social media efforts. The tool helps with scheduling, monitoring and responding to messages, analyzing performance, and much more.\n\nTry it today.\n\nElevate Your Digital Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
