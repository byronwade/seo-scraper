  "content": "What Is Competitive Intelligence?\n\nCompetitive intelligence (also known as corporate intelligence or CI) involves gathering and analyzing information about your competitors, target customers, and market. Which enables you to make contextual, data-led business decisions.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to establish or enhance a competitive advantage.\n\nUnlike corporate espionage, corporate intelligence does not rely on unethical methods of data collection. It involves detailed analysis of openly accessible information and information you compile yourself. \n\nLet’s say you’re in charge of a new product’s pricing strategy.\n\nAs part of competitive intelligence gathering, you could: \n\nCollect pricing information from rival websites\nSurvey target customers about what they’re willing to pay\nLearn about economic conditions in each sales region\n\nThis data would help you set a pricing strategy that maximizes profit potential.\n\nWhy Is Competitive Intelligence Important?\n\nCompetitive intelligence is important because it allows businesses to make decisions designed to help them outperform their rivals based on data rather than guesswork.\n\nThis can streamline the decision-making process. And generate better outcomes.\n\nFor example:\n\nSales teams can modify pitches based on competitor claims and shortcomings\nMarketing teams can refine messages to stand apart from their rivals’\nProduct teams can strategize roadmaps around features their competitors’ overlooked\n\nPlus, competitive intelligence enables companies to identify and react to trends more quickly. \n\nThis helps them capitalize on market demands and anticipate challenges. So they can stay ahead of competitors.\n\nTypes of Competitive Intelligence\n\nThere are two main types of competitive intelligence.\n\nStrategic competitive intelligence informs a business’s broad direction. It focuses on long-term objectives and actions.\n\nFor example, insights from this kind of intelligence can help companies to plan out mergers and acquisitions. Or expand into new markets.\n\nTactical competitive intelligence informs short-term decisions. It relies on real-time information, and helps businesses respond to immediate threats and opportunities. \n\nFor example, insights from this type of intelligence can help companies respond to supply chain disruptions. Or fine-tune their existing marketing campaigns.\n\nUsing both types of CI helps companies better reach their goals.\n\nHow to Do Competitive Intelligence Research\n\nLearn how to do competitive intelligence research—step by step:\n\n1. Identify Your Main Competitors\n\nConducting a competitor analysis is a central part of gathering competitive intelligence. So, you need to decide which rivals to evaluate.\n\nWe recommend focusing on the two to three companies that pose the biggest threats.\n\nThey’re not necessarily the industry giants—they’re whoever your ideal customer would opt for if your offering were unavailable.\n\nAnd don’t be tempted to focus on just one competitor. Intelligence that’s accurate and reliable needs to include at least a few rivals. \n\nThis approach yields higher-quality data. And makes analysis more manageable.\n\nThere are various ways to identify competitors with Semrush.\n\nFor example, the Competitors report in Organic Research shows which sites commonly appear alongside yours in Google results.\n\nFind Competitors\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Gather and Organize Data\n\nIn competitive intelligence, gathering relevant and reliable data is crucial. \n\nIt’s not about getting as much information as possible. It’s about collecting high-quality data that provides useful insights about your target audience, competitors, and market.\n\nLet’s say you’re an online-only business with no interest in opening a physical store. \n\nYou shouldn’t waste time gathering data about rivals’ physical locations. Instead, you should focus on collecting information about their online presence.\n\nAnd be careful where you get it.\n\nInaccurate, outdated, or incomplete data can lead you to false conclusions. And do more harm than good. \n\nFor example, if you falsely believe that a marketing channel delivers great results for a competitor, you might waste money trying to mimic their success.\n\nLater, we’ll share some of the competitive intelligence tools and resources you can use for ethical data gathering. Using a variety of techniques can help you yield the best results.\n\nWhatever methods you choose, keep your data organized. So analysis is easier.\n\nHere are some best practices to employ:\n\nUse descriptive file names, tags, and metadata to make lookups easier\nGroup data by type (e.g., folders for each competitor)\nUse spreadsheets or purpose-built tools so you can manipulate data more easily\nProvide data access to relevant decision-makers\nKeep records about your data collection methods \n3. Analyze Your Data\n\nCompetitive intelligence analysis is about transforming raw information into valuable insights.\n\nLet’s say you’ve gathered this product pricing data:\n\nCompetitor\n\n\t\n\nMonth 1\n\n\t\n\nMonth 2\n\n\t\n\nMonth 3\n\n\t\n\nMonth 4\n\n\t\n\nMonth 5\n\n\t\n\nMonth 6\n\n\n\n\nCompetitor A\n\n\t\n\n$999\n\n\t\n\n$949\n\n\t\n\n$899\n\n\t\n\n$899\n\n\t\n\n$849\n\n\t\n\n$849\n\n\n\n\nCompetitor B\n\n\t\n\n$1,049\n\n\t\n\n$1,049\n\n\t\n\n$999\n\n\t\n\n$999\n\n\t\n\n$949\n\n\t\n\n$949\n\n\n\n\nCompetitor C\n\n\t\n\n$899\n\n\t\n\n$849\n\n\t\n\n$799\n\n\t\n\n$799\n\n\t\n\n$799\n\n\t\n\n$799\n\nFrom this, you can get insights like:\n\nThe highest-ever price was $1,049\nThe average price peaked in Month 1\nCompetitor B had the highest prices in every month\n\nSome competitive intelligence tools streamline the analysis process. By making calculations and drawing conclusions for you.\n\n4. Tailor Your Business Strategy\n\nNext, you need to transform insights into a plan for action.\n\nCombine insights from competitor research, audience research, and market research to get a well-rounded view of opportunities and threats. \n\nThen, consider what you learned in the context of your business goals.\n\nFor example, you might find that there’s consumer demand for a cheaper product due to economic conditions. So you try to beat competitors’ prices while taking revenue goals into account.\n\n5. Track Results and Keep Adapting\n\nDon’t create one competitive intelligence report and rely on it forever.\n\nTo maintain business growth and success, you should regularly monitor:\n\nYour own performance metrics\nMarket trends\nCompetitor activities\nConsumer habits\n\nAnd adapt your strategy accordingly.\n\nIt’s a good idea to do this around once per month, depending on your resources. Or, use tools that send reports and alerts automatically.\n\nWith My Reports in Semrush, you can schedule performance reports on you and your competitors. \n\nJust choose one of the ready-to-use templates after setting up your project. Or start from scratch.\n\nThen, follow the instructions provided. \n\nTo create a custom report like this:\n\nWhere to Gather Competitive Intelligence\n\nThese competitive intelligence tools and sources allow you to gather valuable data:\n\nMarket Intelligence Tools\n\nMarket intelligence tools collect and analyze data from various sources to help businesses understand their target market.
