  "content": "If you’re a site owner using WordPress, chances are you’re already using Yoast SEO to optimize it. But did you know that you can use Yoast to leverage the power of Semrush, without ever needing to leave your site editor?\n\nBelow, we’ll show you how Semrush and Yoast SEO work together—and how you can use them both to boost your site’s visibility.\n\nWhat Is the Yoast SEO & Semrush Integration?\n\nIf you’re reading this, you probably already know what Yoast is—a WordPress plugin that helps you optimize your site for search engines. But what’s Semrush, and how do the two work together? \n\nFirst, Semrush.\n\nSemrush is an online SaaS platform that helps people run digital marketing campaigns more effectively. That means it can help with things like SEO, content marketing, competitive research, paid ads, and more. \n\nSemrush also has the largest keyword database on the market, with 24.7 billion keywords and counting.\n\nAnd what does all that have to do with Yoast?\n\nSimple. The Semrush integration with Yoast SEO empowers you to find high-performing keywords in Semrush’s massive database, without ever having to leave the WordPress editor to do it.\n\nWith it, you can:\n\nFind and target relevant keywords \nFind new, high-quality content ideas\nOptimize your content to rank higher\nGet more eyes on your site\n\nIn other words, together, Yoast and Semrush make keyword research easier and more effective, by providing you with the data you need, right where and when you need it. Within the site editor.\n\nConvenient, huh?\n\nNext, let’s look at how to enable the integration in WordPress.\n\nHow to Connect Semrush to Yoast SEO\n\nReady to enable Semrush in Yoast SEO? It’s simple, and only requires a few clicks.\n\nFirst, open the Yoast SEO sidebar in the WordPress Editor of any page on your website. (Don’t have Yoast yet? Learn more about how to install and use it here.)\n\nThen, enter a focus keyword, and click “Get Related Keyphrases.” \n\nThis will prompt a new window to open. Here, you have two options: \n\nLog into your existing Semrush account\nRegister for a new Semrush account\n\nThe type of Semrush account you have will determine how many keywords you can search for each day. More on that later. \n\nOnce you’ve either logged in or registered, the next step is to grant Yoast SEO permission to access your Semrush account. You should only need to do this once. \n\nGoing forward, the related keyphrases tool—and all that Semrush data—will be available to you automatically.\n\nNext, let’s learn more about what the integration can do.\n\nFeatures & Limitations\n\nWith the Yoast SEO Semrush integration, you’ll get access to Semrush’s entire 24.7 billion keyword database. And for each keyphrase you find, you’ll learn its:\n\nVolume: The average number of searches per month, based on the last 12 months of data\nTrend: How interest in that keyword changed over the last 12 months, based on its monthly search volume\n\nIt’s available on both the free and premium versions of Yoast. \n\nWhat’s the difference between using the Semrush integration on Yoast SEO free vs. premium?\n\nIn short, Yoast SEO Premium has a variety of features not available on the free version. Since we’re focusing on the Semrush integration specifically, the most relevant differences are: \n\nPremium users can use the tool to target up to 5 keyphrases per post, whereas free users can only target one \nPremium users can target up to five related keyphrase using the “Add as related keyphrase” button, and get recommendations about them from the tool\n\nNow for the Semrush side of things. The number of keyphrases you can find each day varies depending on your Semrush account type. Here’s how it breaks down:\n\nSemrush Account Type\n\n\t\n\nNumber of Keyphrase Searches Per Day\n\n\t\n\nResults Per Search\n\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\t\n\n10\n\n\t\n\n10\n\n\n\n\nPro\n\n\t\n\n3,000\n\n\t\n\n10,000\n\n\n\n\nGuru\n\n\t\n\n5,000\n\n\t\n\n30,000\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\t\n\n10,000\n\n\t\n\n50,000\n\nThese limitations apply both on Yoast SEO and within the main Semrush interface. So, if you’re already an avid Semrush user, be aware that each keyphrase search on Yoast SEO will also count toward your daily limit.\n\nYou can find out more about Semrush pricing and limitations here. \n\nGetting Started with Yoast and Semrush\n\nBy now, you’ve connected your Semrush account to Yoast SEO. It’s time to dive in and start optimizing.\n\nFirst, open any page or post on your site in your WordPress editor—or create a new one. Then, open Yoast SEO in the sidebar.\n\nAt the top of the sidebar, you’ll see a field called “Focus keyphrase.” \n\nA focus keyphrase, or focus keyword, is the primary search term you want that page to rank for. It should also accurately describe the contents of that page. \n\nStart by entering your focus keyphrase for that page. \n\nNot sure what your focus keyphrase should be? Don’t worry. Just enter your page’s main topic for now. You can replace it later.\n\nNext, click “Find Related Keyphrases.” \n\nSince you’ve already connected your Semrush account, you should automatically see the Related Keyphrases window, containing a list of search terms related to your focus keyphrase. \n\nNow, it’s time to choose your target keyphrases. \n\nFirst, use the drop-down to select the country you want to rank for. Then choose keyphrases you want this page to target:\n\nIf you need a new focus keyphrase, make a note of the best one, and update Yoast SEO accordingly once you leave the Related Keyphrases tool.\nIf you’re a Yoast SEO Premium user, click “Add related keyphrase” for up to five additional search terms\nIf you’re using the free version, make a note of the ones you want to target and try to integrate them into your content later\n\nNow let’s look at how to choose effective keyphrases to target.\n\nHow to Choose Effective Focus and Related Keyphrases\n\nFirst, let’s examine the keyphrases themselves. You probably see two different types: \n\nShort-tail keywords are only one or two words. They usually have a very high search volume, and cover a very general or high level topic, like “bicycles.” As such, they’re usually hard to rank for, especially for a new site.\nLong-tail keywords usually consist of multiple words, as in “how to choose a mountain bike for beginners.” They are typically much more specific, and less competitive by comparison.\n\nStart by identifying any keyword that accurately describes the contents of your page. \n\nNext, we’ll use Volume and Trend data to narrow the list down. \n\nAs described above, search volume is the average number of times that phrase is searched for each month. The higher this number, the more popular—and the larger your potential audience. And the trend graph shows you how that popularity has changed over time. If the line is going down, fewer people are searching. \n\nSo how do we use this data? Simple. \n\nFirst, eliminate any keywords that you believe are too low in volume to compete for. If you’re not sure, take a look at the trend. For example, if a low volume keyword is consistently trending down, you may think it’s not worth your time.\n\nNext, look at the highest-volume keyphrases on your list. One strategy is to simply target all of the highest volume keyphrases, because they have the highest potential audience. \n\nHowever, the more popular a keyword, the harder it probably is to rank for. \n\nThat’s why it’s helpful to first analyze your focus keyphrases using Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool. Find it by clicking the “Get more insights at Semrush” link at the bottom of the Related Keyphrases window. \n\nThis will open the Keyword Overview tool in the main Semrush platform, showing data for your current focus keyphrase.\n\nHere, you can learn: \n\nHow difficult it is to rank\nIts search intent (informational, commercial, or transactional)\nRelated keywords and questions to target\nYour biggest competitors to rank\nOther features that appear on the search page (like featured snippets, or People Also Ask boxes)\n\nUsing what you learn, eliminate any keyphrases you don’t think are worth targeting, whether they’re too difficult, too low volume, or not relevant enough. \n\nYou should be left with a shorter list of workable keyphrases. \n\nChoose the best one for your focus keyword, if you haven’t already settled on one. Then, choose up to five more to support it. These are your related keyphrases.\n\nA related keyphrase, also called a supporting, tertiary, or secondary keyword, is an additional word or phrase you want to rank for, but which is lower priority than your focus keyphrase. Often, these are variations or subtopics of your primary keyword.\n\nIf you’re using Yoast SEO Premium, the tool will help you target these supporting keywords in your content, similar to how it provides recommendations for your focus keyword.\n\nUsing the free version? Don’t worry. You can still target related keyphrases by integrating them thoughtfully into your content—for example, in relevant subheaders, or throughout the text. \n\nHow to Find New Opportunities to Rank in Search Results\n\nKeyword research can uncover plenty of opportunities for your site to rank well in organic search results. Not sure where to start? Here are four key considerations.\n\nLow-Hanging Fruit Keywords\n\nIt may be tempting to exclusively target the highest volume, most competitive keywords available, because they have the biggest audience. And if you do win, this could pay off in spades.\n\nBut—especially if you’re building a new site, or are competing in a crowded niche—those wins might be a long way off, and may require strenuous effort.\n\nThat’s where low-hanging fruit comes in.\n\nIn this context, low-hanging fruit refers to keyphrases that, although they may have low search volume, are easy to win with relatively little effort. \n\nWhy target them? Here are just a few reasons: \n\nRanking for more keywords can help build your site’s credibility over time—even if they’re low volume or low competition ones\nThey can still bring relevant traffic to your site\nQuick wins like these can balance out more difficult keyword goals\nRelated Topics\n\nHere’s a familiar scenario: You’re doing keyword research, and you find an interesting keyword, with good search volume, and not too much competition. But you can’t use it, because it isn’t quite accurate to the content you’re creating. \n\nOr can you?\n\nBuilding out a library of related content about a topic can help to build your site’s subject-matter authority. And that authority can help you rank for even harder keywords in the future. \n\nLearn more about this strategy in our article about topic clusters.\n\nNeed more related content ideas ASAP? Semrush can help. Just enter your main topic into the Keyword Overview tool, and scroll down to the “Keyword Ideas” section. \n\nEach question or keyword variation is a potential topic you could cover on your site. \n\nSearch Intent\n\nIf you want your content to rank, make sure it aligns with its target keyword’s intent.\n\nWhat is search intent?\n\nSearch intent is the purpose behind a user’s query. In other words, it refers to the type of information a user is trying to find.\n\nThere are four basic types:\n\nInformational: The user wants to learn about a topic (“types of dog food”)\nCommercial: The user is investigating a potential purchase, but isn’t ready to buy yet (“the best dog food brands”)\nTransactional: The user is trying to make a purchase right now (“blue buffalo life protection small breed”)\nNavigational: the user is trying to get somewhere—an address, a website, a phone number, etc. (“contact purina”)\n\nSearch engines use intent to determine which content and features to show in the results. So if your page is misaligned with what they think users want, they’re unlikely to rank it.\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Overview tool shows you the Search Intent for any phrase.\n\nBy aligning your page contents with the search intent behind your focus keyphrase, you won’t just increase your odds of ranking higher. You’ll also ensure that your content is both relevant and helpful for your audience.\n\nSERP Features\n\nSERP features, also called “search features,” are elements of a search results page.\n\nHave you ever asked a question on Google, only to find the answer conveniently displayed in a box at the top of the results? That’s just one example of a search feature. \n\nWinning one of these can boost your site’s visibility significantly. After all, when was the last time you scrolled past one to click on a lower-ranked result?\n\nSemrush can help you identify keyphrases currently displaying SERP features. Using the Keyword Magic tool, you can even filter for the ones you want to target.\n\nSo how do you target them? Short answer: it depends on the type you want to target.\n\nGenerally speaking, the key is to make sure all your content is helpful, relevant, and easy to understand for humans and search engine crawlers alike. \n\nFor more specific hints, try learning from your competition. Which page currently owns the feature you’re after? Analyze that page to learn how they won. \n\nFor example, let’s say your biggest competitor won the featured snippet you want. By viewing the page, you find that they: \n\nUsed easy-to-understand, topical headers related to pertinent questions\nAnswered each question right underneath each header, with minimal fluff\nUsed charts and bullet points to organize their data for easy reading\nLink to authoritative sources\n\nYou can replicate all of these strategies while creating and optimizing unique content for your audience. \n\nLearn more in our article on winning SERP features.\n\nSemrush and Yoast SEO: A Perfect Match\n\nBetween the power of Semrush and Yoast SEO, you’ve got all the resources you need to rank at your fingertips.
