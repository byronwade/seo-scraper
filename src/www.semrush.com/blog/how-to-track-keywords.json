  "content": "Keyword tracking involves monitoring and measuring the performance of specific keywords or phrases. It helps you understand how well your website ranks for those keywords, how often the keywords are searched on average, and more.\n\nIf you’re not tracking keywords, you’re missing an opportunity to measure whether your website has online visibility for topics that could bring you business.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll cover the concept and benefits of keyword tracking, how to track keyword performance step by step, and tracking tools to consider.\n\nWhy Keyword Tracking Is Essential for SEO Success\n\nKeyword tracking is a crucial component of any SEO strategy. It informs your decisions and influences the following:\n\nVisibility\nVisibility refers to how often your website or pages appear in search engine results for keywords\nBy tracking keywords, you gain insights into how visible your content is (i.e., how well your content ranks) on search engine results pages (SERPs)\nImproved visibility means more chances for people to discover your business when they search for topics related to your offerings\nRankings\nKeyword tracking allows you to monitor the search engine rankings of individual keywords, arming you with data to help you decide which ones to focus your optimization efforts on\nBy tracking keywords, you’ll know which pages on your site rank for them. You might optimize existing content or decide to create new content that better aligns with what people are searching for.\nRegularly tracking and monitoring helps you understand which keywords are gaining or losing positioning in search results, so you can make timely adjustments to your content\nTraffic\nTracking keywords is the basis for measuring your search rankings, which directly affect organic traffic. \nHigher rankings can lead to more visits. The top three Google results receive 54.4% of all clicks.\nBy tracking keywords, you’ll be able to identify which terms drive the most traffic and conversions to your site. You can then optimize your site to improve performance and attract the right type of visitors.\nThe Benefits of Keyword Tracking for Website Optimization\n\nKeyword tracking plays a key role in website optimization. Here are some of the benefits that enhance your SEO strategy.\n\nImproved Targeting\nKeyword research and analysis help you center your content around relevant topics that matter to your target audience\nWhen your content aligns with what people are searching for, you capture their attention\nBy tracking keywords, you’ll learn which terms attract people who are genuinely interested in your offerings\nBetter Content Relevance\nRegular keyword tracking ensures your content stays relevant\nAs your industry evolves, you can track new keywords and update your content to align with changing user expectations\nIdentifying the best keywords for your content, and then using them to optimize your content can directly affect your rankings\nBy tracking keywords and understanding their intent, you can optimize your site to address your potential customers’ needs\nEnhanced User Experience\nWhen your content aligns with search intent, user satisfaction improves. “Intent” is what the user intends to do for the search they’ve entered.\nRelevant keywords lead to better-targeted content, which can lead to higher engagement\nHow Keyword Tracking Works\n\nThe primary goals of keyword tracking are to compare keyword performance, identify growth opportunities, and inform your content strategy.\n\nGoogle uses complex algorithms to rank web pages based on keyword relevance, content quality, backlinks, and user experience.\n\nMany keyword tracking tools consider these factors. One such tool is Semrush’s Position Tracking, which allows you to monitor your site's rankings. You can get daily data for rankings of the keywords you’ve tracked, sites that are competing for your target keywords, rankings in different locations, and more.\n\nThis is an example of what one of the reports in the Position Tracking tool looks like:\n\nTrack Your Rankings\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Track Keywords Step by Step\n\nHere’s how to track keyword rankings for your website, from initial research to setting up a tracking tool.\n\nStep 1: Conduct Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research is the process of discovering and analyzing terms and topics your target audience is looking for.\n\nHere are a few ways to identify keywords.\n\nLook at Google Search Autocomplete and Related Searches\n\nAn easy, free method of researching keywords is to go to Google and look at the autocomplete options it offers in the search bar.\n\nGoogle generates these to help people save time and quickly complete their searches. The predictions reflect real, common search queries.\n\nYou’ll see the predictions populate when you start typing. Make note of any that are relevant for your site.\n\nWhen you enter a query in Google, scroll down and you’ll eventually come to a “Related searches” section. These are keywords related to your search that you might also consider targeting.\n\nCheck to See What You Already Rank for\n\nAnother free keyword research method is using Google Search Console (GSC).\n\nAssuming you have an existing website, you can check to see whether it’s ranking for any keywords.\n\nLog in to GSC, set up your property if you haven’t done so previously, and go to “Search results” in the left-hand navigation.\n\nThen select all four colored boxes for clicks, impressions, average click-through rate (CTR), and average position.\n\nScroll down and you’ll see a table with queries that your site ranks for in Google, and their corresponding four metrics.\n\nNow you can add these keywords to your tracking tool.\n\nFurther reading: How to Use Google Search Console for Keyword Research\n\nUse a Keyword Research Tool to Discover Opportunities\n\nThe Semrush Keyword Magic Tool uses a database of more than 25 billion keywords, providing keyword suggestions and important metrics.\n\nStart by entering a seed keyword relevant to your business. \n\nChoose your target country or leave “US” as the default selection.\n\nThen click the “Search” button.\n\nYou’ll then see a list of related keywords, along with corresponding key metrics like search intent, search volume, and keyword difficulty. You can apply filters to narrow your search for targeting.\n\nWhen you’ve decided which keywords you want to target from that list, use the checkboxes and then click the “+ Add to keyword list” button to save them to the Keyword Strategy Builder. \n\nIf you’ve already created a keyword list, you can choose the list you’d like to add the keywords to. \n\nOr, you can create a new list by clicking “Create new empty list” and typing in a name for the list. Then click the green check mark, and you’re done.\n\nThe alternative to saving them to the Keyword Strategy Builder is to select the keywords, and then export them to an XLSX or CSV file. You can build a list on your personal drive and upload everything to Keyword Strategy Builder later.\n\nTo discover more keywords for other topics, go back to the first step of using the Keyword Magic Tool to enter another seed keyword. \n\nSelect the keywords you want, then click \"Export.\"\n\nOnce you’ve compiled a list and you’re ready to upload to Keyword Strategy Builder, go to the tool and click “create a regular list.” Give it a name and then click “Create list.”\n\nTo upload your keywords, click the blue “Add keywords” button in the top right of the screen. A window will appear like this, with a field to paste your list.\n\nStep 2: Interpret and Analyze Keyword Data\n\nUnderstanding the data you collect for your keywords is just as important as tracking the keywords.\n\nIf you’re tracking keywords with Semrush, you’ll see key metrics like intent, keyword difficulty, position, volume, and more.\n\nIntent\n\nThis is the type of intent—navigational, informational, commercial, or transactional—that searchers have for the keyword.\n\nFor example, the intent for “home decoration ideas for wall” is informational, which means the searcher is looking for information and isn't likely to make a purchase or convert in another way, like sign up for a newsletter.\n\nOn the other hand, the intent for “best home décor catalogs” is commercial, which means the searcher is in a research phase and could be close to buying.\n\nDifficulty\n\nKeyword difficulty is a metric that measures how competitive the term or phrase is, and therefore, how hard it may be to rank for it.\n\nFor example, “best home décor brands” has a keyword difficulty score of 22%, which suggests it should be easy to rank for.\n\nOn the other hand, “home decoration ideas for wall” has a difficulty score of 71%, which means it’s more competitive.\n\nPosition\n\nThis is your website’s ranking for the keyword in the SERP.\n\nIt should be your goal to rank as high as possible on the first page of results for any given target keyword.\n\nIn general, the higher you rank for a keyword, the more traffic you can get. CTRs of search results increase the higher the position is.\n\nVolume\n\nSearch volume is the average number of monthly searches over the last 12 months for the keyword.\n\nFor example, “best home décor brands” has a volume of 70, so you might only expect a fraction of that in terms of visits if you can get a top ranking.\n\nOn the other hand, “home decoration ideas for wall” has a volume of 320, which could bring relatively more traffic.\n\nStep 3: Determine Keyword Competition and Search Volume\n\nYou can assess the viability of keywords by analyzing their competition levels and search volumes.\n\nIn this example using the Semrush Keyword Overview tool, the keyword “yoga mat” has a keyword difficulty of 72% on a scale of 0-100%. It will be hard to rank for.\n\nBy solely targeting keywords that are hard to rank for, you may not get the results you expect.\n\nAnd by solely targeting keywords that are easy to rank for, you could be missing out on significant traffic. Find a balance that makes sense for your business.\n\nSearch volume is another metric to analyze in your research. It’s a metric that SEO tools provide to help you determine a keyword's popularity. For example, “dog food” has around 135,000 monthly searches in the United States.\n\nUsing high-volume keywords to optimize your site—such as a popular keyword like “dog food”—can bring significant traffic. However, high-volume terms are competitive.\n\nLow-volume keywords, on the other hand, aren’t as popular. A keyword like “all-natural lamb and rice dog food,” gets just 10 searches per month, and is less competitive.\n\nStep 4: Select Keywords for Tracking\n\nA well-rounded SEO strategy balances head terms, medium-tail keywords, and long-tail keywords.\n\nHead terms, also referred to as “short-tail keywords,” are broad keywords with high volume relative to other keywords in the given topic.\n\nFor example, “sneakers” is a head term with a volume of 201,000.\n\n“Men's Nike wide sneakers,” on the other hand, is a long-tail keyword that gets considerably fewer searches per month: 320.\n\nLong-tail keywords are queries with high specificity that tend to have relatively low search volumes.\n\nDespite the low volume, they make up 70% of all Google searches.\n\nMedium-tail keywords are more specific than head terms but aren’t necessarily as specific as long-tail keywords. \n\nThey can help attract more qualified traffic to a website compared to head terms, which are often broad and difficult to rank for.\n\nCombine the strengths of all three types of keywords. Balance them in your targeting to ensure that you cater to different intents and aren’t relying solely on one type of keyword.\n\nFor example, head terms can often indicate the searcher is simply looking for information. You might create content about the history of sneakers.\n\nMedium- and long-tail keywords, on the other hand, may indicate people are looking to buy. You might create a page for a sneaker sizing chart that accounts for wide sizes you sell.\n\nWith this balanced strategy, you’re working to attract searchers of all types and build a larger audience.\n\nStep 5: Map Your Keywords\n\nKeyword mapping involves strategically assigning relevant keywords to specific pages to improve their visibility and ranking.\n\nThe goal is to match each target keyword with a page on your site that best satisfies search intent. By doing this, you can optimize pages for the most relevant terms and prevent keyword cannibalization.\n\nA keyword map looks something like this:\n\nTo start the process, check out Keyword Mapping for SEO and download the Semrush keyword mapping template.\n\nDownload the Keyword Mapping Template\n\nGet Template →\nStep 6: Set Up Semrush Position Tracking Tool\n\nTo track rankings for your target keywords, you can use the Semrush Position Tracking tool.\n\nTo begin the setup, enter your domain and then click the “Set up tracking” button.\n\nBefore making selections in this next step, look at your website analytics to see:\n\nWhich search engine drives the most traffic to your site\nAnd which device type most of your visitors use - desktop, mobile, or tablet\n\nNext, with those two answers in hand, choose the search engine and device you want Semrush to use for tracking. You might start with “Google” and “Mobile,” respectively.\n\nYou also need to choose a location, so choose the main country your business sells to.\n\nThen click the “Continue To Keywords” button.\n\nThe next stage is to manually enter your target keyword list, or import it from another source, such as a TXT or CSV file.\n\nOnce you’ve done this, click “Add keywords to campaign” and then click the “Start Tracking” button.\n\nWatch this short video for a demonstration of the steps we just covered:\n\nYou’ll then see a dashboard with a variety of reports. The default view shows overall landscape metrics and a summary about the domain.\n\nNavigate to the “Overview” tab to see metrics for the keywords you set up.\n\nIn this report, scroll down and you’ll see the “Rankings Overview.”\n\nThis lists your keywords, their rankings, and how they’ve changed position over time.\n\nHow to Track Keywords in Search Console\n\nYou can also analyze your site’s performance for keywords in GSC, a free tool.\n\nLog in to the tool. If you haven’t set up your property yet, you can learn how in Google Search Console: The Ultimate Guide.\n\nIn the property drop-down, choose your domain.\n\nTo see what keywords your site ranks for, click “Full report” on the “Performance” chart on the overview page..\n\nOr you can click “Search Results” in the left-hand menu to get to the same place.\n\nThe report shows a line chart with clicks, impressions, average CTR, and average position over the last three months.\n\nTo see the keywords your site ranks for, scroll down to the table of “Top queries.” These are your ranking keywords along with the corresponding metrics in the line chart above.\n\nTo see whether you rank for a particular keyword, scroll back up and click “+ New” to filter by query.\n\nA box like this will appear. Select “Exact query” in the drop-down, enter the keyword you want to see data for, and click “Apply.”\n\nIf you don’t see any data for the keyword you entered, it means your site doesn’t rank for it.\n\nIf your site does rank for the keyword, you’ll see something like this:\n\nWant to focus solely on the ranking? Click the blue, purple, and green boxes so only the orange “Average position” block stays selected.\n\nThis shows you the keyword’s ranking every day over time. The default time frame is the last three months, and you can change this as desired.\n\nWhile you can’t build a list in GSC like you can in Semrush Position Tracking, you can still export GSC data to your computer for further tracking. You could create your own charts and tables in Excel, for example.\n\nGSC data is only available for 16 months, so you may consider exporting on a regular basis to save keyword data for the long run.\n\nTrack Keywords for Different Platforms\n\nThere’s more to keyword tracking than just Google search.\n\nIf you’re marketing your business on various platforms, you may want to track keyword performance on all of them for a holistic view of your online presence.\n\nHere are strategies for tracking keywords for a few other popular platforms.\n\nGoogle Ads Keyword Position Tracking\n\nRunning PPC ads with your Google Ads account? You can use the Position Tracking tool again to see and track performance for the keywords you’re bidding on.\n\nOpen the tool and select the project you created in step six of the keyword tracking process above.\n\nIn the default view of the dashboard, click the settings icon that looks like a gear in the top-right corner. Under “Type” select “Google Ads.”\n\nAll the data you see now is for the keywords you’re bidding on in your Google Ads campaigns.\n\nNavigate to the “Overview” tab and scroll down to “Rankings Overview.”\n\nClick the “Positions” tab to see which keywords your ads rank for and their position.\n\nYouTube Keyword Position Tracking\n\nIf you have a YouTube channel, you can use Semrush's Rank Tracker for YouTube to measure the position of your videos in YouTube results for your target keywords.\n\nTo use this app, go to the App Center that’s listed in the Semrush main navigation. \n\nYou can then either search “YouTube” to find the tracker, or click “Social Media” in the left-hand menu to see all the social media apps where the tracker is listed.\n\nHere’s how to track keywords for YouTube.\n\nInside the Rank Tracker app, connect to your YouTube channel. Then import your list of target keywords either manually, via YouTube Studio, or via Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder.\n\nOnce the setup is done, the “Overview” tab will show you:\n\nThe average YouTube ranking across all your keywords\nThe distribution of rankings—”Top 3,” “Top 10,” “Top 20,” and “No Rank”\nThe number of keywords that moved up or down in position\nA snapshot of your top ranking keywords in the “Top Ranking Keywords” section\n\nFor more keyword insights, navigate to the “Keywords” tab.\n\nHere, you’ll see rankings for each of your keywords and the corresponding ranking video.\n\nAmazon Position Tracking\n\nIf you have an Amazon seller account, you can use a tool like Helium 10’s Amazon & Walmart Keyword Tracker to track the rankings of your Amazon keywords.\n\nYou can get the organic and sponsored Amazon positions of your keywords in real-time, gather data like trends and monthly searches, and see how your visibility compares to competitors.\n\nVisit Helium 10’s tracker tool page to learn how to track keyword ranking in Amazon.\n\nOther Tools for Keyword Tracking\n\nAdditional keyword tracking tools are available.
