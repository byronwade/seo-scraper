Plus which platform to choose to reach more of your target audience with better ROI.\n\nWhat Are Advertising Platforms?\n\nAdvertising platforms are digital spaces where businesses display paid ads to promote their products or services to a targeted customer base. \n\nPlatforms range from social media networks and search engines to websites and apps. Each offers various ad formats and targeting options to reach potential customers effectively. We’ll cover the main ones later in this section.\n\nUse digital advertising platforms to increase your business's visibility, drive website traffic, and boost sales.\n\nFor example, a local bakery could use social media advertising on Facebook to reach interested users from a specific geographic area. \n\nImage Source: Meta Ad Library\n\nCompelling ads can attract new customers, promote special offers, increase in-person traffic to a physical store, and more.\n\nFocusing on a qualified audience allows you to allocate your marketing budget more efficiently.\n\nFurther reading: Paid Advertising 101: A Beginner’s Guide\n\nHow Do Advertising Platforms Work?\n\nAdvertising platforms operate through three main components that enable you to reach your target audience more successfully. \n\nAd auctions: Occur in real time when an advertising slot becomes available. Advertisers bid on slots based on the value they assign to them, often determined by keywords, audience demographics, or the platform itself. The highest bidder, or sometimes the bidder providing the most value considering both bid amount and ad quality, wins the ad slot.\nTargeting options: Ensure ads reach the most relevant audience. You can segment audiences based on demographics, interests, and behaviors. For example, a fitness equipment store can target individuals interested in health and fitness, fine-tuned by age, geographic location, or recent search history related to workout gear.\nTypes of ads: Include text ads, display ads, video ads, and interactive ads. Choosing a format depends on your campaign goals, product or service, and where your target audience spends time online. For instance, a video ad might be more effective on a platform like YouTube. Whereas a text ad could perform better in Google’s search engine result pages (SERPs).\n\nImagine a small business launches a new product and uses an advertising platform to promote it.\n\nThe business sets a budget and bids for (video) ad slots on a social media network like Instagram, targeting users who have expressed interest in similar products\nThe advertising platform displays its ad to targeted users\nThe platform's algorithms optimize the ad's delivery. Ensuring it reaches individuals most likely to engage based on their past online behavior and preferences.\nInterested users engage with the ad and perform a desired action.
