  "content": "To compete in today’s highly competitive markets, it’s essential to keep your finger on the pulse of what's going on in your industry.\n\nWell-conducted market research will help you with that. \n\nIn this article, we’ll explore:\n\nWhat market research is and why it's important\nDifferent market research types and methods\nHow to do market research\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nWhat Is Market Research?\n\nMarket research is the process of gathering and analyzing information about your business's target market. The main goal is to discover who your customers are and what they want. \n\nMarket research helps you answer questions like the following: \n\nWhat are the demographics of my target audience? \nWhat are their interests and buying habits? \nWhat do they think about my business or industry? \nWhat problems can I help this group of people solve? \nHow can I best connect with them? \n\nMarket research analysis is more than simply tracking numbers. It goes one step further by attempting to uncover the “why” behind the numbers.\n\nWhy Should You Do Market Research?\n\nUnderstanding your target audience allows you to:\n\nIdentify business opportunities\nAttract a loyal customer base\nFind out what influences buying behavior\nVerify the success of a product\nUnderstand your brand perception\n\nAll of these things contribute to a healthy business plan and robust marketing strategy. \n\nWhen Should You Conduct Market Research? \n\nMarket research can take up time and resources. Be strategic about when you conduct your research studies.\n\nHere are four times when you should consider conducting market research:\n\nBefore launching a new business or venture: Initial market research helps you uncover competing products, pricing structures, and marketing efforts of your competitors \nBefore entering new markets: It’s crucial to understand your potential customers in new markets. Economic shifts, emerging trends, and cultural values differ from place to place. Market research helps you avoid costly mistakes.\nBefore developing or launching new products or services: As your company grows, you’ll likely roll out new products and/or services. You’ll want to understand the market conditions before making any big moves. \nAfter any of the above: After launching a new business, entering new markets, or releasing new products or services, conduct follow-up research. This will help you determine what’s working and what needs work.\n\nBesides the above situations, you should always keep an eye on trends and industry developments. Markets and customers are always changing. It’s important to stay informed. \n\nFurther reading: How to Define Your Target Audience\n\nTypes of Market Research\n\nBefore conducting market research, consider what insights you’re looking for:\n\nAre you trying to understand your competitors?\nDo you want to better market your products?\nLooking to address a customer pain point?\n\nThere are two main types of market research to address these questions: primary market research and secondary market research.\n\nPrimary Market Research \n\nPrimary market research brings you close to the action. You do it yourself, usually up close and personal with the subject of the research.\n\nFor example, primary research methods can include: \n\nFocus groups \nInterviews\nObservation-based research (like in-person observation)\n\nThese research methods allow you to collect two types of data: \n\nQualitative data: Descriptive data you cannot express in numbers. Examples include people's preferences, dislikes, and emotional responses. Interviews and discussion groups typically produce qualitative data.\nQuantitative data: Number-based data, including page views and social media follows. You usually present this kind of data in charts and graphs. \nSecondary Market Research \n\nSecondary market research refers to third-party data you collect from public or private records that are not your own. Because the data is already available, it’s typically more cost-effective. And less resource-intensive. \n\nHere are some examples of secondary sources:\n\nCompany reports: Company-created reports about their own businesses (e.g., company websites, investor relation websites, Yahoo Finance, Google Finance)\nIndustry statistics: Information and data on entire industries, as opposed to single companies (e.g., Statista, Pew, Gartner, Forrester)\nWhite papers: Authoritative market analysis written by third parties about a specific topic related to a given industry (e.g., trade magazines, market research companies)\nGovernment agency data: Government-collected data shared with the general public (e.g., Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census data, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)\n\nSecondary sources provide a macro-level view of your industry, plus insights about other competitors in the market. Just make sure the data and insights are accurate and reliable by using reputable sources.\n\nMarket Research Methods \n\nThe best market research method depends on what you’re trying to understand about your market. Of course, you can combine multiple methods to get a more comprehensive view.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of recommended methods based on your market research goal:\n\nWhat are you researching?\n\n\t\n\nRecommended research methods\n\n\n\n\nCustomer needs, wants, and pain points\n\n\t\nInterviews\nFocus groups\nSurveys\nObservational research\nMarket segmentation and demographics\n\n\n\nMarket trends and opportunities\n\n\t\nCompetitive analysis\nSecondary market research data\nFocus groups\nMarket segmentation and demographics\n\n\n\nBusiness performance and marketing efforts\n\n\t\nCompetitive analysis\nInterviews\nFocus groups\nSurveys\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at seven popular market research methods.\n\nInterviews\n\nInterviews allow for in-depth discussions with people from your target audience. They can be free-flowing and unstructured. Or structured and detailed. \n\nBefore conducting an interview, think about what kind of information you need and develop a list of questions.\n\nHere are examples of questions you can ask to address specific areas of business:\n\nCustomer pain points: What are the main issues you face with X?\nCustomer goals: What are you looking for in X?\nBrand awareness: Have you heard of X?\nBrand preferences: Do you prefer X over Y? Why?\nPricing: How much would you pay for X?\nCustomer interests and behavior: How do you spend your free time?\n\nNote: While you can record interviews to help record the data, keep in mind that recording can influence people’s answers.\n\nCompetitive Analysis \n\nCompetitive analysis is the process of researching your competitors’ products, services, prices, promotions, and other activities. \n\nBy analyzing competitors, you can avoid their mistakes, replicate their success, and stay on the cutting edge of your industry. \n\nTo do that, try a competitor analysis tool like Market Explorer.\n\nAfter entering your domain and your competitors’ domains, you'll get a complete overview of your market (including its size, traffic, and consolidation). Plus detailed information about your top competitors.\n\nThe tool provides information about your competitors' traffic generation strategies, audience, and top keywords. Use this data to benchmark what success will look like for your business. \n\nNote: Learn more by reading our detailed guide to competitive analysis (with a template).\n\nFocus Groups\n\nFocus groups are group interviews where participants can test your product, provide feedback, answer questions, etc.\n\nThey allow you to get insights into your target audience in a way that would not be possible with other methods.\n\nFocus groups typically consist of five to 10 people who represent your target audience. Sessions are typically recorded.\n\nLook for the following when you review the data:\n\nRepeated words or phrases \nSimilar reactions (confusion, frustration, delight) \nInconsistent reactions or outlying opinions \nQuotes that capture the essence of the group’s feelings, reactions, and opinions \n\nCollect the data in a spreadsheet so you can organize and categorize it later for deeper analysis.\n\nMarket Segmentation\n\nMarket segmentation is the process of breaking your market’s audience into groups. There are many ways to segment your audience, but here are a few examples:\n\nDemographic information (e.g., age, gender, or location) \nSocioeconomic factors (e.g., household income and employment status)\nPsychographic aspects (e.g., interests, desires, and preferences) \n\nThinking about your market audience in categories allows you to better understand how to meet their needs and make sure your marketing efforts are impactful.\n\nTo unveil demographic, socioeconomic, and psychographic data for any market audience, use Semrush’s .Trends tool set.\n\nFor example, Market Explorer can provide a lot of information about your competitors’ audience. (Or nearly any audience in the market.)\n\nLet’s use Nike as an example to see what we can learn about their target market audience. This “Audience” report reflects data from the top sites in Nike’s market. \n\nA quick look at the data shows important information about Nike’s target market audience.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe audience is relatively evenly split between male and female, with the 25 to 34 years of age category being the largest segment \nA majority of the audience prefers YouTube as their social media platform of choice \nNike’s target market audience is predominantly interested in retail sites \n\nThis information lets us make educated guesses about what products our audience might be looking for. And market those products on platforms where this demographic spends the most time. \n\nNext, turn to the One2Target tool to gather additional data about a specific competitor’s audience. \n\nFor example, here’s the “Socioeconomics” report for nike.com. \n\nIt includes information about the audience's household size and income level, employment status, education level, and much more.\n\nHere are some insights we've gathered about Nike’s target market audience: \n\nThe majority of Nike’s audience lives in households of three or four people, which indicates Nike is popular among families \nMost of Nike’s customers fall into the middle- or low-income level \nThe majority of Nike’s audience works full-time, but it’s interesting to notice that a sizable segment of the audience are homemakers \nOver 90% of the audience has graduated from high school or gone to college \n\nThis additional information helps you create buyer personas—profile depictions of your ideal customers. So you can target marketing campaigns more effectively.\n\nYou can use our free buyer persona templates. Your final buyer persona profile will look something like this:\n\nAll of this helps you target your campaigns more effectively by offering messages your customers relate to, in a language they understand, about products they want and can afford.\n\nFurther reading: Market Segmentation, Website Demographics\n\nDiscover Competitive And Market Benchmarks\n\nwith Market Explorer\n\nTry It Now →\nSecondary Market Research Data \n\nMarket reports, white papers, and consumer rating sites provide useful data for your business. The same is true of organizations like Pew, Gartner, Ipsos, and Forrester.\n\nFor reviews and ratings, rely on sites like G2 and Trustpilot. They show insights into customer experience and satisfaction with your company and your competitors. \n\nHere's an example of Semrush's G2 review page:\n\nNote: Keep in mind that customers often write reviews when they are extremely satisifed or extremely dissatisfied with a product, so this data may skew in either direction.\n\nObservation-Based Research\n\nObservation-based research involves watching people from your target audience interact with products, services, marketing assets, etc. \n\nThe way they react, ask questions, hit roadblocks, and respond in other ways provides useful information about how to improve. \n\nFor example, you might invite participants to your office to watch them:\n\nNavigate through your website\nPurchase a product through your online store\nEngage with a physical product \n\nYou may notice they get lost, enjoy something particular, or get frustrated at a certain point. This data provides insights for improvements. \n\nSurveys \n\nSurveys allow you to connect with your audience and receive direct feedback. Conduct online surveys to reach a large number of participants and get answers quickly.\n\nServices like SurveyMonkey and Google Forms provide survey templates, distribution tools, and data organization and display options. Some social media platforms also allow you to survey your audience. \n\nHere's an example of a simple poll conducted by Semrush on LinkedIn: \n\nSurveys allow you to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. Provide a variety of question types—multiple choice, “yes or no,” short answer, and scales—to engage your audience and provide a wide variety of useful data points. \n\nHow to Do Market Research (Step by Step)\n\nNow it’s time to make a market research plan for your business.\n\nHere’s how to conduct market research in five steps:\n\nDefine the Focus of Your Research\nDevelop a Marketing Research Plan \nCollect Data \nAnalyze Data and Generate Insights \nPresent Your Findings and Continue Testing \n\nTo walk you through the process, we’ll follow a fictional footwear company seeking to break into the running shoe market.\n\nStep 1: Define the Focus of Your Research \n\nBefore you begin collecting data, narrow the focus of your research. This allows you to choose the right methods and tools.\n\nYou may choose to focus on one of the following:\n\nA specific question you need to answer to create more effective marketing campaigns\nMarket opportunities you want to explore further\nSpecific topics your target audience seems interested in\n\nUse your initial observations or questions to determine what issue or topic you want to focus on.\n\nThen do some general research to get an idea of your audience's thoughts, preferences, and pain points.\n\nThis can be as simple as conducting keyword research with a tool like Semrush's Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nType in the seed keyword (any general keyword related to your niche or product), choose the target country, and click “Search.”\n\nOur footwear company launching a new shoe line might choose “running shoes.”\n\nYou'll get a list of keyword suggestions:\n\nThen, switch the search criteria from “All” keywords to “Questions.”\n\nThis will help us explore the most common questions people have about running shoes. \n\nThe top searches revealed some consistent themes: \n\nHow long do running shoes last?\nWhen should you replace your running shoes? \nWhat are the best running shoes? \n\nWe can narrow down the results to only see keywords with commercial search intent. These are keywords people use when researching a product before making a purchase.\n\nTo do so, select “Commercial” in the “Intent” filter at the top. \n\nThis initial search provides some ideas about where to focus our research. \n\nFor the sake of this example, let’s explore what running shoes consumers think are the best and why. \n\nGet Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nStep 2: Develop a Market Research Plan \n\nAfter you determine your research goals, develop a plan to get more data. \n\nStart by answering some basic questions about methods you could use. \n\nPrimary source methods:\n\nWill you interview key individuals? \nWill you hold a focus group? \nCould you survey people about their experiences? \n\nSecondary source methods:\n\nWhat third-party research companies have researched your market? \nCould you access customer reviews? \nCan you look at other companies' marketing efforts?\n\nLet’s return to our example shoe company. If we want to understand more about what shoes runners like best and why, we could pick three methods:\n\nReview studies conducted by third-party market researchers about product quality (manufacturing, features, life span, etc.) \nInterview runners about their experiences with various shoes \nHold focus groups to understand how people think, feel, and talk about their favorite brands\n\nBefore beginning the hands-on research, get a bird’s-eye view of the market. This will help you pinpoint industry leaders. And see what their strategies and growth prospects look like. \n\nSemrush’s .Trends tools can help you do this. \n\nOpen the Market Explorer tool and choose one of three options:\n\nCreate List: Create a custom market with competitors of your choice\nFind Competitors: Have the tool compile and analyze a list of competitors\nAnalyze Category: Examine an entire industry\n\nLet's say you want to create your own custom list. \n\nFirst, select the location and enter the competitors. In our example, we'll enter six domains of popular running shoe brands:\n\nnike.com\nadidas.com\nsaucony.com\nhoka.com\nasics.com\nbrooks.com\n\nThen, name the list. We’ll name our list “Running shoe brands.” \n\nHit “Create and analyze.”\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice in the “Overview” report is the “Market Summary” widget.\n\nThis widget provides an overview of the market including the level of consolidation, the key players and their market share percentage, the market size, and more.\n\nIn our case, we see that the market has a moderately high consolidation level. This means most of the market share is owned (or “consolidated”) by one large player, with a few smaller players owning the remaining share.\n\nWe see nike.com is the market leader, owning 66.2% of the market. Followed by adidas.com (20.77%) and hoka.com (7.06%).\n\nFinally, the Market Size is large with a Total Addressable Market of 807.6M. This means there are approximately 807 million individuals who need your product or service (though not all of them may be willing, ready, or able to make a purchase).\n\nScroll down to discover the “Growth Quadrant.” This helps you understand how competitors are growing over time in relation to one another.\n\nThe Growth Quadrant contains four sections:\n\nGame Changers: Emerging websites with a high growth potential\nLeaders: Big, well-known companies whose website traffic is growing\nNiche Players: Companies with smaller presence\nEstablished Players: Stable, popular websites \n\nNike holds the lead in terms of traffic. And Adidas saw a large gain in traffic growth percentage. \n\nThis growth pushed them closer to the “Leaders” quadrant from the “Established Players” category.\n\nLooking at some of the minor players, Saucony moved to the “Game Changers” quadrant. In this case, we’d definitely want to look into what they’re doing to drive traffic and ask our research subjects questions about this brand.\n\nOverall, these broad insights help us determine what research methods we want to use and what questions we’d like to ask our target audience.\n\nOnce you’ve decided which direction to go in, come up with a timeline, delegate responsibilities, and execute your research. \n\nStep 3: Collect Data \n\nHow you collect data will depend on the type of research method you choose.\n\nFor qualitative research, like focus groups or interviews, write out answers and compare notes later. With surveys, you might produce reports.\n\nTools like Google Forms and Survey Monkey offer reports that organize your data and even include illustrations where applicable. \n\nFor quantitative research, collect raw data using a simple spreadsheet or more advanced data storage software. Tools like Google Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) and Tableau allow you to organize and depict data as graphs or charts. \n\nFor our footwear company example, we might collect qualitative data through our focus groups and interviews. For quantitative data, we could use the Semrush .Trends tools. \n\nFor example, Traffic Analytics provides traffic numbers for competitors’ websites. \n\nFirst, select your target location and enter up to five competitors' domains.\n\nThen, hit “Analyze.”\n\nYou'll get useful insights into your competitors’ traffic—including the trends, traffic sources, geo-distribution, etc. \n\nHere’s a look at saucony.com’s “Top Pages” report:\n\nIt allows us to see which pages have shown significant growth in traffic in the last 12 months.\n\nIn our example, it is the /endorphin-2-collection/ page:\n\nIn this example, we've discovered a page with an upcoming product launch—Endorphin Pro+ shoes. \n\nIn our focus groups, we could study customer responses to this launch or compare the traffic numbers or sources with new releases coming from competitors.\n\nStep 4: Analyze Data and Generate Insights\n\nAnalyzing data helps you discover answers to your initial research question(s) and turn those answers into strategies. This process begins by organizing the data. \n\nWith quantitative data, add everything up and enter it into a central location. Like a spreadsheet. \n\nOrganize ratings, rankings, “yes and no” answers, selections of multiple choice questions, and any other data. Once it’s organized, crunch the numbers to look for averages, ranges, or other important statistics. \n\nFor qualitative data, review all of the collected data and sort it into categories.For example: \n\nConcerns\nQuestions\nFrustrations\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nRecommendations \n\nOrganizing this data will help clarify themes. \n\nOnce you organize your data, review your initial research goals. \n\nHere are some guiding questions:\n\nDoes the data illuminate any trends? \nCan I think of any explanations for these trends? \nWhat’s surprising or interesting about the data? \nDoes the collected data help answer my original questions? \nDoes it lead to any other interesting questions? \n\nAs you notice trends or themes, present them visually. Tools like Miro and Mural can help you brainstorm, discover connections, and invite different people to the table to help interpret the data. \n\nTo continue with our footwear company example, let’s pretend we discovered these five insights based on the data:\n\nCustomers like durable running shoes; their favorite shoes last a long time \nCustomers are willing to pay more for quality running shoes \nCustomers are less likely to be loyal to one brand; quality matters over brand \nCustomers respond best to ads that depict professional runners \nCustomers like flashy designs and colors on their running shoes\n\nHighlight data that supports your argument or solves the problems you’re researching.\n\nDon’t worry if you discover negative results or trends. This gives you a chance to change direction and drop projects or strategies that aren't working. Which can save you time and money.\n\nStep 5: Present Your Findings and Continue Testing \n\nNow that you’ve done the heavy lifting, it’s time to put your findings to good use. \n\nTypically, this involves presenting your research to stakeholders and discussing improvements to your business or marketing plan.\n\nWhen presenting data, it helps to show:\n\nHow the research produced the data \nHow the data led to your insights\nHow your insights led to actionable suggestions\n\nLet’s return to our running shoe company. If we wanted to present information about pricing to our stakeholders, we might structure it like this:\n\nWe looked at which shoes avid runners prefer and why. The top shoes tend to be more expensive than less popular shoes. We asked about this in focus groups and interviews. \nParticipants told us they’re willing to invest more money into a good pair of shoes. High quality matters more than lower prices. Along with this, runners who pay more expect greater durability. \nBased on this data, our business might benefit from using quality materials and manufacturing processes instead of cutting costs with cheap materials and labor. We could improve our marketing strategy by highlighting the high-quality materials and care we put into manufacturing each pair. \n\nOnce you've made adjustments to your business or marketing plan based on the data, continue your research to see if your strategies are successful. \n\nA great way to follow up on the moves you’ve made based on your in-depth market research studies is agile market research. \n\nThe “agile” part means gathering data quickly and being able to iterate the process at any time.\n\nWhile it won’t replace in-depth market research, agile market research allows you to test hypotheses, receive feedback, and make swift changes. \n\nLet’s say we conducted a large-scale study on running shoes and launched our new product. Here’s an example of what the agile market research process might look like after that: \n\nAsk questions: Are the new shoes we developed comfortable? \nReview customer feedback for trends: E.g., many customers said the shoes were too tight on their toes.\nGenerate insights: The design of the toe in our shoes needs improvement \nMake improvements: Adjust the shape of the shoes in the toe and release new model \nAsk questions: How do your toes feel in our new shoes? \n\nComplete the agile market research process over and over again for continuous improvement. \n\nBefore You Start Your Research\n\nThough market research is a big undertaking, it’s necessary for survival in a competitive marketplace. \n\nA good place to start is the Semrush .Trends toolkit. The tools it contains provide you with quantitative data that will give you instant insights into your specific market and competitors.\n\nThis way, you can make informed decisions about your further data collection methods (e.g., focus groups, surveys, etc.).\n\nYou may also try the so-called SWOT analysis—a technique that helps you assess your business's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Read our guide to SWOT analysis that also includes a free template.\n\nKeep an eye out, stay curious, and good luck out there! \n\nGet Instant Insights Into Your Market\n\nwith Semrush .Trends tools\n\nTry It Now →",
