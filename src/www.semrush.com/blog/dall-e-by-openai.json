  "content": "What Is DALL·E 2?\n\nDALL-E 2 is a type of generative artificial intelligence (AI) that produces images from text. These generated images can look like drawings, paintings, and photos created by humans.\n\nTo use DALL-E 2, a user types in a sentence (a text prompt) describing a visual scene. Then the software creates a relevant graphic instantly.\n\nFor example, the tool generated four images for the prompt “3D render a diver meeting a sea turtle in the ocean.”\n\nFun fact: The name of DALL-E is a mix of Pixar’s WALL-E movie and artist Salvador Dali.\n\nWhen its creators updated the way the software generates images, they changed its name to DALL-E 2.\n\nHow Does DALL-E 2 Work?\n\nDALL-E 2’s trainers “showed” the software millions of images (all with associated meanings) from all over the web.\n\nThe art generator refers to this dataset when given a prompt and then uses statistical patterns to create its own.\n\nDALL-E 2 relies on a computer program called a diffusion model. \n\nA diffusion model analyzes images to learn the underlying patterns and features of each part:\n\nThen it can use these pieces to recreate its own original, AI-generated images.\n\nFor example, DALL-E has analyzed thousands of images of cats and birds. Which is why it recognizes that cats have pointy ears and whiskers while birds have beaks and wings.\n\nSo if a user asks for AI art that includes a cat, DALL-E can replicate what it thinks a cat looks like.\n\nFor example, here are the results for the prompt, “A realistic photo of a cat with a bird’s wings.”\n\nNow that you know the basics, let’s generate some images.\n\nHow to Use OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 to Generate Compelling Digital Art\n\nTo use DALL-E 2’s image creator, set up an account on OpenAI and generate your first graphic.\n\nWant to align them better with your expectations? \n\nWork on your prompts, edit your graphics, and discover what DALL-E struggles with.\n\nSet Up an Account on OpenAI\n\nTo sign up for an account, go to chat.openai.com and click “Sign up.”\n\nThen, follow the prompts to create and verify your account.\n\nWith the original DALL-E, new users got 50 free credits when they set up a new account. Plus an extra 15 to use every month.\n\nUnfortunately, those perks only apply to users who signed up for the AI system before April 6, 2023. \n\nNow, you have to buy 115 credits for $15 to try it out.\n\nTake Note of DALL-E 2’s Image Generation Guidelines\n\nBefore you use your account, take note of DALL-E 2’s content policy.\n\nHere are a few examples of images you can’t create, upload, or share:\n\nOpenAI also encourages users to share that AI was involved in your work. You can remove the DALL-E signature, but you can’t say it was entirely human-generated.\n\nYou are also not allowed to:\n\nUpload images of anyone without their consent\nUpload images you do not own the rights to\nCreate images of celebrities and public figures\n\nBreaking these rules can get you banned. \n\nFind Out What Content You Need for Your Marketing\n\nLook at your website, blog posts, and social media platforms. Then decide which kind of images will help to promote different aspects.\n\nLet’s say you run an online candy store.\n\nYou may have landing pages that categorize different types of candy you sell. For example, chocolate, fudge, gummies, and vegan candy.\n\nYou already have your product shots for these. But they don’t stand out from any other candy shop.\n\nInstead, you want more arty, whimsical images. \n\nFor example, a cartoon drawing of a lollipop in space:\n\nDALL-E 2 can create these kinds of images in a few seconds.\n\nTo decide what you need, break down your marketing channels.\n\nYou may already have:\n\nA website with landing pages for each category of candy\nAn Instagram and Facebook account where you ask for feedback on new products\nA blog where you write about the “top 10 types” of each candy\nAn email marketing newsletter where you promote monthly deals\nA scheduled social media post to promote your event or products\n\nNote your channels and which upcoming pages you need images for. Including older posts you want to refresh with new content.\n\nPro tip: If you need to create social media content (images or videos with a caption), then check out Semrush’s AI Social Content Generator.\n\nSimply provide the following information:\n\nThe post topic\nThe language the post should be in\nYour brand logo, colors, and preferred font\n\nAnd the tool will generate entire social media posts for you. Including the caption, image, carousel, or video.\n\nOnce you have your list of channels, move on to the next step.\n\nGenerate Your First Generated Image (+ Prompts)\n\nHead to DALL-E 2’s landing page. Then type a detailed description (a prompt) into the text box and click “Generate.” \n\nThere will be a short loading time. \n\nThen the software will generate several variations of AI images that it thinks match your prompt.\n\nLet’s try to create an image to promote your candy store’s new “Day at the Fairground” treats on social media.\n\nNote: DALL-E 2 is faster than the original version and offers variations of higher-resolution images.\n\nHere are four generated images for the prompt, “A blue elephant made of candy floss flying above a fairground.” \n\nNot exactly how you pictured? Add a few more details to the prompt box and click “Generate.”\n\nDALL-E 2 suggests adding a style to improve the quality of results.\n\nLet’s add “a painting of” before the original prompt:\n\nThe fairground is now more accurate. But the candy floss texture of the elephant is gone.\n\nKeep tweaking your prompt until you get the results you want. After all, more detail usually means more accurate graphics.\n\nFor example, DALL-E 2 suggests that you can get more specific by adding an artistic style or your favorite artist.\n\nHere are a few variations of “An oil painting of a single coconut tree on an island surrounded by water:”\n\nBut more detail isn’t always better.\n\nThese images started with the prompt “A happy mushroom skipping through a meadow:”\n\nBut in this case, adding “with legs and a face” lowered the quality.\n\nHere were two variations for “A tiger climbing a tree in the jungle with a monkey sitting on a branch eating an apple, pixel art:”\n\nDALL-E 2 got the style and the subjects right. But the tiger isn’t climbing the tree and the monkey isn’t eating an apple.\n\nHere are some of the ways you can improve your prompts for more accurate graphics:\n\nBe more specific and detailed\nDon’t add too many subjects doing different things\nTry various styles and artists (other than realism)\nJoin OpenAI’s Discord to ask the community for tips\nRead this free ebook of prompts\n\nYou can also try Semrush’s free Sentence Rewriter Tool.\n\nSimply type in your sentence and click “Paraphrase.” And the tool will come up with three versions of your sentence.\n\nWhen you’re happy with the rephrased version, click “Copy” and paste the text into your content.\n\nDownload Your First Generated Image\n\nLet’s go back to our fairground prompt.\n\nOnce you’re happy with one of the generated images, click on it to view a larger size.\n\nNote: The image will shrink slightly when you hover over it, so you know which image you’re selecting.\n\nYou can then click the top right icon on the image to download it. \n\nYou can also “Share” it to a public page. Or “Save” it to a customized collection:\n\nRecent variations are available in a toolbar on the right side of the DALL-E 2 dashboard.\n\nEdit Your Graphics In-App or with a Third-Party Tool\n\nYou can use DALL-E 2’s inpainting and outpainting features to tweak your images in the app. Or download them and use a third-party tool like Adobe Photoshop for editing.\n\nHere’s what “outpainting” with DALL-E 2 looks like for the prompt “Landscape:”\n\nAnd here’s how it compares to Photoshop’s Generative Fill feature:\n\nDALL-E offers two main types of in-app editing:\n\nInpainting allows you to change visual elements within a graphic \nOutpainting expands an original image past its borders with visual elements of the same style\n\nHere are two examples of inpainting where the user asked DALL-E 2 to “add a flamingo” and specified where:\n\nYou can use this feature (and outpainting) to make your composition more interesting.\n\nTry outpainting on one of the earlier images.\n\nChoose an area outside the image (in this case, it overlapped) and add a new prompt:\n\nYou still get four variations to choose from. So scroll through and click “Accept” when you’re satisfied:\n\nIf you click “Cancel,” DALL-E 2 won’t add the additional part.\n\nYou can use these features for images you generate within the tool. Or you can upload your own and edit it in-app.\n\nBe aware that each generation will use a credit. Even if you don’t pick any of the variations.\n\nBecause of that, a third-party tool like Photoshop might be a better option. Since it gives you more options and could be more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nBut money isn’t the only issue. DALL-E 2 also has some creative limits.\n\nUse Your Graphics in Your Content\n\nWhen you’re happy with all of your DALL-E images, use them in your content. For example, share them as social media posts, videos, or blogs.\n\nKetchup giant Heinz based an entire marketing campaign around DALL-E 2 images in 2022.\n\nThe brand noticed that any ketchup-related prompt looked like a bottle of Heinz:\n\nSo it created a clever YouTube video and used a variety of DALL-E 2 images to “prove” that even AI prefers Heinz.\n\nThe brand shared the images on social media, its website, billboards, and paper ads.\n\nTheir creative use of DALL-E 2 even won the marketing agency several awards. \n\nYou can use your images in a similar way.\n\nFor example, Semrush’s AI Social Content Generator can help you generate the copy and design parts of your social posts.\n\nInstead of using stock images, you can start with one of your DALL-E 2 creations. Or have the tool suggest a post idea and go back to DALL-E to create a relevant image.\n\nYou can also create banners with AdCreative.ai.\n\nThe tool allows you to generate banners using AI and stock imagery that are pre-set to fit on social media and ad platforms. But you can get more creative with your DALL-E images instead.\n\nOnce you fill your blogs with eye-catching AI imagery, try AI Video Marketing Automator to turn your posts into videos.\n\nSimply upload the URL and the tool will create your video. \n\nIf you want to add any extra images, you can do so before sharing.\n\nWhatever the format, DALL-E 2 images add a unique twist to any marketing materials.\n\nBonus: Be Aware of DALL-E 2’s Limitations\n\nDALL-E can produce some amazing graphics. But it’s not perfect. \n\nIt struggles with composition, spelling, and objects it doesn’t recognize.\n\nAt the time of writing, here are some of the main elements that DALL-E 2 has trouble with:\n\nScenes with two or more characters\nObjects it doesn’t “recognize” (e.g., a specific type of skateboard)\nDistinguishing between foregrounds and backgrounds\nSpelling out words within graphics\nHyper-realistic scenes (e.g., human hands usually have more or fewer fingers than they should)\n\nLet’s look at a few examples.\n\nHere’s what “A female gangster in a fedora hat talking to a cat wearing sunglasses around a poker table” produced:\n\nThe prompt specifies that the cat should be the one wearing sunglasses. But DALL-E 2 misunderstood.\n\nSo try being more specific: “A female gangster wears a fedora, a cat wears sunglasses, they talk around a poker table.”\n\nBut that doesn’t work either.\n\nInstead it created three characters. But no cat wearing sunglasses.\n\nAnother element DALL-E 2 can’t produce are words within a graphic.\n\nFor whatever reason, anything you ask for will be a jumbled mess of characters.\n\nThe software also tends to ignore elements it doesn’t “recognize.” \n\nFor example, it created a pretty accurate “drawing of a blonde woman riding a longboard.”\n\nBut the longboard looks different in each image.\n\nLuckily, the tech is always learning despite these limitations. And something DALL-E 2 struggles with today may not be an issue tomorrow. \n\nYou may also find a way to phrase your prompt to achieve more accurate results.\n\nThe only solution is to keep experimenting.\n\nUse DALL-E 2 to Enhance Your Content Creation Efforts\n\nOpenAI’s photo generator DALLE-2 is powering a new creative renaissance for marketers. \n\nAs a result, those with little artistic ability can now create original graphics from a line of text.\n\nOnce you have your images, head to Semrush’s AI Social Content Generator to get help with your captions and hashtags. Or start with a banner using AdCreative.ai.\n\nWant to turn your new image-packed blogs into videos? Try AI Video Marketing Automator.",
