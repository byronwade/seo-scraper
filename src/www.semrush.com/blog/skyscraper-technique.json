  "content": "What Is the Skyscraper Technique?\n\nThe skyscraper technique is an SEO link building tactic that involves finding competitive content other sites link to, creating something better, then encouraging sites to link to you instead.\n\nWebsite owners want to link to the best possible resources.\n\nBy improving on popular content in your niche, you can “steal” its backlinks (links from other sites). And earn more links in the future.\n\nThe skyscraper method was invented by Brian Dean of Backlinko. He said the tallest skyscraper in the world is the one that gets attention—just like the best resource is the one that earns links.\n\nWhat Is Skyscraper Content?\n\nSkyscraper content is content created as part of the skyscraper technique. It’s designed to be a better version of a widely linked resource.\n\nFor example, it might be:\n\nMore comprehensive\nMore up to date\nCreated by a more credible expert\nPublished on a more authoritative website\nPresented more effectively\n\nOr perhaps it contains unique insights, tools, and visuals that add value for the user.\n\nSkyscraper content is crucial to the success of the skyscraper method. Without it, web admins have no strong incentive to link to your site.\n\nYou’ll learn more about creating skyscraper content later.\n\nWhy Use the Skyscraper Technique for SEO?\n\nThe skyscraper technique helps you earn backlinks that can drive referral traffic and benefit your SEO.\n\nGoogle treats certain kinds of backlinks like votes of confidence. In general, the higher the quality and quantity of backlinks you have, the more authoritative Google perceives your site (and page) to be.\n\nUnlike other link building tactics, the skyscraper method:\n\nAllows you to inherit links that previously pointed to competitors\nHelps you earn backlinks on pages with established traffic and authority\nEncourages you to create quality content, which can benefit you in other ways\nIs easily scalable\nHow to Do Skyscraper Link Building\n\nLearn how to do skyscraper link building step by step:\n\nFind Competitive Content\nCreate Skyscraper Content\nConduct Email Outreach\n\nTip: If you haven’t already, create your free Semrush account to follow along with this tutorial.\n\n1. Find Competitive Content\n\nFirst, find the competitive content you’ll improve (and work to inherit links from).\n\nThe following content types tend to work best for the skyscraper technique:\n\nHow-to guides\nComparison guide\nComplete guides\nBuying guides\nListicles \nReview posts\nQuestion posts\nCheat sheets\nTemplates\nInfographics\n\nWhy? They’re more likely to:\n\nCover topics that are relevant to your brand and target audience\nProvide opportunities for you to improve\nHave lots of backlinks you want to inherit (and that are possible to inherit)\nAnalyze Competitors’ Content\n\nWith Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool, you can quickly find your competitors’ most linked pages.\n\nEnter a competitor’s domain. Or enter a subfolder that contains their informational content (e.g., “https://www.carmax.com/articles/”).\n\nThen, click “Analyze.”\n\nGo to the “Indexed Pages” tab to see the number of backlinks by URL.\n\nThe list is sorted by the number of linking “Domains,” from highest to lowest. \n\n(Generally, it’s better to get links from multiple domains. Rather than multiple links from the same domain.)\n\nStarting at the top, look for pages that might work with the skyscraper method.\n\nThe URL should provide a good indication of the page’s content. For example, “/articles/sedan-vs-coupe” is likely a comparison guide. And the topic’s still relevant.\n\nUse the “external link” icon to view the page.\n\nTo analyze it in more detail.\n\nFind Your Rivals’ Most Linked Pages\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nReview Backlink Opportunities \n\nNext, review the content’s backlinks to determine whether inheriting them is possible—and worthwhile.\n\nReturn to Backlink Analytics and click the number under “Backlinks.”\n\nTo maximize the skyscraper technique’s SEO benefits, you need to inherit backlinks with the follow attribute. (As opposed to the nofollow attribute, which tells Google to largely ignore the link.)\n\nClick “Follow” to apply a filter.\n\nAlso pay attention to the “Page AS” column. This contains the source page’s Authority Score (AS). Generally, the higher the AS, the more valuable the backlink. \n\n(Learn more about what makes a good backlink in our link building guide.)\n\nConsider opening each source page to look at the backlink in context. To judge how likely the web admin is to update the link. \n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\nAre they keeping this page up to date?\nCould your link fulfill the same function, but better?\nDo they have a relationship with the linked site?\nWould linking to your site present a conflict of interest?\nDo they have editorial control over the link?\nWould updating the link take a lot of work?\n\nIf the competitive content seems like a good candidate for the skyscraper method, add it to a shortlist (along with any helpful notes).\n\nOr move onto the next step.\n\nTip: Perform this step with multiple competitors to find the best skyscraper link building opportunities. You can find your biggest SEO rivals with Semrush’s Organic Research Competitors Report.\n\n2. Create Skyscraper Content\n\nNext, create skyscraper content.\n\nThis is not only a better version of the competitor content you’ve found. But the best content of its kind on the web (by some margin).\n\nAfter all, the sites linking to this kind of resource need a compelling reason to link to your version instead. \n\nOutdo the Competition\n\nThe best approach to creating skyscraper content depends on the nature of the topic. And the quality of existing content.\n\nBut there are a few common ways to outdo the competition:\n\nBe more comprehensive. Add content where it adds value. Try adding new list items, answering more questions, or going deeper into the topic. The most backlinked articles contain 1,201-2,000 words, according to Semrush research. \nAdd unique insights. Give users information and ideas they can’t find anywhere else. Try conducting original research or engaging in thought leadership. \nImprove user experience. Stand out from competitors by making your content faster, easier to digest, and more attractive. \nEstablish credibility. Display author and company credentials on the page to prove that your content is trustworthy. And that you’re an authority on the topic.\nCreate images and videos. Posts containing images and videos are more likely to get links, according to Semrush research.\n\nLet’s say you’re trying to inherit backlinks to CarMax’s sedan vs. coupe guide.\n\nAfter reviewing this page, you’d search Google to find other quality resources on this topic. And review those as well.\n\nYou might find that none of these resources visualize the differences between a coupe and a sedan.\n\nSo, adding an infographic to your guide could give you a competitive edge. And help you secure more backlinks.\n\nTip: Check out our guide for more advice on creating quality content. \n\nOptimize Content for Search\n\nTo help ensure that your skyscraper content ranks well in search—with or without backlinks—optimize for relevant keywords. Using on-page SEO techniques.\n\nYou can see what keywords your competitors rank for with Semrush’s Organic Research tool. And use the findings to inform your strategy.\n\nEnter the URL, choose your country, and click “Search.”\n\nThen, go to the “Positions” tab. To identify relevant keywords you want to rank for.\n\nKeywords ranking in the highest positions tend to be most relevant. But there are many factors to consider when choosing keywords for SEO.\n\nWhen you’ve selected target keywords, enter them into Semrush’s SEO Content Template. \n\nThen, choose your country and click “Create content template.”\n\nThe tool provides SEO recommendations based on the top 10 results for your target keyword(s). \n\nThis includes semantically related keywords, backlinks, readability, and text length.\n\nWhen you’re ready to put the suggestions into action, head over to “Real-time Content Check.”\n\nAnd click “Open in SEO Writing Assistant.”\n\nThe SEO Writing Assistant will score your content’s SEO, originality, readability, and tone of voice in real time. Helping ensure the page is rankable, linkable, and engaging.\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →\n3. Conduct Email Outreach\n\nEmail outreach is the process of contacting web admins who might be interested in linking to your content (i.e., link building prospects). And explaining why they should link to your content.\n\nIn this case, you’re promoting your skyscraper content.\n\nFind Link Building Prospects\n\nThe skyscraper technique is primarily about inheriting links from sites that already link to a similar page.\n\nRemember—you can find these sites through Backlink Analytics. \n\nJust enter the URL of any competing resource. \n\nClick “Analyze.” \n\nThen, go to the “Backlinks” tab.\n\nAnd scroll down to the table.\n\nUse the “Export” button to save your results in an Excel or CSV file.\n\nNot every backlink opportunity is worth pursuing. Consider how likely the site is to change their link. And how valuable the backlink will be.\n\nIt’s also important to educate yourself about potentially toxic backlinks.\n\nIdentify Contacts\n\nWhen you find a backlink you want to inherit, open the source page. To see whether the content is attributed to a staff writer.\n\nLike this:\n\nStaff writers often have the motive and power to update links. So they make good contacts for skyscraper link building.\n\nIf there’s no staff writer, try contacting someone else on the site’s editorial team. Generic email addresses like editorial@website.com should be a last resort.\n\nThere are various ways to find email addresses. \n\nFindThatLead is one of the most reliable. And you can try it for free.\n\nJust search a website to find contacts who work there:\n\nYou can email your contacts one by one. Or build a prospect list and send pitches in bulk.\n\nWrite and Send Pitches\n\nNext, write your skyscraper email pitch. The goal is convincing the content owner to update their link so it points to your resource instead.\n\nExplain what’s in it for them—i.e., how your link will enhance their content.\n\nA friendly, personalized approach helps grab the recipient’s attention. And make them more receptive to your proposal.\n\nHere’s a skyscraper email example to inspire you:\n\nSubject: Idea for Your Sedan Buying Guide\n\nHi John,\n\nI found your sedan buying guide and noticed that you referenced CarMax’s sedan vs coupe article.\n\nWe’ve just published an in-depth sedan vs coupe guide over at Example Site that could add even more value to your content.\n\nIt contains some more up-to-date figures. And an infographic I think your readers will love:\n\n[Infographic here]\n\nIf you like it, maybe you'd consider linking to it within your article?\n\nAll the best,\n\nRachel\n\nYou can send emails and track your results manually. \n\nBut Semrush’s Link Building Tool simplifies the entire process. And makes it easier to scale the SEO skyscraper technique.\n\nAfter setting up your project and connecting your mailbox, you can:\n\nImport your link building prospects (The tool will give each site a rating to help you prioritize.)\nCreate outreach emails and templates using placeholders\nSend emails to your chosen addresses (The tool also collects contact information automatically.)\nCheck whether emails have been sent, opened, or replied to at a glance\nMonitor the backlinks you earn to ensure they remain active\n\nThe tool also finds new link prospects based on your competitors and target keywords. So you can build more links that boost your SEO.\n\nTip: Skyscraper content can help you earn links on other relevant, reputable websites. Don’t stop at inheriting backlinks from competing pages—reach out to other sites that might want to link.\n\nBuild Backlinks Easily\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
