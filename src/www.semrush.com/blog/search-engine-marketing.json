  "content": "What Is Search Engine Marketing?\n\nSearch engine marketing (SEM) is a digital marketing practice aimed at improving a website’s visibility in search engines through paid ads and unpaid results. \n\nWith paid search marketing, your website appears in paid results. These results typically appear as “Sponsored.” \n\nLike this:\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO)—improvements to your website that improve its visibility—can help you gain unpaid results (also called organic results). \n\nAnd these results appear without any label: \n\nUsing both approaches in search engine marketing can help you:\n\nImprove website visibility\nAttract more traffic \nGenerate more leads\nIncrease revenue\nGrow your business\nHow Does Search Engine Marketing Work?\n\nSEM relies on keywords (phrases users enter into search engines) that can be used to create relevant content and ads designed to attract your target audience. \n\nUsing the right keywords in the right places is a key part of getting your ads and content to appear prominently in search results.\n\nYour odds of success in both realms is greater if you ensure that your ads/content match the keyword’s search intent—the reason why people search that query.\n\nWe’ll go over this in more detail later. But for now, know you can easily spot the type of search intent when using the Keyword Magic Tool for keyword research (in the “Intent” column): \n\nPerform Keyword Research for SEM Campaigns\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nTypes of Search Engine Marketing\nSearch Engine Optimization \n\nSearch engine optimization is focused on improving your search engine visibility using non-paid tactics like publishing quality content that contains your target keywords. \n\nBut also using other on-page optimizations (e.g., writing enticing meta descriptions), applying technical fixes (e.g., implementing a sound website architecture), and leveraging off-page tactics (e.g., gaining links from other reputable websites).\n\nOrganic search marketing takes time to deliver results. But traffic and visibility generated by organic search marketing efforts can last months or even years. \n\nPlus, refreshing your content to include updated information can increase your chances of maintaining or improving your search engine results page (SERP) rankings.\n\nFor example, finance site The Balance published a post on blogging back in 2008 that continues to appear in the top results for “blogging.” Because they keep it updated.\n\nPaid Search Marketing\n\nPaid search marketing is focused on improving your search engine visibility through paid advertisements. Which involves writing relevant copy, including compelling images (for some ads), choosing audience targeting, and specifying keywords to trigger the ads. \n\nPaid ads work on a pay-per-click (PPC) basis. In this business model, the advertiser pays each time someone clicks their ad.\n\nPaid search often delivers faster results than organic search marketing. But the moment you stop your paid ad campaigns, the visibility and traffic they generate ceases.\n\nHere are the different types of Google ads for SEM:\n\nSearch Ads\n\nGoogle search ads appear on SERPs when users search for specific keywords. \n\nLike this example for the keyword “buy firm mattress online.”\n\nShopping Ads\n\nGoogle Shopping Ads appear when someone searches for a specific product. \n\nThey can appear in SERPs, Google’s Shopping tab, Google Images, Maps, etc.\n\nLike this example for “buy waterproof house mat.”\n\nLocal Ads\n\nLocal ads help you promote your local business on Google SERPs and Maps. \n\nLike this example for “graphic design agency near me.”\n\nPaid SEM Best Practices\n\nMany marketers include SEO in their SEM strategies. But we focused the tips below on paid search marketing with Google Search ads.\n\nLearn How Google Ads Works\n\nGoogle Ads uses an auction system to determine which ads to display and in what order. \n\nAccording to Google’s explanation of the auction, there are six main factors they consider:\n\nMaximum bid: The maximum amount you're willing to pay for an ad click \nAd quality: How relevant and helpful your ad is likely to be for users\nImpact of ad assets (formerly called extensions) and format: How the additional information you provided in your ad (like phone number, links to specific pages, etc.) and format are expected to affect performance\nAd Rank thresholds: A set of values used for determining whether your ads are eligible to be displayed \nAd context: The way factors like the search term used, the user’s location, the time of search, the device used, and more play a role\nAuction competitiveness: The level of competition impacts who wins and what their final cost per click (CPC) will be\nSet Up Your Campaign Structure\n\nA well-structured Google Ads account groups ads together topically to ensure strategic bids. \n\nLet’s go over the way an account breaks down:\n\nCampaign: The highest level of organization within a Google Ads account. Each campaign can comprise multiple ad groups. Campaigns allow you to set an overall budget, choose your audience targeting, and apply settings that affect all ad groups within the campaign.\nAd group: Within each campaign, ad groups organize your ads by a common theme. Each ad group contains one or more ads. And a set of keywords.\nKeyword: Terms you bid on for each ad set\nAd: Individual ads’ copy that users will see when your ads are triggered\n\nHere’s a visual to clarify: \n\nChoose the Right Keywords\n\nOnce you’ve determined your ad groups, you’ll want to target specific keyword groups that resonate with your audience for each. \n\nAnd selecting the right ones is all about striking a balance between including as many relevant terms as possible while omitting those that aren’t likely to drive results. Bidding on irrelevant keywords can waste your budget. \n\nHere’s how to select the right ones:\n\nTarget Keywords with Commercial and Transactional Intent\n\nChoose keywords people use when they’re clearly interested in making a purchase. Which you can determine by analyzing keyword intent.\n\nThere are four types of intent:\n\nNavigational: Keywords people type into search engines when they want to find a specific site or page\nInformational: Keywords people use to find information\nCommercial: Keywords people use to research specific products, services, or brands \nTransactional: Keywords people use when they want to perform a transaction\n\nFor ads intended to drive sales, focus on commercial and transactional keywords.\n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool to find these keywords. \n\nJust enter a broad term related to your product or service. Then, select the “Intent” drop-down, check the boxes next to “Commercial” and “Transactional,” and click “Apply.”\n\nYou’ll now be left with just keywords that have commercial and/or transactional intent to consider.\n\nNow, let’s go over how to evaluate those options.\n\nReview Keyword Volume and Competition\n\nWhen evaluating terms in the Keyword Magic Tool, take a look at how many average monthly searches they get (volume) as well as how competitive they are.\n\nIn the Keyword Magic Tool, select the “Volume” drop-down. And choose a range from the menu. \n\nThe range will depend on your industry and how popular the product or service is. Because we’re using the highly competitive shoe niche in our example, we’re setting the range from 1,001 to 10,000. \n\nNext, click the gear icon on the top right side of the table and click the box next to \"Competitive Density” to add it to the table. This is a metric that measures competition in Google Ads on a scale of 0 (not competitive) to 1 (highly competitive).\n\nReview the keyword list and select ones that strike a balance between volume and competition.\n\nKeywords with high search volumes tend to be competitive but can help you gain considerable visibility. Lower-volume search terms are often less competitive but often attract users who are highly motivated to buy.\n\nThen, consider the “CPC” column for each term you’re interested in. \n\nThis is the average price advertisers pay for a click on their ads targeting that term. Which can inform how much you want to bid to stand a good chance of winning the auction without going too high. \n\nRepeat this process for all your ad groups. \n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Ads\n\nReviewing your competitors’ ad copy can give you ideas to use when writing your own ad copy.\n\nSemrush’s Advertising Research tool can help you do this.\n\nEnter a competitor’s domain name, select a country, and click“Search.”\n\nHead to the “Ad Copies” section to analyze your competitor’s ads.\n\nIf you click on the drop-down icon below each ad copy box, you’ll get a list of keywords the ad is ranking for in paid search:\n\nUse these ads as inspiration for your campaigns. \n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nWrite Compelling Ad Copy\n\nEach paid search ad is made up of four components: \n\nHeadline\nDisplay URL\nDescription\nAd assets (optional)\n\nHere are a few best practices for each of these components:\n\nOptimize Your Headline\n\nThe headline is likely the first thing your target audience will see. So, it needs to be compelling.\n\nThat means you should be clear and specific about your product or service while meeting the 30-character limit (note that you can use up to 15 headlines).\n\nAnd a good headline should:\n\nInclude simple, direct language\nUse keywords naturally\nAddress user intent\nAppeal to emotion or use humor (if it fits your brand)\n\nTip\n\nUse a tool like the AI Writing Assistant to create better ad headlines. Take a trial of the app and find the \"Google Ads Headlines\" tool.  \n\nChoose a Display URL\n\nYour display URL is the web address that appears on your ad. It gives users an idea of where they’ll land after clicking on the ad.\n\nThe base part of the display URL is your website's main address. Like “https://www.yourwebsite.com.” \n\nBut you can make it more specific to your ad to give users an idea of what type of page they’re heading to. Like “https://www.yourwebsite.com/shoes/athletic.” \n\nUse a display URL that will:\n\nHelp users anticipate what kind of page they’ll land on\nHighlight any specific offers to entice users\nBe short and simple\nWrite Click-Worthy Descriptions\n\nWriting enticing descriptions can persuade users to click—and you can add up to four descriptions per ad group, each up to 90 characters long.\n\nHere are a few tips for writing click-worthy ad descriptions:\n\nIncorporate keywords in a way that feels natural and relevant to users \nKeep messaging concise so users don’t lose interest\nInclude a call to action like “shop now,” “place your order,” or “book now”\n\nTip\n\nUse AI Ad Copy Generator to speed up this process. \n\nInclude Ad Extensions\n\nUsing ad assets to include additional information may convince users to click.\n\nA few examples of ad extensions are: \n\nCall buttons\nLocation information\nLinks to specific parts of your site\nAdditional text\n\nBut they won’t always show up. Because they’re influenced by a few factors:\n\nAd rank: Assets appear when a minimum ad rank is met\nPosition of your ad: Ads with a higher position take priority for displaying assets\nThe specific assets you’ve used: Assets will only show if they’re predicted to improve your ad’s performance\n\nRead Google’s full list of ad assets to learn more about specific types.\n\nTrack and Analyze SEM Metrics\n\nMeasure how well your paid ads are performing by evaluating the following metrics:\n\nImpressions\n\nImpressions tell you how many times your ad was shown to users. Which gives you an idea of your reach and visibility. \n\nYou can see this metric within Google Ads:\n\nClicks\n\nClicks are the number of times your ad was clicked. Which can help you understand interest.\n\nAnd you can see them in Google Ads:\n\nYou can also evaluate your click-through rate (CTR)—the percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks. \n\nThis helps you understand how effectively your ad captures your audience’s attention.\n\nConversion Rate\n\nConversion rate refers to the percentage of ad clicks that lead to conversions. Which helps you understand how effective your ad and landing page are. \n\nOnce you set up conversion tracking, you can view this metric in Google Ads.\n\nPaid SEM Challenges\nCreating a High-Quality Landing Page Experience\n\nCreating a quality landing page that aligns with your ads can impact whether your ads appear in the first place. And persuade visitors to take action.\n\nSo, use consistent messaging and ensure a positive user experience by leveraging intuitive navigation and prioritizing fast page loading speed.\n\nOur Landing Page Builder makes it easy to create user-friendly landing pages without any coding experience. \n\nChoose from 400+ customizable templates to get started. \n\nThen use the drag-and-drop builder to create professional landing pages that align with your campaign goals. \n\nUnderstanding the Geo-Targeting Settings\n\nThe default geo-targeting setting in Google Ads is “Presence or interest: People in, regularly in, or who've shown interest in your targeted locations.” \n\nBut this setting isn’t ideal if you’re advertising a local business. \n\nUpdating your geo-targeting settings to “Presence: People in or regularly in your targeted locations” lets you target only those who are physically within or frequently within your specified area.\n\nImprove Your Search Engine Visibility with SEM\n\nSEM enables you to attract more website traffic and generate more revenue.
