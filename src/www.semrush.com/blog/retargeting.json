  "content": "Not every user is ready to make a purchase when they first land on your website.\n\nThey might be running short on time. Or maybe they want to do some more research or consult with someone else first. \n\nThis is where retargeting comes in. It’s a powerful way to reach potential customers who didn’t convert during their first visit to your website. \n\nLet’s explore retargeting in more detail.\n\nWhat Is Retargeting?\n\nRetargeting is a marketing tactic that uses online ads to target users who’ve already visited or interacted with your website or social media presence. And provides an opportunity to convert users who didn’t become customers during that initial interaction.\n\nThis approach involves serving paid ads in various forms to past website visitors or social media users who interacted with your pages. \n\nRetargeting ads encourage visitors to go to the website and complete your desired actions like making a purchase, booking a demo, signing up for a free trial, etc.\n\nFor example, say a prospect used Google to search for “kids footwear,” and then looked at different shoe models on a footwear brand’s website without making a purchase.\n\nThe footwear brand can retarget them based on that activity so that when the prospect is swiping through Instagram stories, they stumble upon an ad by the same footwear store. With the exact same model they viewed on the store’s website.\n\nHere’s what that process looks like:\n\nRetargeting vs. Remarketing\n\nThe terms retargeting and remarketing are often used interchangeably. But their meanings differ slightly.\n\nRetargeting is used to reach previous site visitors through ads. And encourage them to return and complete your desired action.\n\nHere’s an example from clothing company The Normal Brand that’s shown to users who previously visited the brand’s website without making a purchase:\n\nBut remarketing typically refers to personalized, targeted messages sent to individuals who’ve already made a purchase. So, the primary goal of remarketing is to nurture relationships and encourage repeat purchases.\n\nRemarketing also tends to leverage email.\n\nFor example, Grammarly sends emails with special discounts to remind existing users that they can upgrade or renew their subscription:\n\nNote\n\nGoogle uses the term remarketing exclusively. But it’s important to keep in mind that these efforts are nearly always discussing retargeting.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Retargeting Campaigns?\n\nRetargeting is beneficial because it enables you to reach out to prospects who are already familiar with your brand.\n\nBut let’s break down the benefits of running retargeting campaigns more specifically.\n\nDriving Cost-Efficiency\n\nRetargeting ads typically generate far better returns than ads that don’t leverage retargeting. Because they allow you to reach customers who are already familiar with you rather than starting from scratch.\n\nConsider an Instagram ad like this that includes a discount:\n\nPeople who already browsed the website for these particular shoes are going to be more receptive to this sale. And more likely to make a purchase.\n\nImproving Brand Recall\n\nRetargeting can help with brand recall because it provides multiple touchpoints with your target audience.\n\nBy serving a relevant ad based on users’ actions, you can gently remind them of your business and offer. Because new prospects need a bit more prompting to convert, as they may not be fully ready to purchase the first time they interact with your brand.\n\nPromoting New or Popular Products\n\nRetargeting can be a highly effective way to promote new or popular products. Because it targets people who’ve already shown interest in your brand. \n\nSo, these visitors may be more likely to buy from you. And that can positively affect your campaign’s return on investment (ROI).\n\nReaching Prospects at Every Stage of the Buyer’s Journey\n\nRetargeting ads allow you to tailor your messages based on where the user is in their buyer’s journey. \n\nFor example, retargeting those who only viewed specific products vs. those who abandoned their cart. \n\nThis way, you can use more relevant and personalized ad creative that will prompt the user to make a purchase.\n\nHow Does Retargeting Work?\n\nRetargeting uses tracking pixels (which Google refers to as tags) to collect information about your website visitors and prospects who engage with you on social media. \n\nThis is a piece of code provided by the advertising platform (such as Google Ads) that you place in the website header so that it loads on every page.\n\nWhen a user visits your website, the tracking pixel is placed in their browser. This way, the advertising platform recognizes the user during visits to other websites or social media platforms where your ads can reach them.\n\nPixels don’t collect visitors’ personal data like names or addresses. But they record the user’s IP address, so your retargeting ads can be served to that IP address in the future.\n\nDepending on your reporting tools, the tracking pixel can tell if a user has completed a purchase or conversion. This can help with ongoing campaigns, selling add-ons, and advertising based on previous purchases.\n\nBeyond IP addresses, tracking pixels can monitor various user actions:\n\nPage views\nClicks\nForm submissions\nVideo views\nDownloads\nAdd-to-carts\nPurchases\n\nThis means you can tailor your ads to better resonate with the users’ previous interactions with your brand.\n\nTypes of Retargeting Campaigns\nGeneral Website Retargeting\n\nGeneral website retargeting is the most common way of retargeting. It involves tracking users who’ve interacted with your website (or app) but haven’t converted. \n\nThose actions might include viewing product pages, adding items to a cart, or initiating and abandoning the checkout process.\n\nThese retargeting ads can appear on social media and other websites. And remind users to return to your site and complete a purchase.\n\nSearch Network Retargeting\n\nSearch network retargeting ads are shown to users based on specific keywords they’ve previously searched for. \n\nWhen a user searches for these keywords, your retargeting ads will follow the user around the web: on social media, other websites, as well as search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nFor example, if a user researched online data degrees, they may see this ad the next time they’re browsing a website:\n\nRemarketing Lists for Search Ads\n\nRemarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSA) is a feature from Google Ads that lets you customize your search ad campaign to reach people who’ve visited your site or app.\n\nFor instance, a user might have previously looked at a page with specific ballet flats on a shoe store’s website. Later on, while conducting a search for “comfortable ballet flats,” they may see an ad promoting those same shoes.\n\nTop Platforms for Running Your Retargeting Ads\n\nHere’s an overview of the most common platforms used for retargeting campaigns:\n\nGoogle Ads\n\nGoogle Ads is the biggest advertising platform with powerful retargeting capabilities. \n\nIt allows you to reach potential customers who’ve engaged with your website through the Google Display Network and through Google Search.\n\nMeta Ads Manager\n\nMeta Ads Manager lets you create and manage Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Meta Audience Network ads on desktop and mobile. \n\nMeta retargeting ads use a website tracking pixel to show ads on Meta’s apps to people who have already interacted with your brand on your website or your Facebook page.\n\nX\n\nRetargeting ads on X (formerly Twitter) allow you to reach people who’ve engaged with your website or tweets in the past. \n\nBy implementing the X pixel on your website, you can deliver targeted ads. \n\nLinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn retargeting ads allow you to adapt your messaging based on how users have interacted with your website, ads, or company page on LinkedIn. \n\nYou can use the LinkedIn Insight Tag on your website to retarget users, including event attendees, who haven’t converted to accelerate their buyer’s journey.\n\nBest Practices for Creating Retargeting Ads\nCreate Highly Specific Ads\n\nYour retargeting ad should always match what the user is interested in.\n\nSay your company is a sportswear store. And one customer browses your website for shoes. And another for shorts.\n\nEven though their interests are similar, your best option is to serve them different ads that appeal to exactly what it is they looked at on your website.\n\nUse Landing Pages That Match the Ad\n\nThe landing page users end up on after clicking on the ad should be aligned with the ad. To keep the look and message cohesive and compel the user to buy.\n\nAvoid sending users to your homepage or using landing pages that have too many visuals or distracting navigation links.\n\nInstead, make a landing page that’s welcoming, clear, and product-specific.\n\nHere’s an example.\n\nAd:\n\nAd landing page:\n\nThe design is clean and free of distracting elements. And there’s only one clear call to action (CTA) to start a free trial.\n\nOptimize Your Bidding\n\nInsufficient bidding may have a negative impact on your ad campaigns. So, make sure you’re spending enough to match up with the length of the buyer’s journey.\n\nBecause the type of product or service you’re advertising may influence how long a potential customer is interested. For example, searching for clothing can be a much shorter campaign than searching to buy a house.\n\nThat means you’d need to allocate more money for longer sales cycles.\n\nTarget the Right Audience\n\nMake sure you only target users who are likely to be interested in your product or service.\n\nPlacing a pixel on your homepage to trigger a retargeting campaign probably isn’t a good idea. Because you don’t know what those people are interested in yet.\n\nIt’s better to create custom audiences based on specific interactions, such as product page views or adding items to the cart.\n\nMinimize Ad Fatigue\n\nShowing the same ad to the same users over and over can easily lead to ad fatigue.\n\nIf users keep seeing the same ad repeatedly, they may start ignoring it. Or even become annoyed.\n\nThere are a few things you can do.\n\nOne is to use ad sequencing. Which means showing a series of ads to people in a specific order to tell a story and drive interest.\n\nAnother is to set a frequency cap for your ads. This will limit the number of times an ad can be displayed to the same user within a specified time frame. \n\nThe frequency cap will help you both minimize ad fatigue and reduce ad spend. Because it will eliminate unnecessary impressions that don’t bring in clicks and conversions.\n\nTools for Running a Successful Retargeting Campaign\n\nThe following tools can help you bring in optimal results with your retargeting campaigns:\n\nTraffic Analytics\n\nTraffic Analytics from Semrush can help you learn how your competitors drive traffic to their website and which landing pages are most popular.
