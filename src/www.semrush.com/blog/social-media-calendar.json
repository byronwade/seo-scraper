  "content": "What Is a Social Media Calendar?\n\nA social media calendar is a detailed overview of your upcoming social media posts. It can help you map out a timeline for what you’ll post, where you’ll post it, and when it will go live. \n\nThe simplest social media calendar might just be dates with post titles and the content to include. More advanced calendars may include post times, hashtags, images, and links. \n\nHere’s an example of what a social media calendar can look like from our free template:\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of a Social Media Content Calendar?\n\nA social media content calendar is more than just a schedule. When done well, it can be an indispensable tool for your wider social media strategy. \n\nHere’s why:\n\nIt Saves You Time\n\nA social media calendar lets you plan and schedule lots of social media posts at once. Creating content in batches like this means you don’t waste time multitasking or scrambling for ideas on random days.\n\nPro tip\n\nThe right tools can make managing your social media content calendar even easier. Semrush's Social Poster acts as a smart content calendar, allowing you to plan, schedule, and even create content directly within the platform. \n\nIt's a centralized hub for all your social media activities, helping you stay organized, maintain consistency, and collaborate effectively with your team.\n\nSimplify Your Social Media Calendar\n\nwith Social Poster\n\nTry it Free →\nYou Stick to a Consistent Posting Schedule \n\nIt can be difficult to post consistently on any platform when you’re doing it as and when you have time. Other things get in the way. And it’s tough to remain disciplined.\n\nBut a social calendar helps you post regularly. Keeping your brand at the forefront of your audience’s mind. And giving you consistent opportunities to appear in front of new potential readers and customers.\n\nIt also allows you to plan posts for optimal times. Which can help maximize visibility and engagement.\n\nIt Keeps You Organized\n\nA content calendar keeps all your social media activities in one place. This can help free up bandwidth for other important tasks.\n\nNo more scrambling for last-minute post ideas or forgetting important dates. Like holidays and industry events.\n\nThis methodical organization can improve your productivity. And reduce the stress associated with unplanned or rushed content creation. As you’ll always have a clear view of what’s being posted and where over the coming weeks.\n\nYou Can Stay on Top of Post Quality\n\nSticking to a content calendar gives you the time to review, revise, and perfect your posts. You’re no longer rushing to get content out. And you can put processes in place to double check posts before they go live.\n\nWhich means you can maintain high posting standards and protect your brand’s reputation. By minimizing the chances of mistakes making it to publication. \n\nIt’s Easy for Team Members to Collaborate\n\nA social media content calendar isn’t just for you to use. It’s a collaboration tool for your team.\n\nIt provides a central view of your content plan. And makes it easier to align with broader marketing strategies and ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\nFurther reading: Social Media Management: The Ultimate Guide\n\nHow to Create a Social Media Content Planner\n\nThere are various ways to create a social media calendar depending on what kind of solution you need. The steps below apply whether you’re building one from scratch, adapting a template, or using a tool.\n\nTip\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account to follow along with the steps in this guide.\n\n1. Audit Your Existing Social Content\n\nConducting a social media audit can help you identify what’s working and what’s not. So you can set up your calendar for success from the start.\n\nWhen auditing your social media channels, consider:\n\nYour goals and key performance indicators (KPIs): You need to have a clear plan of what you want to achieve. Like increased traffic to your site, brand awareness, or conversions (like sales).\nWhat posts have performed well in the past: Which posts drive the most traffic/conversions? Which ones get the most engagement?\nWhich platforms your target audience uses most: This helps you decide where to focus your efforts. So you don’t waste your time posting on channels that don’t drive results.\n\nBut how do you find this information?\n\nWe’ll cover choosing the right platforms later in this guide. But setting the right goals is the first steps to creating an effective social media calendar.\n\nSet Social Media Goals\n\nYour social media goals will obviously depend on your wider business goals. Having appropriate goals and KPIs to track gives you a way of measuring your performance. \n\nAnd you can make data-driven decisions based on your content’s performance in line with those metrics.\n\nHere are a few examples to provide some inspiration: \n\nIncreased engagement (e.g., likes, comments, and shares)\nMore website traffic (via links in your social content)\nPost reach (great for brand awareness)\nConversions (like sales or leads)\n\nWhen choosing your goals, consider following the SMART framework. These goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound:\n\nAnalyze Your Successful Content\n\nA big part of creating an effective social media strategy is doubling down on what works well. This means looking at your content that has performed well in the past, and creating more of that.\n\nDepending on the social platform you’re using, you probably have access to some analytics and data about your posts, profile, and engagement levels. For example, here’s an overview of account engagement on Instagram:\n\nAnd here’s what LinkedIn’s analytics dashboard looks like:\n\nBut given one of the main benefits of creating a social media calendar is saving time and staying organized, we can go one step further. And consolidate our Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn analytics all in one place with Social Analytics from Semrush Social.\n\nFirst, connect the accounts you want to analyze. Use our Social Analytics configuration guide for more on how to do this. \n\nIf we use the Facebook tab as an example, you’ll see details about your audience and when they’re online (more on that later).\n\nFor now, head to the “Posts” tab.\n\nThis shows you data about your posts, including engagement rates, link clicks, and more. \n\nUse this data (across Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn) to find which pieces of content performed best. Analyze those pieces of content to understand why they performed well. And weave those winning tactics into your future content.\n\nAnalyze Your Social Media Performance\n\nwith Semrush Social\n\nStart Now →\n2. Choose Your Platforms and Content Mix\n\nYou need to choose social media platforms where your target audience actually spends their time. Otherwise you’re just going to waste your resources.\n\nEach platform has unique audience and content preferences. For example, TikTok is all about short-form vertical videos. Whereas on LinkedIn, written content with engaging images often performs well.\n\nBut how do you know which social media platforms to target with your content calendar?\n\nHow to Choose the Right Platforms\n\nSemrush’s One2Target tool shows you where your target audience is most active. So you can focus on the platforms likely to yield the best results.\n\nJust enter one of your competitors’ domains and click “Analyze.” (Your competitor’s target audience is likely similar to yours.)\n\nYou can find information about your target audience’s demographics and socioeconomics on the relevant tabs. But we want to head to the “Behavior” tab. \n\nThe “Social Media” widget shows you the platforms your target audience visits most often. \n\nUse this data to inform where to spend your resources. For example, if you share a target audience with Amazon, YouTube videos and Facebook posts are likely the best places to start.\n\nNote\n\nAs you gather more data from your campaigns, adjust your strategy accordingly. You may need to adapt your content plans over time based on the channels that drive the best results for your business.\n\nChoosing What to Post on Each Platform\n\nYour content mix will vary depending on factors like your goals, brand, and industry. But there are a few simple systems you can use to help plan out your content.\n\nThe 80/20 rule: 80% of your content informs, entertains or educates your audience. The remaining 20% promotes your products or services. \n\nThe rule of thirds: Dedicate one-third of content to each of the following:\n\nContent you curate from followers (like reviews and posts that tag your business)\nInteraction with followers\nPromotion of products and services\n\nTake Passion Planner, for example. They create posts about their products: \n\nBut they also publish user-generated content:\n\nAnd educational content to help inspire their audience of passionate planners:\n\nAnd relatable memes that resonate with their followers:\n\nThey cover a wide content mix to engage their following. All while keeping everything relevant and not overly promotional.\n\nFor your own content mix, experiment with a wide range of content types:\n\nVideos\nImages\nInfographics\nText-based posts\nTestimonials\nUser-generated content (like sharing follower photos, videos, and reviews)\nLivestreams\n\nBut ensure what you share fits with how people like to consume content on their preferred channels. \n\nFor example, sharing a summary of a blog post might work better on LinkedIn than it would on Instagram or TikTok.\n\n3. Select a Template or Tool to Build the Calendar\n\nThere are three main approaches to building a social media calendar:\n\nBuilding one from scratch: It’s time-intensive, but you can customize it however you like\nAdapting a template: This saves you time, but it might have limited functionality\nUsing a tool: Tools may have limited customization, but using them can significantly speed up your processes\nHow to Build a Social Content Calendar from Scratch\n\nThere are nearly unlimited ways you could create a fully customized social media calendar from scratch.\n\nBut here are a few key things you may want to consider when building yours:\n\nKeep it simple. Your social calendar is meant to save you time. So don’t make it so complicated that it ends up costing you (and your team) time instead.\nUse color coding. This is a simple visual way to make your calendar easier to use. Include a key at the side so you and your team never get lost.\nChoose the right medium. Create your calendar within a platform your team is comfortable with. This makes collaboration much easier.\n\nHave columns for all the key details of each post, including things like:\n\nThe platform to publish on\nPublishing date and time (with time zone if applicable)\nFormat (e.g., vertical video or poll)\nCopy for the post\nVisuals to attach\nLinks to include\nTracking parameters to add (more on that in Step 5)\n\nYour blank calendar might look something like this:\n\nUsing a Template\n\nTemplates are a great way to start planning your social media content immediately. Without having to create your own calendar from scratch.\n\nIf this sounds like the right choice for your setup, check out our free social media calendar template in Google Sheets. \n\nIt has columns for different social media channels, day of the week, topics, copy, visual assets, and more. \n\nUse the default formatting or feel free to customize it any way you like. Schedule your posts by adding the relevant details in each cell. And share the Google Sheet with your team for simple collaboration.\n\nUsing Social Media Calendar Tools\n\nIf you want an all-in-one solution, consider using a tool for your social calendar. There are lots of options out there (we’ll cover a few later). There are dedicated calendar tools, but sometimes a spreadsheet is all you need.\n\nOr you could use something with additional functionality, like a Social Poster tool from Semrush Social.\n\nThis saves you time by letting you schedule posts on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), Pinterest, and even your Google Business Profile. All in one place.\n\n4. Schedule Your Content\n\nCreate a posting schedule that suits your availability and resources. And—importantly—one that puts your content in front of the right people at the right time.\n\nPlan When to Post\n\nFor each platform you use, you need to plan:\n\nWhen to post\nHow often to post\n\nSome social media platforms provide you with helpful data on when your audience is most active. This helps you know when to post for the highest levels of engagement.\n\nHere’s how this looks on Instagram:\n\nSemrush Social provides you with a more detailed view. Showing a chart of when your followers are most active by day and time. And how that correlates to when your posts go live.\n\nIn fact, the in-built 'best time to post' feature in Social Poster, based on real-time analysis of your audience, suggests optimal posting times right when you're scheduling your content.\n\nThis way, you can easily see if you’re posting at the right times (or if you need to adjust your strategy for better reach).\n\nSchedule Posts Ahead of Time\n\nIf you’re using your own content calendar or a template, you’ll need to schedule your content manually. You could post the planned content manually each day, but making use of the scheduling function within your social media platforms saves a lot of time. \n\nThey don’t all offer this ability, but many of the major platforms do. You can schedule posts on X:\n\nAnd on Facebook, through the Business Suite (which also shows a handy timeline view of upcoming posts):\n\nConnect your social accounts, and head to the “Calendar” tab within the Social Poster. Here you'll find a comprehensive calendar view of all your scheduled posts, allowing you to visualize your content plan and make adjustments on the fly with simple drag-and-drop functionality.\n\nTo schedule a new post, hover over the desired date and click the “+” icon. Choose your platforms, craft your post, add visuals and links, and even incorporate UTM parameters for tracking. \n\nWith unlimited post scheduling and the option for bulk scheduling, you can efficiently plan your content in advance. Plus, the handy Chrome extension lets you schedule posts directly from any webpage, making your workflow all the more streamlined. \n\nClick “Schedule” when you’re ready.\n\nThis allows you to schedule posts ahead of time. And see your scheduled posts in a calendar view. All in one place.\n\nPro tip\n\nAdd tags to your post to easily track groups of posts by campaign, category, or anything else you like. Then view their performance in Semrush Social’s Content Insights tool.\n\n5. Track Your Social Performance & Adapt Your Calendar\n\nTrack your social media performance to understand what is working. And what isn’t. This lets you adapt your strategy over time to meet the goals you set in Step 1.\n\nThe most important metrics to track will depend on those goals. But a few helpful ones to consider include:\n\nImpressions: This is the number of people that saw your content, regardless of whether they interacted with it\nLikes/comments/shares: Engagement metrics tell you how well your content is resonating with your target audience\nConversions: This could be sales, leads, or email signups, or any other conversion you track\nWebsite traffic: If you’re sending traffic from your social posts to your website, you can track this data in a tool like Google Analytics\nHow to Track Social Media Engagement \n\nUse engagement data to understand which posts perform best. And replicate what that content does well in future posts. You’ll also be able to understand whether your engagement levels are increasing over time. Or if you need to adapt your approach.\n\nYou’ll be able to see your engagement metrics in your chosen platform’s analytics dashboard. Here’s what that looks like in Pinterest:\n\nWe showed you in Step 1 how the Social Analytics tool within Semrush Social can help you audit your social media content. Before even creating a calendar.\n\nBut it also lets you track performance over time as you implement your campaigns. Head to the tool, and click the “Engagement” tab for an overview of your account’s performance over time.\n\nYou’ll be able to monitor your Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn performance from one dashboard. Keeping tabs on your impressions, reach, and engagement over time. \n\nThis helps you understand how effective your social media calendar is. And also provides insight into the days you get the most engagement. So you can tweak your calendar to post more on the days your content performs best.\n\nTrack Your Social Media Performance\n\nwith Semrush Social\n\nStart Now →\nTracking Conversions\n\nTo track metrics like conversions, you’ll need to have a way of linking a social media post to a given sale or signup. Do this using UTM parameters when scheduling your posts.\n\nUTM parameters are snippets you add to the end of URLs that allow you track campaign performance. Here’s an example of a UTM parameter for a social media campaign:\n\nAdd UTM parameters to the posts you schedule with Social Poster––a part of Semrush Social. When scheduling a new post, click the “UTM” button. Next, add your campaign name, campaign medium, and choose a campaign source (it’ll do this for you automatically).\n\nThen click “Apply to post.”\n\nCheck out our guide to UTM codes in Google Analytics to learn how to analyze this data. And to understand how to use UTM tracking for better social media campaign performance.\n\nHow to Track Social Traffic in GA4\n\nEngaging social media content can drive a lot of traffic to your website. But understanding which platforms do this best requires a bit of data analysis.\n\nSeeing your total social traffic is fairly straightforward within Google Analytics 4. In the property you want to track, click “Reports” > “Life cycle” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”\n\nYou’ll see an overview of your website’s traffic sources. Including “Organic Social” (and “Paid Social” if you’re running ads). You’ll also see metrics like “Average engagement time per session” and “Engaged sessions per user.”\n\nThese are useful for understanding whether the traffic you’re sending to your site from social media is actually engaging with your site’s content.\n\nBut if you’re driving traffic to your site from multiple social media platforms, this data might not be enough. To see more granular data, click “Add filter +” and then select “Session source/medium” in the “Dimension” drop-down.\n\nNext, select “exactly matches” in the “Match Type” drop-down. And then the social media platforms you want to track from the “Value” drop-down. Then click “Apply.”\n\nFinally, in the bottom left drop-down, select “Session source.” This will show you a table with each of the sources you selected. \n\nYou can then compare each source’s engagement metrics to understand which social media platforms drive the most engaged traffic to your website.\n\nTracking your key metrics like this lets you stay on top of what’s working—and what isn’t. Giving you the confidence to double down on the content that performs best. Without wasting your resources.\n\nSocial Media Calendar Tools \nSemrush Social\n\nWe’ve already covered using the Social Poster to schedule your content in Step 4 of our guide above.
