  "content": "What Is Local SEO? \n\nLocal SEO is a set of techniques that can help your local business appear more prominently in unpaid, location-based search results on Google Search, Google Maps, and other search engines. \n\nFor example, it can help your Google Business Profile rank higher in the local pack.\n\nLike this:\n\nAnd boost your website’s rankings in standard “blue link” results. \n\nLike this:\n\nAlmost all search results are personalized based on the user’s country. But local SEO is about reaching people in more specific locations, such as cities and districts.\n\nSo, it can benefit businesses with physical stores (restaurants, dentists, and mechanics, etc.). And local service providers (plumbers, tutors, and dog walkers, etc.). \n\nNote\n\nLocal SEO differs from regular SEO because Google uses some different systems and criteria to rank localized results.\n\nWhy Is Local SEO Important? \n\nGoogle delivers billions of local search results every month. And if you appear prominently for relevant queries, you’re more likely to attract customers.\n\nGoogle displays local results when it believes searchers are looking for products, services or amenities nearby. Or in a specified location.\n\nHere are some examples of local keywords found with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool:\n\n“mexican restaurants”\n“mexican restaurants near me”\n“mexican restaurants in dallas”\n\nBusinesses with the best local SEO tend to rank highest for local keywords like the ones above. So, users are more likely to discover and engage with those companies.\n\nNo matter what your business is or where you’re located, it’s likely that you can reach potential customers through search. \n\nFind Local Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow Local SEO Works \n\nLocal SEO works by helping Google understand where your business is located and what it offers. It can also help Google perceive your business as more popular and trustworthy.\n\nAll these factors can help you rank higher when people search relevant queries.\n\nWhen ranking businesses in Google Maps and the local pack, Google considers three main criteria:\n\nRelevance: How well the business matches what the user is looking for\nDistance: How far the likely search location is from the business location\nProminence: How well-known and well-reviewed the business is\n\nWhen ranking webpages in traditional search results, Google considers factors like:\n\nRelevance: How well your webpage matches what the user is looking for\nQuality: How helpful and trustworthy your content is \nUsability: How strong your webpage’s performance is (based on things like speed and mobile-friendliness)\nHow to Do Local SEO\n\nNow, it’s time to create a plan to increase your local rankings and boost traffic. The following steps will help you get started. \n\nTip\n\nCreate your free Semrush account to follow along with the tutorials below.\n\nDo Local Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research for local SEO is the process of finding search terms people use when searching for local products and services. \n\nRanking for these keywords drives highly targeted local traffic to your site and sends more customers your way. \n\nTo get started, you need a short list of keywords people can use to find your local business. \n\nHere are a few different ways to start.\n\nResearch Your Competitors\n\nSeeing what keywords your competitors rank for is an easy way to start gathering ideas. And you can do that with Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool.\n\nEnter your domain and up to four competitors’ domains. (The tool will provide suggestions to help you.)\n\nThen, choose your target country and click “Compare.”\n\nScroll down to the keyword table and select “Untapped.”\n\nYou’ll see keywords that at least one competitor ranks for but you don’t. So, these could be relevant terms that you’re missing out on.\n\nClick “Advanced filters” to exclude any irrelevant keywords (e.g., keywords that contain your competitors’ business names).\n\nLike this:\n\nYou can also filter based on metrics like:\n\nVolume: The keyword search volume (average number of monthly searches)\nKD%: The keyword difficulty score, which measures how hard it’ll be to earn a high organic ranking and is expressed as a percentage\nIntent: The general purpose behind the search, which can be transactional, commercial, navigational, and/or informational\n\nThis makes it easier to spot the best keywords for your local SEO strategy.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUse Google Autocomplete\n\nGoogle autocomplete is a feature within Google Search that makes it faster to complete searches when you start to type. \n\nIts purpose is to save users time by predicting what they’re going to search for.\n\nAnd it can help you discover valuable long-tail keywords for local SEO. Because Google’s autocomplete predictions depend partly on your location. \n\nFor example, if you’re in Arcadia, California, you’ll see something like this if you type “best paella in” into the search bar:\n\nAll these locations are near Arcadia or in California. \n\nSo, to find valuable local keywords, start typing in keywords related to your business. \n\nFor example, if you run a cleaning service business, type in “cleaning services” to get a list of local keyword suggestions.\n\nLike this:\n\nAnd when you start adding local modifiers like “cleaning services los angeles,” you start to see lots of other useful keywords.\n\nLike this:\n\nKeep trying new combinations of different local keywords. You should have a list of keywords for your local business SEO in no time. \n\nLeverage Google Keyword Planner\n\nGoogle’s Keyword Planner helps you research keywords for paid search campaigns.\n\nBut it’s also great for discovering new keywords related to your business. \n\nStart by going to the “Discover new keywords” section.\n\nClick on the “Start with a website” tab. Then, enter one of your competitors’ domains. \n\nClick “Get results,” and Google will suggest a ton of keywords based on the terms that appear on that website.\n\nRepeat the process with more of your top competitors and add all the relevant keywords to your list. \n\nAnother great Keyword Planner feature: It gives monthly search data for specific locations.\n\nLike so:\n\nThis feature is really helpful when you have lots of keywords and want to decide which to target first.\n\nOptimize Your Google Business Profile\n\nYour Google Business Profile is the free business listing that can appear in Google results. \n\nLike this:\n\nIf you optimize your profile, Google is more likely to rank it highly when prospective customers search for relevant terms. Which means those users are more likely to contact or visit your business.\n\nTo get started, you’ll need to add and/or verify your Business Profile. And fill it out as much as possible. \n\nFor example, you can provide:\n\nContact details\nOpening hours\nPhotos and videos\nBusiness attributes (e.g., Wi-Fi and outdoor seating)\nKeep Your Business Profile Active\n\nKeeping your Business Profile active shows Google and users that you’re an engaged business owner. This can help you get higher rankings and more customers.\n\nMost importantly, keep your business details up to date (e.g., add your holiday hours or change your address the moment you move to a new location).\n\nThis ensures users always have access to correct and comprehensive information.\n\nAlso consider posting on your Business Profile. To inform users about your latest news, events, and offers.\n\nWith Semrush Social, you can easily schedule your posts:\n\nIt’s also a good idea to ask customers for Google reviews. \n\nIf you have more reviews and a higher star rating than your competitors, you stand a better chance of outranking them. And users may be more likely to choose you.\n\nRespond to your Google reviews, too. \n\nThis shows that you care about your customers’ feedback. And gives you the opportunity to counter any negative comments.\n\nWith Semrush’s Review Management tool, you can set up automatic replies using AI.\n\nGet and Monitor Local Citations\n\nCitations are places that mention your name, address, and phone number (NAP) online.\n\nThey usually appear on business directories and social media profiles. \n\nNAP citations are important because Google may use them to verify that your business information is accurate. And that what you say about your business online is true.\n\nLike this:\n\nThe idea is that the more Google sees consistent NAP citations for your business, the more confident it is that your business is legitimate and trustworthy. \n\nSo, you want to get consistent citations on as many trusted websites as you can. \n\nAn easy way to check your local listings and distribute them to the most authoritative directories is to use Semrush’s Listing Management tool. \n\nTo get started, enter your company name. And choose the company with the correct address from the list that appears.\n\nYou’ll see a report of your current online presence. \n\nIncluding the total number of listings, listings to fix, and average star rating. \n\nLike this:\n\nThe tool also has a list of your citations with specific errors (e.g., wrong phone number, wrong address, etc.). \n\nSimply scroll down to find it.\n\nYou can then download all of this information using the \"Export\" button in the top right corner of the list. \n\nIf you have a paid subscription, you can automatically distribute your business information to dozens of directories. \n\nFirst, make sure your listing is up to date.\n\nIf you need to change anything, click the “Edit business info” button.\n\nThen, add additional information like photos, videos, your Google Business Profile cover photo, social media handles, and more.\n\nFollowing that, you’ll see a dashboard with seven tabs:\n\nYour listings (view of all your listings and their current statuses)\nInsights of GBP (see a dashboard that consolidates data from your GBP analytics account)\nDuplicates (see all possible, processed, or removed duplicate listings)\nUser Suggestions (approve or reject customer-suggested changes)\nReview Management (monitor and respond to reviews and ratings for all your locations)\nReview Analytics (keep track of your competitors’ reviews and compare them to yours)\nLocal Rankings (see how well your business ranks for any city location)\n\nIt looks like this:\n\nMake sure all your information is updated and as detailed as possible.\n\nThen, let the tool carry the heavy load of automatically keeping your NAP citations consistent everywhere.\n\nHere are a few NAP citation tips:\n\nKeep all of your citations 100% consistent (exact same name, address, phone number)\nSubmit your information to popular directories in your local area and industry\nSubmit to big players (like Apple Maps, Yelp, Bing Places, Facebook, etc.)\nEncourage and Respond to Online Reviews\n\nReviews provide social proof, validate your expertise, and give potential buyers confidence in your business. \n\nGenerally, you should try to get reviews on Google. Because they’re visible in search results and an important local ranking factor.\n\nBut if customers like to use other platforms (e.g., Tripadvisor), it’s helpful to get reviews there too.\n\nHere are some quick tips for success:\n\nWhen you speak to happy customers, ask them to leave a review on your preferred platform(s)\nCreate posters, business cards, etc. that encourage customers to leave online reviews. Making sure to include a QR code that makes it easy for them to find the right page.\nEmbed widgets on your website that make it easy for visitors to see and leave reviews\nDon’t offer or accept money in exchange for reviews (it’s against terms for Google and many other platforms)\n\nWith Semrush’s Review Management tool, you can track your reviews across multiple platforms.\n\nAnd every week, you’ll get an email alert about any negative reviews. So you can respond to them quickly.\n\nMonitor Your Online Reviews\n\nwith the Review Management Tool\n\nGet Free Report →\nRefine Your On-Page SEO\n\nOn-page SEO is the practice of optimizing your webpages to help them rank higher on organic search results. And it’s indispensable for local search engine marketing. \n\nIf you rank well organically, you likely have strong chances of ranking in the local pack. \n\nTo run a quick audit and gauge your on-page SEO health, use Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker. \n\nEnter your domain and hit “Get ideas.”\n\nFollow the On Page SEO Checker configuration guide to set up your project, and the tool will automatically start running an audit. \n\nAfter a few minutes, it’ll display a dashboard with different on-page factors for you to optimize. \n\nIf you scroll down, you’ll see your pages are conveniently sorted by “Priority.”\n\nOptimize these pages first to get the most impactful results. \n\nClick on the “# ideas” button beside each of the top pages to get more specific optimization ideas.\n\nHere are a few on-page SEO tips:\n\nInclude your locally targeted keywords in page title tags and meta descriptions\nAdd specific location pages to your website to emphasize your local services\nInternally link to and from pages where relevant\n\nFurther reading: Local SEO for Multiple Locations\n\nBuild Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are links on other sites that link back to yours.
