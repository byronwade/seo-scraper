And then transforms it into the resulting content the user sees displayed in the browser. \n\nSimilarly, in an SEO context, search engines will crawl, render, and index a site’s JS content. So it’s discoverable in users’ online search results.\n\nSo what is JavaScript?\n\nJavaScript (JS) is a programming language for creating interactive websites (which contain more engaging user elements than traditional static sites) and web apps. \n\nFurther reading: Understand what JavaScript does and its different applications in our Basic Guide to JS. \n\nJS is one of the most common computer languages for the web, along with HTML and CSS.\n\nWeb developers use JS to add functionality to a site, including:\n\nDynamic content: Any content generated by user input or changes in the website’s backend database. For instance, personalized product recommendations, social media newsfeeds, and weather forecast information.\nAnimations: Examples include image carousels, animated icons, loading animations, and interactive infographics\nForm validation: Websites validate a user’s form input before they submit a form—to check whether the user used a valid password format, for instance. This can improve the user experience (UX) and reduce frustration due to form errors.\n\nTip\n\nDownload our handy cheat sheet for beginners to learn how to use JavaScript code.\n\nHow Browsers Handle JavaScript\n\nWhen you visit a page, a web browser (the software used to access websites) will generally handle JavaScript in three steps:\n\nParsing: The browser’s JavaScript rendering engine analyzes the code script to understand its structure and syntax\nCompiling: The engine converts the script into code that the browser can execute\nExecution: The browser executes code, which results in a fully rendered webpage\nHow Search Engines Render JavaScript\n\nA search engine is software designed to help users search the internet. Different search engines handle JavaScript differently. Let’s see how the most popular ones do it.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle’s JavaScript rendering process takes place in three stages:\n\nCrawling: Discover a new page and download the text and media it contains\nRendering: Execute the JavaScript code to understand the content of the page\nIndexing: Understand what the page is about and include it in the Google index\n\nHere’s a visual summary from Google Search Central of what takes place when Google renders a site’s JS:\n\nGoogle’s web crawler, Googlebot, queues up webpages for crawling and rendering. \n\nFirst, it assesses whether each page can be crawled. Googlebot then checks the rendered page for links. And queues any URLs it finds there for further crawling.\n\nBing\n\nBing doesn’t support all the latest JavaScript frameworks (collections of code libraries) for rendering.\n\nThe search engine’s official recommendation is for websites to use dynamic rendering instead of JavaScript.\n\nWhat is dynamic rendering?\n\nA website detects a visitor’s user agent (user-identifying software) to determine if it’s a human or a search engine crawler. It will render the content differently for humans and search engines.\n\nWhen detecting Bing’s search engine crawler, websites should pre-render the content through server-side rendering (SSR). And then serve a static HTML website to the user.\n\nThe advantage is that it minimizes HTTP requests (requests a user’s browser makes to the server) since the fully rendered page is delivered immediately. \n\nYahoo\n\nYahoo hasn’t disclosed official information on how its search engine renders JavaScript. But it does offer some advice on how websites should handle JavaScript:\n\nDefer JavaScript loading: Execute JS code after the main content of the page loads. This can improve page loading speed.\nMinify JavaScript files: Reduce the size of JS files by removing unnecessary data (like comments and white space). To help the code load faster.\nRemove duplicate scripts: Websites can accidentally end up with duplicate JavaScript files. Check for and remove duplicate scripts to avoid code conflicts and increased page load times.\nYandex\n\nYandex allows webmasters to choose whether to allow the search engine to render the JavaScript code on their pages.\n\nThe search engine recommends that websites use server-side JavaScript rendering.\n\nHow to Check if Googlebot Has Rendered Your Website Properly\n\nIn this section, we’ll focus on the most widely used search engine—and the one that plays a dominant role in SEO.\n\nYou can use the URL inspection feature in Google Search Console (GSC) to check if Google’s web crawler has rendered your website as it should. \n\nClick on the search box at the top of the GSC dashboard, type in your website’s URL, and hit “Enter.”\n\nThe tool will check whether your site has been crawled. And if it’s eligible to appear in Google’s search results.\n\nClick “View Crawled Page.”\n\nNext, click the “Screenshot” tab followed by “Test Live URL.”\n\nThe tool will show you a screenshot of how Googlebot renders your website. \n\nCompare the screenshot with how your website is rendered in the browser to check for any issues.\n\nHow Does JavaScript Impact SEO?\n\nJavaScript rendering can have both positive and negative effects on your website’s SEO performance.\n\nFor instance, interactive website elements and dynamic content updates can provide a better page experience. Which Google tends to reward with better search engine results page (SERP) visibility.\n\nWebsites also use JavaScript to dynamically generate structured data—or schema markup—for webpages. \n\nNote\n\nStructured data is code you add to your pages to help search engines better understand what your content is about. This context helps them display your content in a rich format—making your site stand out on SERPs. Rich content can include images, star ratings, review count, etc.\n\nWhile not a confirmed Google ranking factor, structured data can play a part in improving your search engine visibility.\n\nBut, without proper implementation of JavaScript code, JS rendering can have its SEO downsides. \n\nThe results?\n\nReduced page load speed: Websites will be slower to load. And we knowpage speed has been a Google ranking factor for years.\nCrawling issues: Search engines sometimes have problems crawling and indexing pages that contain JavaScript. Which can lead to reduced site visibility in search engine results.\nDuplicate content: Issues occur when the same webpage has different formats e.g., as a page with JavaScript rendering and as a static HTML page. Search engines won’t know which version to display in search results and can end up showing both. Duplicate content may appear on the site, too.\n\nPro tip\n\nMake your JS website easier for search engines to crawl, render, and index by following the best practices in our JavaScript SEO guide.\n\n3 Methods for Handling JavaScript Rendering \n\nIf your website uses JavaScript (and it most likely does), one crucial aspect you need to figure out is how it will render JS code. This decision can ultimately affect your website’s performance and the overall user experience.\n\nThere are three JavaScript rendering methods you can choose from: client-side rendering, server-side rendering, and static site generation.\n\nAll three methods have their pros and cons, which we’ll get into next.\n\nClient-Side Rendering (CSR)\n\nIn CSR, JavaScript code is executed in the user’s browser instead of on the server side. \n\nWhen a user visits a website, the site’s server responds with an HTML file containing only the basic structure of the page. Along with links to JS and CSS files. \n\nThe user’s browser then downloads the files and executes them locally, rendering the website.\n\nPros and Cons of Client-Side Rendering (CSR)\n\nThe advantages of CSR include:\n\nReduced server load: Rendering JavaScript in the user’s browser reduces the overall load on the server, which can avoid issues with server performance\nImproved website performance: After the initial page load, subsequent page updates tend to be faster. The reason: CSR allows page content updates without having to reload the page.\nOffline functionality: Once a page’s initial resources download, CSR lets users access the page even without an internet connection.\n\nBut CSR also comes with its set of disadvantages:\n\nIncreased initial load time: With CSR, it’s necessary to download and execute JavaScript code on the user’s device before rendering a page. This can prolong the initial page load time—likely resulting in worse UX.\nCrawling and indexing issues: CSR can make it more difficult for search engines to crawl and index pages containing JavaScript. Potentially negatively affecting a site’s search engine visibility.\nDevice-dependent performance: Since it relies on code execution on the user’s device, CSR can perform poorly on older devices \nServer-Side Rendering (SSR)\n\nSSR works by having JavaScript executed on the website’s server. \n\nFirst, a user visits a URL using their browser. The browser requests the webpage from the server. And the server renders the page completely, sending it back to the browser.\n\nPros and Cons of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) \n\nJavaScript server-side rendering offers:\n\nImproved crawlability and indexing: Search engines will be able to render HTML content in its entirety when crawling pages\nFaster initial load time: Rendering the page in its entirety on the server, then sending it to the user’s browser results in faster initial load times. Due to the user’s browser not having to download and execute the JavaScript by itself.\nIncreased security: SSR reduces input on the user’s side. Which makes websites less susceptible to cross-site scripting (malicious parties injecting harmful code onto an otherwise trusted website) and other types of cyber attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the main disadvantage of server-side rendering is it can cause a heavier load on a website’s server, especially during periods of high traffic. This can slow down your website or even make it inaccessible.\n\nStatic Site Generation (SSG)\n\nWith SSG, websites are served as static files—meaning exactly as stored on the website’s server and without any server-side processing. \n\nRendering happens on the website’s server. But unlike in SSR, it occurs before a user even makes a request.\n\nPros and Cons of Static Site Generation (SSG)\n\nStatic site generation allows for:\n\nImproved page load speed: Static site generation can significantly improve load speeds compared to other types of rendering\nSEO-friendliness: Search engines can crawl static sites more easily, which enables faster indexing and ranking\nCost-effectiveness: Compared to dynamic websites, static sites require fewer resources to operate\n\nStatic site generation also has a couple of downsides:\n\nLack of dynamic functionality: It can be difficult to implement dynamic functionality (such as personalized or user-generated content) on static websites\nContent management issues: It’s more complex to manage content on static sites since every change requires coding. Unlike dynamic sites, which can easily enable updates via a content management system (CMS).\nHow to Analyze Your JavaScript Website\n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to uncover various issues that could prevent your JS-powered website from achieving higher search engine rankings.\n\nEnter your website domain and click “Start Audit” to check your site.\n\nYou’ll be able to customize settings for the audit, including:\n\nThe user agent you want the tool to use when crawling your website\nHow many pages to check per audit\nSpecific pages you’d like to analyze (or exclude)\n\nMake sure to enable JavaScript rendering in the “Crawler settings” section.\n\nThen, click on “Start Site Audit.” The tool will generate a report detailing the overall health of your website.\n\nClick the “Issues” tab. Type “JavaScript” in the search box to filter by JS-related concerns.\n\nFrom here, select any issue to review the list of pages that have it. Some common problems you might encounter are:\n\nBroken JavaScript files: JS files that have stopped running for some reason. Review these files and fix any issues (or remove them from your website altogether).\nUnminified JavaScript files: Files containing unnecessary lines, white space, and comments that increase file size. Use a tool like Minifier to reduce their size and have them load faster.\nUncached JavaScript files: This issue occurs when a website doesn’t have browser caching (a mechanism for downloading and storing files on the user’s device for repeated use) enabled for JS files. Enable browser caching on your site so files won’t need downloading multiple times by the user’s browser, slowing down page load times.\n\nAlternatively, click “Why and how to fix it” next to each issue type to learn how to address it.\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account today to start improving your JS website’s technical and organic performance.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign up Now →",
