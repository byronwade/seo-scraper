  "content": "Marketing calendars keep marketing activities organized and moving toward the finish line. \n\nWhen used correctly, they can lead to better results. And help you plan further in advance.\n\nThis article will show you how to build a marketing calendar that helps you accomplish your marketing goals.\n\nWe’ll discuss the major components of marketing calendars, the different types, and even provide some templates to help you get started.\n\nWhat Is a Marketing Calendar?\n\nA marketing calendar is a detailed schedule of all your past, current, and future marketing activities. \n\nIt includes all of the tasks associated with your marketing plan. And is used by all the team members involved in executing those tasks.\n\nHere’s a marketing calendar example:\n\nMarketing teams use calendars to manage internal workflows, assign tasks to team members, and set deadlines for marketing projects like ad campaigns and white papers. \n\nYou can also use marketing calendars to track occasions (like holidays) for generating relevant seasonal content. \n\nThere are many types of marketing calendars. But they share a common goal: to keep marketing activities on schedule. \n\nWhy Is a Marketing Calendar Important?\n\nA marketing calendar helps with completing marketing projects by or ahead of deadline. Plus, they give every team member visibility into the progress of activities. \n\nAnyone who has access to the calendar can know exactly what’s going on. \n\nBecause there are many people involved in planning, executing, and delivering marketing projects. An SEO strategist, a content manager, a content writer, a graphic designer, and a web developer may all work on a single piece of content. \n\nSo, marketing calendars help teams avoid delays, miscommunication, and letting tasks slip through the cracks by:\n\nImproving communication among team members\nBreaking down campaigns or projects into smaller steps\nAssigning deadlines that create accountability\nAllowing for the easy tracking of projects\nHelping track occasions to generate relevant, seasonal content \n\nFor remote teams or teams that use freelancers to create content marketing content, well-organized marketing calendars are even more crucial. They keep team members working across time zones or outside of business hours up-to-date on the status of projects.\n\nDifferent Types of Marketing Calendars\n\nIt’s possible to have just one marketing calendar. But many teams have multiple so they can keep track of important dates and activities needed to execute their marketing strategy. \n\nThe more marketing activities you have going on, the more you might want to consider using multiple calendars. \n\nHere are some of the most common types of marketing calendars:\n\nEditorial Calendar\n\nAn editorial calendar (often called a content calendar or content marketing calendar) helps teams plan, write, and publish content. \n\nIt’s a must for companies that produce a lot of blog content. Like Salesforce:\n\nBut ebooks, white papers, and case studies are also examples of content that would be in an editorial calendar. Some include social media content in their editorial calendars as well.\n\nBecause there are so many types of content marketing, these calendars often include details like article titles, target keywords, and links to detailed content briefs. To help differentiate them.\n\nAnd editorial calendars can help marketers create valuable content for their target audience on a more consistent basis. As long as you keep them populated with content ideas or article topics that your target audience is interested in. \n\nTip: To get content ideas for your own editorial calendar, use Topic Research. Just enter a topic to get tons of ideas you can create content around.\n\nSocial Media Marketing Calendar\n\nA social media marketing calendar helps marketers plan, manage, and schedule their social media posts. And across multiple platforms. \n\nHere’s a sample social media calendar:\n\nThese calendars often include copy, hashtags, and links to images or videos to include in each post. Along with the scheduled post date. \n\nIt’s also a good idea to include time of day for posts based on the performance metrics you have about when your target audience is most active.\n\nRegularly posting social media content is crucial to growing your following on those channels. So, these calendars can help teams keep up their posting frequency, as long as they are continually populated with new content for posts.\n\nEmail Marketing\n\nThese calendars help with scheduling your email marketing campaigns. \n\nThey may include information like email subject lines, links to templates, and audience segments. And even the intended call to action (CTA)—the action you want users to take (see the image below).\n\nThe more robust your email marketing strategy, the more important this calendar is. \n\nIt helps ensure the emails include all of the information needed to be most effective. And that those emails are sent to the right audiences.\n\nCampaign Calendar\n\nA campaign calendar outlines tasks and deadlines associated with specific marketing or client campaigns.\n\nMarketing campaign calendars can include a combination of deliverables (ads, emails, landing pages, etc.) completed over the course of weeks or months. And because campaigns often have a clear start and end date, they can keep marketing teams organized throughout the campaign’s duration. \n\nThey can be very useful to marketing agencies who manage campaigns for multiple clients at the same time. Like the campaigns tracked below in the project management platform, Monday.\n\nIt’s also a good idea for campaign calendars to include tasks and deadlines for reporting. This is when your team does the work of collecting and analyzing performance data.\n\nAlthough reporting comes after marketing activities are completed, it should still be considered a central campaign task. You don’t want it to fall through the cracks, so add it to your calendar.\n\nHoliday Calendar\n\nHoliday calendars track days, weeks, and months of celebration or awareness (Flag Day, Teacher’s Appreciation Week, National Cancer Prevention Month, etc.). \n\nWhy track holidays for marketing?\n\nBecause holidays present great opportunities to create seasonal, relevant content across all marketing channels. Especially for social media and email marketing, where users expect to engage with timely content.\n\nIn general, holidays are great opportunities for businesses to increase traffic and conversions through holiday promotions, seasonal gift guides, or holiday deals and sales.\n\nFor example, a donut shop can take advantage of National Donut Day (June 7) in the U.S. to connect with its target audience.\n\nThese calendars can be quite extensive. And the dates can change from year to year. \n\nIf you use Google Calendar, many of these dates are listed already. And you can easily add more for other countries by clicking the “+” icon next to “Other calendars” and choosing “Browse calendars of interest.”\n\nThen click the “Browse all” drop-down menu under “Regional holidays.”\n\nWhat Should a Marketing Calendar Include?\n\nHere’s what every project entered into a marketing calendar should include:\n\nProject name: The official name so that everyone using the calendar can easily identify projects\nProject description: The details that team members need to successfully complete their tasks\nTasks/deliverables: The individual tasks or content pieces that need to be completed\nTask owners/assignees: The team members responsible for the execution of individual tasks, deliverables, or content\nStatus: The current status of the project, which should be actively updated and easy to find at a glance\nDeadlines: The date that tasks or campaigns should be completed in their entirety\n\nWe recommend including these items in all marketing calendars, regardless of type. Not only for organization, but to ensure your processes can be repeated as your marketing team grows.\n\nRemember, these are high-level items that are important for all calendars. But the details of a marketing calendar will obviously depend on its type.\n\nFor example, an editorial calendar with SEO content should include target keywords. \n\nAnd social media marketing calendars should include hashtags or other account tags that need to be included in posts.\n\nAlso, some tools may limit what details can be included (but more on those later) .\n\nHow to Build a Marketing Calendar\n\nHere’s a roadmap for building a marketing calendar. And remember: the goal is better organization. So make sure to consider what works best for your current team. \n\n1. Determine Your Marketing Strategy and Marketing Plan\n\nYou need a defined marketing strategy and marketing plan before you can even think about building a calendar. \n\nYour marketing strategy refers to the purpose of your marketing (or the goals you want to achieve). A goal might be increasing website traffic or earning more sales through email marketing.\n\nDeveloping a marketing strategy usually also includes:\n\nDetermining messaging\nChoosing marketing channels\nDeciding on content types\n\nYour marketing strategy will then inform your marketing plan, or all of the marketing activities you will execute to reach the strategic goal. These are the activities that will be added to your marketing calendar.\n\nFor example, to increase website traffic to a real estate website (the goal), you may plan to write and publish ten blog posts about the home-buying process (the plan).\n\nTo earn more sales from email marketing (the goal), you might create several holiday emails that include promotions and CTAs to your product pages (the plan), like below:\n\nOnce your plan is in place, then you can start building the calendar. Mapping out the specific dates, team members, and tasks required to complete each activity.\n\n2. Choose a Tool to Build Your Calendar\n\nThere are many applications and platforms available to build your calendar. Google sheets, Excel, and Microsoft Outlook are commonly used by marketing teams. So are larger project management platforms like Asana and Monday. \n\nWhen choosing a tool for building your calendar, consider the following questions: \n\nCan my team easily collaborate in this tool?\nIs this tool easy to use and navigate?\nCan I include all of the information my team needs to complete their tasks?\nAre users notified if any changes are made to the calendar?\nWill this improve communication and organization for my team?\n3. Identify Tasks & Deadlines\n\nNext, you need to break your activities into tasks with specific deadlines. They should all build toward the final goal. And the deadlines should offer realistic timeframes for execution.\n\nFor example, here is an example of individual tasks and timeframes for completing a blog post:\n\nThree days for the writer to research, plan, and write\nTwo days for editorial review\nOne day for image creation\nOne day for final review\n\nThe timeframes you choose for tasks will depend on the content type. An ebook or white paper usually takes longer to develop than a social media post. Timeframes may also depend on the size or resources of your team.\n\nThere will be times when deadlines have to be adjusted, of course. But don’t get in the habit of tweaking. Remember, the goal here is consistency. \n\nSet firm deadlines. And more importantly, stick to them. \n\n4. Assign Tasks to Marketing Team Members\n\nAfter you identify your tasks, you need to assign them to specific team members. Your calendar should make it very clear who’s responsible for what. \n\nLike this:\n\nIdentifying each task owner ensures the other team members know who to turn to when they need that deliverable or have questions about it.\n\nDepending on your marketing team workflow, it may be a manager who assigns out tasks. Or, maybe team members sign up for them. \n\nDepending on the tool you use, team members may get notified when they have been assigned a task. And those team members can then use the calendar to update their team on when those tasks are completed. \n\n5. Keep the Calendar Standardized and Up to Date\n\nYour marketing calendar should be regularly updated. So everything is reflected accurately. It’s also good to standardize the calendar so it’s easier to organize, use, and replicate.\n\nYou can keep the calendar standardized by:\n\nIdentifying a team member to manage the calendar. They should be responsible for adding activities, assigning tasks, and setting deadlines. Too many people making changes can result in delays, mistakes, and missed deadlines.\nCreating standards for how activities are broken down into tasks. Every blog post should have the same set of tasks. So should every ad campaign. And so on. This creates consistency and repeatability.\nDetermining a cadence for updating the calendar. This might be daily, weekly or monthly. Remember that activities with faster turnaround times may require a faster cadence.\nArchiving projects after completion. It should be clear which projects on your calendar have been completed and which are still in progress. And it’s best not to delete past campaigns or projects. They can be used to build out future projects in a standardized way.\n5 Marketing Calendar Templates\n\nLet’s take a look at marketing templates housed in spreadsheets that you can use to get started. This is a good first step if you aren’t ready to invest in a tool just yet.\n\nBlogging Editorial Calendar Template\n\nThis template can be used to organize and schedule your blog content. \n\nIt includes due dates, drafts, blog topics, authors, target keywords, target audiences, and CTAs.\n\nThis calendar is useful for websites that produce a lot of blog content, particularly for SEO purposes.
