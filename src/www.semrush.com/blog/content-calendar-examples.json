  "content": "In this guide, we’ll share content calendar examples and provide all the information you need to create your own content calendar.\n\nWhat Is a Content Calendar?\n\nA content calendar is a document used to plan and visualize the publication of digital content (such as blog posts, social media posts, and email newsletters) over the coming weeks, months, or year. \n\nTypically, the calendar will show:\n\nWhat content will be published\nWhen and where each piece of content will be published\nWho’s responsible for each task\nLinks to content assets (e.g., copy and images)\n\nHere’s a peek at one of our content marketing calendar examples:\n\nContent calendars are usually created in spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel), calendar apps (e.g., Google Calendar), or specialized tools (e.g., CoSchedule).\n\nNote\n\nA content calendar is a specific type of marketing calendar. In the publishing industry, content calendars are typically called editorial calendars.\n\nWhy Do You Need a Content Calendar?\n\nIf your business produces digital content, there are seven key benefits of creating a content calendar:\n\nProduce better content. By planning ahead, you can give yourself or your team ample time to create each piece of content. And publish at the most opportune times.\nIncrease time efficiency. You’ll have timelines and deadlines set for the content creation process, which keep your stakeholders on task.\nHelp manage resources. Once you know what content to create, you can determine what resources you’ll need to publish your content. Or you can make plans based on the resources available.\nAlign team members. Content calendars allow everyone on the team to know who’s doing what and when. This means they can plan and execute tasks more effectively.\nClarify responsibilities within your team. Content planning determines who will be responsible for each part of the creation process. Ensuring efficiency and accountability.\nAssist with reporting. A content marketing calendar makes it easy to visualize content production over time and see how this correlates with performance trends.\nKeep marketing messaging consistent. Planning your content makes it easier to keep your messaging consistent across your platforms. \nHow to Create a Content Calendar\n\nWhen creating your content calendar, you’ll need to start by choosing a tool that makes sense to you and your team.\n\nThen, follow these steps:\n\n1. Establish a Time Frame\n\nDetermine how far in advance you want to plan your content. It’s common for businesses to plan content over the month, quarter, or year. \n\nYou might find it more manageable to plan content over the month or quarter. This gives you enough time to research and develop detailed content. \n\n2. Specify Your Marketing Channels\n\nSpecify what marketing channels you will distribute your content through.\n\nYour calendar can help you publish content consistently and evenly across your marketing channels, enabling you to maintain contact with your audience.\n\nYou’ll also know to tailor your content to each channel. \n\nDon’t forget to include all of the different channels your company uses, such as:\n\nBlogs and website content\nSocial media\nEmail marketing\nPrint marketing\nSEO\nPPC\n3. Identify Key Topics\n\nMap out any relevant topics you can reference in your content. Try to stick to subjects that are useful to your audience and consistent with your brand identity.\n\nFor example, a gym business might create content around health, fitness, and wellness.\n\n4. Record Notable Events\n\nPlan for any holidays or special events that occur during the set period. \n\nYou might not create content about each holiday, but keeping track of them can help you schedule your posts more intentionally.\n\nBe sure to note any:\n\nNational holidays\nAwareness days\nPeak buying seasons\nCompany events (e.g., product launches)\n\nYou could even create a dedicated holiday calendar like this:\n\n5. Decide on a Posting Schedule\n\nHow often are you able to post content? Your frequency should be often enough to keep your audience engaged, but not so much so that you overwhelm them with content.\n\nAssign each post a publication date and time. You can use your content calendar to keep track of these posts, so you can quickly review how often you post daily or weekly.\n\nIf you’re new to sharing content, it’s common to publish a handful of content pieces every month. As you grow as a business, your content output will likely need to increase, too. \n\nWhen to Post on Social Media\n\nMost brands publish social media content at least four times per week, according to Hubspot's State of Marketing Trends Report.\n\nHere’s the full breakdown for B2B and B2C brands:\n\n \t\n\nB2B\n\n\t\n\nB2C\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\t\n\nFour to six times per week\n\n\t\n\nEvery day\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\t\n\nEvery day\n\n\t\n\nFour to six times per week\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\t\n\nEvery day\n\n\t\n\nEvery day\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\t\n\nFour to six times per week\n\n\t\n\nFour to six times per week\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\t\n\nEvery day\n\n\t\n\nFour to six times per week\n\nThe same research indicated that Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays are best for engagement. While 6 to 9 p.m. is the optimal posting time.\n\nTip\n\nUse Semrush’s Social Analytics tool to find out when your Facebook and Instagram followers are online.\n\nWe recommend testing different schedules and posting frequencies to find what works best for you.\n\nWhen to Send Email Marketing\n\nMany B2B email marketers send campaigns on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday mornings. The idea is that professionals are less likely to be busy or out of office during these times.\n\nIn the B2C industry, it might make sense to send emails on evenings and weekends. When the average person has time to handle their personal inbox.\n\nIf your email marketing platform allows it, use A/B testing to send the same campaign to half your recipients at one time and the other half at another time. Then, see which one generates the best open and click-through rates.\n\nWhen to Post on Your Blog\n\nIdeally, it’s helpful to publish a new blog post once a week. You can always work your way up if you don’t have dedicated time or a team to help you develop your blog content.\n\nThe best time to post might be determined by your subject matter.\n\nFor example, if you’re writing about a trending topic, you might want to publish as soon as possible. And capitalize on the topic’s momentum.\n\nYou can always share your blog posts via other channels (e.g., email marketing and social media) to capture audiences at different times of day.\n\nContent Calendar Examples and Templates\n\nGet inspiration for your own planning with these content calendar examples—all created using our free templates.\n\nContent Marketing Calendar Example and Template\n\nThis example content calendar was created on Google Sheets:\n\nIt features various types of content marketing, including blog posts, videos, and podcasts.

Use a platform that facilitates cloud-based collaboration. So everyone gets access to the same version of the document and has the chance to provide feedback.\nBe adaptable. While it’s helpful to plan ahead, it’s sometimes important to react quickly. Don’t be afraid to change your calendar if new opportunities or challenges arise.\nKeep details updated. Update your calendar when there’s a change of plan (e.g., the publishing date gets delayed) or you hit a progress milestone. So everyone has access to the right information.\nReview your strategy. Gather regular feedback on your content calendar to see whether there’s room for improvement. For example, you might decide to move from monthly to quarterly planning.\nConsider resources. Before each planning period, take stock of the resources (e.g., advertising budgets, staff hours, and tools) available. So you can plan accordingly.\nSchedule time for planning. Put time aside to complete your content calendar each period. It’s harder to take a structured and effective approach when you’re planning ad hoc.\nAssign roles and responsibilities. Make sure everyone on the team knows what’s expected of them. And provide realistic deadlines wherever possible.\nTurning Effective Plans Into Effective Content\n\nEffective content planning means nothing without effective execution.\n\nSo, check out our guide to creating quality content.\n\nAnd test out some of the best content creation tools, including:\n\nSEO Writing Assistant: Check your content’s SEO, originality, readability, and tone of voice\nAI Writing Assistant: Generate 75+ types of content, including images and email newsletters\nAI Social Content Generator: Create videos, carousels, and posts for social media platforms\n\nAccess the Best Tools\n\nfor Content Planning and Creation\n\nSign up Now →",
