  "content": "What Is SEO Copywriting?\n\nSEO copywriting is the process of writing content that’s optimized for human readers and search engine algorithms. The main goals are earning high rankings for relevant keywords, and attracting and engaging target audiences.\n\nTraditionally, copywriting is writing text for advertisements. But many marketers use “copywriting” as another word for content writing, which involves writing blog posts etc.\n\nHere are 10 SEO copywriting tips you should use on your website.\n\n10 Tips for SEO Copywriting Success\n1. Find the Right Keywords\n\nKeywords are words or phrases people enter into search engines to find information or products. \n\nAnd finding the right keywords can help you create content that ranks well in Google and drives organic (search engine) traffic to your site. \n\nStart by targeting specific keywords that are relevant to your niche and have low competition. \n\nYou can use a keyword research tool like Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nEnter a primary (or seed) keyword, choose your country, and hit “Search.”\n\nA seed keyword is a broad keyword from your niche that you can use to find other keyword ideas. \n\nFor example, if you run an SEO agency, you might use “local SEO” as a seed keyword. \n\nYou’ll see a list of related keywords sorted by monthly search volume. And other information, including search intent, keyword difficulty, and more. \n\nFilter by keyword difficulty by clicking on the “KD%” drop-down.\n\nNote: KD% refers to how difficult it will be to rank on page one of Google for a particular keyword.\n\nStart by creating content around the keywords in the “Possible,” “Easy,” and “Very Easy” ranges first. \n\nFor a full walkthrough, read our ultimate guide to keyword research.\n\n2. Find Questions People Ask\n\nA search engine’s top priority is to connect people with helpful information. \n\nWhich is why Google continues to develop SERP features—elements on the search engine results page (SERP) that help searchers quickly find what they’re looking for. \n\nOne of those features is the “People Also Ask” block. It gives users additional questions related to their search. And quick answers to them. \n\nLike this:\n\nBrowsing this search feature is a great way to find additional questions people have about a topic. \n\nSo you can then create content that directly answers these questions. \n\nSeveral tools can help you find questions related to your keywords:\n\nAlsoAsked\nAnswerThePublic\nQuora\n\nBut other tools can help you take it a step further. \n\nSemrush’s Topic Research tool provides even more information, like popular headlines, questions, and related searches. \n\nStart by entering your topic (main keyword) and clicking “Get content ideas.” \n\nThe tool will show cards with popular subtopics. \n\nClick on any card and you’ll see a list of the top questions and headlines. And related searches at the bottom.\n\nUse these results to create content entirely focused on your audience’s needs and interests.\n\nFind questions people ask and more\n\nwith the Topic Research tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Identify and Satisfy Search Intent\n\nFinding a keyword’s search intent means identifying the purpose of someone’s search.\n\nAnd satisfying intent is crucial because search quality is one of Google’s main goals. It’s all about giving users what they want. \n\nWhich means:\n\nIf you want to rank on Google, you need to identify and satisfy search intent for every page you publish.\n\nThere are four main types of keyword search intent:\n\nInformational: Users want to learn more about a specific topic, product, or industry. Example: “what is specialty coffee?”\nNavigational: Users want to find a specific site or page. Example: “Nespresso login.”\nCommercial: Users want to research before making a purchase. Example: “best coffee machines.”\nTransactional: Users want to buy a product or service. Example: “buy a Nespresso coffee machine.”\n\nYou can easily find a keyword’s intent by typing it into Keyword Overview. \n\nYou’ll see it clearly identified in the box labeled “Intent.” \n\nYou can also find search intent during the keyword research process if you’re using the Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nRead our guide to search intent to learn how to integrate search intent into your content strategy. \n\n4. Check Competitors’ Articles for Your Target Keywords\n\nInstead of guessing which keywords to target or what content to create, check what’s already working for your competitors. \n\nAnd build upon that. \n\nStart by identifying keywords your competitors are ranking for but you aren’t. \n\nEach of those keywords represents an opportunity for you to capture more traffic. \n\nFirst, head to Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool. Then, enter your domain in the first “Root domain” field. \n\nAnd up to four of your top competitors’ domains below. \n\nThen, hit “Compare.” \n\nScroll down to see a list of keywords. \n\nClick “Missing” to filter for keywords all your competitors currently rank for and you don’t. \n\nUse the KD% (keyword difficulty) column to sort for higher-volume keywords that are also easier to rank for. \n\nPrioritize these keywords in your content strategy. \n\n5. Create Linkable Assets\n\nA linkable asset is a piece of content that tends to naturally earn backlinks. (And high-quality backlinks are great for SEO.)\n\nExamples of linkable assets include original research, case studies, and in-depth guides. \n\nBut knowing what content format to choose for a linkable asset can be tricky. \n\nAn effective tactic is to see what people in your industry are already linking to. \n\nStart by looking at your competitors’ backlink profiles.\n\nGo to Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool, enter one of your competitors’ domains, and click “Analyze.” \n\nThen, click on the “Indexed Pages” tab. These are the pages with the most backlinks. \n\nRepeat this process for your top competitors. And look for patterns in the top linked pages. \n\nFor example:\n\nAre they writing about controversial subjects?\nIs their format more short-form or long?\nAre they using lots of images and videos or just text?\n\nUse the answers to these questions as a guide for your content strategy. For example, if people in your niche tend to share listicles, create one. \n\nJust make sure to create content that’s better than your competitors’. So people are more likely to link to you.\n\n6. Optimize Headers, Title Tags, and Meta Descriptions\n\nWhen looking at SERPs, people first see a page’s title tag and meta description.\n\nAnd once on the page, they’ll probably scan the headers before reading the content. \n\nWhich means:\n\nOptimizing for these on-page SEO elements can improve your organic click-through rate (CTR) and user experience.\n\nNote: Google may change your title or meta description on the SERP depending on the user’s query. Or cut them off if they are too long.\n\nHowever, it’s still important to optimize both because they can influence users to click on your result.\n\nHere are a few best practices for your title tags, meta descriptions, and headers:\n\nTitle Tags\nEnsure every page has a unique title tag that includes the target keyword\nKeep title tags under 55 to 60 characters long. (Google will cut off longer ones.)\nAccurately describe the content to satisfy search intent. Users will bounce if content doesn’t match their expectations.\nMeta Descriptions\nAlways include the page’s target keyword. Meta descriptions don’t directly impact rankings, but they can impact a user’s decision to click.\nInclude calls-to-action (CTAs) to entice users to click\nKeep meta descriptions under 120 characters. (Google cuts them off after this point on mobile.)\nAccurately describe the webpage—each page’s meta description should be unique\nHeaders\nWrite descriptive H1 tags. They help search engines (and users) learn about your page and its content.\nEnsure every important page has a unique H1 tag\nUse your headings to create hierarchy and structure\n\nOptimizing is important. But so is regularly checking your site for errors. \n\nYou can do so with a tool like Semrush’s Site Audit.\n\nEnter your homepage’s URL and click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nHead over to the “Issues” tab to browse all the errors. \n\nUse the search bar to quickly filter the list. \n\nFor example, you can type “meta” to see all meta description errors, “title” for title tags, and “header” for all headings. \n\nFix any errors and keep your SEO copywriting efforts running smoothly. \n\nTip: Read our instructions for setting up a Site Audit if you don’t already have an active project.\n\n7. Create Organized, Easy-to-Read Content\n\nPeople use search engines to look for answers or advice. \n\nWhich means they want information quickly. Without sifting through complex paragraphs.\n\nLet’s dive into a few ways to make your copy more organized and easier to read. \n\nGood Structure\n\nGood structure guides readers (and search engines) through your content as smoothly as possible. \n\nEach new section on your page should be reflected by H2, H3, and/or H4 headings. \n\nReaders usually skim articles before reading, so headers should tell them what they’re going to find.\n\nAs you can see, optimized headers make it easy to find specific information:\n\nThink about search intent. Show the reader exactly what they’ll find in each section. And help them skip to the section that’s most important to them. \n\nClear and Informative Paragraphs\n\nAs with headers, readers like to skim through paragraphs to find the information they need. Quickly. \n\nBig walls of text are daunting and challenging to scan. \n\nTo combat this, write short paragraphs and start with the main idea first. In other words, use journalism’s inverted pyramid. \n\nStart with the most important point or recommendation. Then add context, examples, arguments, etc. \n\nThis principle, also known as BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front), makes content much easier to follow and skim. \n\nApply it to the body content, as well as introductions and all headings. \n\nShort Sentences\n\nWrite shorter sentences. You’ll make your point faster. \n\nYou are once again making the reader’s job easier. And your message more digestible.\n\nSimple Vocabulary\n\nUnless you’re writing about a highly technical topic, avoid jargon. \n\nThink like your reader—will they know what you’re talking about if you use technical terms or acronyms?\n\nUse simpler words and phrases whenever possible.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nSentence with jargon: “Create content that moves users further down your sales funnel.”\n\nHow to fix it: “Create content that encourages users to make a purchase.”\n\nBoth are technically correct. But the second option is more concise and easier to understand for the average reader.\n\nFine-Tuning Your Content\n\nWhen copywriting for SEO, it’s important to fine-tune your copy’s readability, tone of voice, intent, and more. \n\nUse a tool like Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant to do so.\n\nYou can copy and paste your text into the tool for an instant readability score. \n\nThe SEO Writing Assistant analyzes your text for complexity. And compares it to your top 10 organic rivals. \n\nWith this tool, SEO copywriters can also do the following:\n\nFind sentences that are too long and difficult to read\nCheck for plagiarism \nEnsure the text targets specific keywords\nValidate that the SEO copy aligns with your business’s tone of voice\n\nGet SEO copywriting recommendations\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\n8. Include Visuals\n\nUse visuals throughout your page—videos, images, charts, infographics, etc. \n\nLike in this blog post from Backlinko:\n\nThe use of visual elements can increase a reader’s time on page and trigger them to share on social media. \n\nAnd always follow image SEO best practices. \n\nFor example:\n\nUse descriptive filenames for your images\nCompress images to reduce their file size\nAdd image structured data\nOptimize image alt text\n9. Include CTAs (Calls-to-Action)\n\nOne primary purpose of copywriting for SEO is to move users closer to a conversion (e.g., buying something or filling out a form).\n\nThis is where CTAs come in handy. \n\nRemember “search intent”? \n\nA user will (ideally) land on your page for a reason. If they were looking for informational content, you might want them to move to a product page next.\n\nUse CTAs to show your users what they may be looking for next. You can use simple links, buttons, images, and more.\n\nLike this:\n\nFrom a copywriting perspective, this can improve your copy’s conversion rate. And the ROI (return on investment) of your content.\n\nFrom an SEO perspective, this may improve your page views, decrease bounce rate, and send positive engagement signals to search engines.\n\nPro tip: Because readers may not read the entire page, you should include CTAs throughout your copy. But be sure to include them purposefully so your page isn't spammy. For example, if you mention a specific product, you can add a related CTA so the reader can learn more.\n\n10. Use a Table of Contents\n\nAdding a table of contents shows the reader exactly what they’ll find on a page.\n\nWhich helps satisfy search intent. \n\nMake sure the headings clearly describe what each section is about. That each section is thorough but not overwhelming.\n\nThink of your headings like a movie trailer.\n\nYou want to tell readers what your article is about. And keep them hooked to read along. \n\nAdding a table of contents helps readers confirm whether they’ve landed on a page that meets their needs.\n\nSo be sure to be specific and concise when adding headings to your table of contents.\n\nSEO Copywriting Tools \n\nWhen it comes to copywriting, SEO tools can help with all the above (and more). \n\nHere are a few Semrush tools you can use for your copywriting efforts.
