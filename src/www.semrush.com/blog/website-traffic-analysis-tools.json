To help you gain insights you can use to optimize your site's performance and improve the user experience (UX).\n\nWhy Is Website Traffic Analysis Important?\n\nPerforming a website traffic analysis lets you:\n\nIdentify which marketing campaigns are working by seeing which channels drive the most traffic\nIdentify low-engagement pages that need to be improved\nFind high-traffic pages you can further improve by optimizing the content\nUnderstand your different audience demographics to tailor content and marketing strategies effectively\nDetect technical issues that might be affecting your site's performance\n9 Top Website Traffic Analysis Tools\n\nNow that you know more about the benefits of this type of analysis, let’s get to the best tools for the job. \n\n1. Traffic Analytics\n\nTraffic Analytics provides estimates about any website’s traffic. And makes it easy to do a competitive analysis.\n\nIt provides a look at: \n\nHow many visitors a site is getting\nWhere they’re coming from\nHow many of them are new vs. returning\nWhat pages they’re landing on\n\nIt breaks down data by geographic location, channels, and device.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your domain, and select the location. Click \"Analyze.\"\n\nYou'll see seven different reports:\n\nOverview: A snapshot of the site’s traffic\nAudience Overview: Shows demographic information about visitors\nTraffic Journey: Identifies the main channels that drive traffic to the site\nTop Pages: Highlights the most popular pages on the site\nSubfolders: Analyzes traffic distribution within specific subfolders of the domain\nSubdomains: Details traffic metrics across different subdomains\nGeo Distribution: Offers a geographic breakdown\n\nFrom the “Overview” report, enter your competitors’ domains in the fields under the tabs. And click “Compare.”\n\nYou'll see metric comparisons. Which can reveal strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe Traffic Analytics tool offers detailed insights into how users engage with a website. While it can be useful for getting a snapshot of your own website’s performance, it’s especially useful for evaluating the competition.\n\nThe tool even provides a handy Audience Overview report. Which you can use to identify new segments you might want to reach.\n\nYou can even see how performance has changed over several years. Because you can access data from as far back as 2017.\n\nPricing\n\nYou can try Semrush for free. And there are three paid plans:\n\nPro: $139.95/month\nGuru: $249.95/month\nBusiness: $499.95/month\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Traffic\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Organic Traffic Insights\n\nOrganic Traffic Insights combines your Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Google Search Console (GSC), and Semrush data into one dashboard. Providing a comprehensive view of your website's traffic and organic search performance. \n\nThe tool details the specific search terms that lead visitors to your pages, the devices they use, and more. \n\nOpen the tool and set up a project. Follow the Organic Traffic Insights configuration guide for help with setting it up. \n\nOnce done, you'll see a report like this:\n\nClick on the hyperlinked number in the \"Semrush\" column under the \"Keywords\" section.\n\nYou'll then see all the keywords the corresponding page is ranking for. Along with metrics like ranking positions, search volume, keyword difficulty, and traffic share.\n\nTo see “not provided” keywords from GA4, click on the hyperlinked number in the \"GSC\" column in the \"Keywords\" section.\n\nYou’ll see a complete list of keywords driving traffic to the page in question—including the “not provided” keywords.\n\nGaining these insights helps you identify high-value keywords and keywords for which your rankings are declining. It also enables you to understand your organic growth more deeply.\n\nThis can help you refine your SEO strategy.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nOrganic Traffic Insights allows you to easily gauge your website’s performance from a single, easy-to-read dashboard.\n\nAnd it lets you cross-reference data from across multiple platforms.
