  "content": "What Is a SWOT Analysis? \n\nA SWOT analysis is a framework that evaluates a business’ strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The acronym \"SWOT\" stands for these four factors. Performing a SWOT analysis can help you make better business decisions.\n\nThe analysis typically involves creating a matrix with the four categories:\n\nWhat’s working for your business (strengths)\nWhat’s not working (weaknesses)\nThe external factors your business could capitalize on (opportunities)\nThe external factors that could harm your business (threats)\n\nIn this post, you’ll learn how to do a SWOT analysis. We’ll include examples and also give you a free SWOT analysis template.\n\nLet’s get to it.\n\nWhy Is a SWOT Analysis Important? \n\nA SWOT analysis is a valuable framework that can help you evaluate your business from different angles. And discover new ways to grow and improve.\n\nBy doing a SWOT analysis, you can:\n\nUse your strengths to stand out from your competitors\nAddress your weaknesses before they hurt you\nFind and seize new opportunities\nPrepare for and avoid potential threats\n\nWhich means:\n\nA SWOT analysis can help you make smarter decisions, plan better, and reach your goals faster.\n\nTip: Use Market Explorer to benchmark yourself against your competitors by comparing traffic acquisition, market share, and audience data.\n\nGain Insight Into Your Industry\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nWhat Are the Components of a SWOT Analysis?\n\nA SWOT analysis evaluates a business or project based on four key factors that can be divided into two categories: internal and external. \n\nHere’s how you might think about filling out a SWOT chart based on these two categories:\n\nLet’s take a look at each component.\n\nInternal Factors\n\nInternal factors are the aspects of your business within your control. They include resources, capabilities, skills, assets, and competitive advantages. \n\nAnd they can be divided further into two categories: strengths and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths\n\nStrengths are the positive attributes that give you an advantage over competitors. They’re the things that you do well, you’re proud of, and help you stand out.\n\nSome examples of strengths are:\n\nA loyal customer base\nA strong brand reputation\nA unique product or service\nA skilled and motivated team\nA high-quality website\nWeaknesses\n\nWeaknesses are your business’s negative attributes that limit your performance or hinder your growth. They’re the things you need to improve, fix, or avoid.\n\nSome examples of weaknesses are:\n\nA lack of financial resources\nA high turnover rate\nA weak online presence\nA low customer satisfaction rate\nA low-quality product or service\nExternal Factors\n\nExternal factors are the aspects of your business that are outside of your control. These can include trends, events, economic changes, and the competitive landscape. \n\nAnd they can also be divided into two categories: opportunities and threats.\n\nOpportunities\n\nOpportunities are favorable situations or conditions you can leverage to achieve your business goals. In other words, things you can use to your advantage or benefit from.\n\nSome SWOT analysis opportunities examples are:\n\nA growing demand for your product or service\nA new market segment or niche\nA new technology that automates routine tasks\nA new partnership or collaboration\nThreats\n\nThreats are unfavorable situations or conditions that can harm your business. They’re risks or challenges you need to recognize.\n\nSome examples of threats are:\n\nA declining demand for your product or service\nA new competitor or alternative\nA new technology that makes one of your services obsolete\nA negative publicity campaign\nA change in regulation or policy\n\nNow that you know about the different components, let’s take a look at exactly how to do a SWOT analysis. \n\nBenchmark Yourself Against Competitors\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nFree SWOT Analysis Template\n\nHere’s a SWOT analysis template you can use to follow along.\n\nWhy put your results into a SWOT analysis template like this one? \n\nBecause it’s easy to read and keeps things organized.\n\nHow to Do a SWOT Analysis (6 Simple Steps)\n\nA SWOT analysis is an assessment of your business’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\n\nBut it’s more than that. It’s also a tool to strategically advance your business.\n\nAnd that means going beyond a simple list of facts.\n\nHere’s how to do a SWOT analysis the right way:\n\n1. Establish Your Goal\n\nHaving a goal will help you choose what’s most relevant for your analysis. Otherwise, you might end up with a ton of basic information and no idea of how to apply it to your business.\n\nSo, set a goal.\n\nIt could be any major decision or change for your business:\n\nDecide whether you should expand your business\nAssess the feasibility of new products or services\nUnderstand the risks and benefits of changing HR processes\n\nWhat if you can’t think of a goal?\n\nHere’s a handy formula:\n\n(Fill in the blanks.) \n\nMy business needs __________. We might meet that need by doing these things:\n\n__________\n__________\n__________\n\nYou can pick more than one goal from that list. Or just the most important one. It’s up to you.\n\nLet’s look at an example:\n\nMy business needs more capital to continue operating. We might be able to meet that need by doing these things:\n\nRaising prices\nInvesting more in our sales team\nSeeking new investors\n\nLet’s say you choose the first item—raising prices. \n\nThe goal of your SWOT analysis could be something like this: \n\nTo find out whether raising prices will result in enough working capital for the business to continue operating.\n\nAgain, this is just one example. \n\nWhatever your goal is, keep it top of mind while you complete your SWOT analysis.\n\n2. Assess Strengths\n\nFor the next four steps, we’ll walk through how to do each part of the SWOT analysis itself.\n\nThe “S” in SWOT stands for strengths. In this step, you’ll list your business’s strengths.\n\nGet started by asking some questions:\n\nWhat should you include? \n\nAt this stage, every idea is a good one. So don’t leave anything out.\n\nWe’ll cover how to narrow down your list in the last step.\n\nRemember: \n\nStrengths are internal factors. That means you have control over them. And you can build on them.\n\nHere are some examples of strengths you might list in a SWOT analysis:\n\nMore organic web traffic than your competitors\nCutting-edge features or products that your competitors don’t have\nRecent investments or a large amount of working capital\n\nIf you need help thinking of strengths, use a competitive intelligence toolkit like Semrush .Trends. \n\nIt’ll help you see how you stack up against your competitors in terms of traffic, audience demographics, market share, and much more. \n\nFor example, you could use Traffic Analytics and see that organic traffic is way up compared to similar sites. \n\nOr that your bounce rate is way lower than others. Either way, it can reveal lots of things. \n\nJust enter up to five competitor domains and choose your market country or region. \n\nThen, compare the results to your own traffic data.\n\nAnalyze Any Company’s Online Performance\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Uncover Weaknesses\n\nYour business has weaknesses. And that’s OK—your goal is to make improvements.\n\nStart by writing down your weaknesses. Be honest with yourself. And be thorough.\n\nHere are some questions that can help:\n\nListing your weaknesses can be a bummer. But there’s good news:\n\nLike strengths, weaknesses are internal factors. That means you have control over them and can use them to improve.\n\nHere are some examples of weaknesses you might include in a SWOT analysis:\n\nHigh operating expenses relative to revenue\nLong customer support response times\nSEO content creation efforts failing to increase organic reach\n\nJust as Semrush’s .Trends can help you find strengths, it can also help find weaknesses. \n\nUse these tools wisely as you conduct your competitive SEO analysis. \n\n4. Consider Opportunities\n\nOpportunities are the “O” in SWOT. \n\nHere are some questions you can think through to uncover opportunities:\n\nIt’s easy to confuse “opportunities” with “strengths.” \n\nTo avoid that, keep this in mind:\n\nStrengths are internal factors. They exist inside your business. \n\nOpportunities are external factors. They happen outside of your business.\n\nYou build on strengths. You use opportunities to your advantage. \n\nIt’s a subtle but important distinction.\n\nHere are some examples of opportunities you might list in a SWOT analysis:\n\nMarket shifts increasing demand for a product your business could sell\nYour ideal customers flocking to a new social media platform you can use to reach them\nA competitor ceasing operations in a region where you don’t currently operate\n\nTip: A great way to find opportunities is to use the Keyword Gap tool. It’ll help find keywords your competitors are ranking for, but you aren’t. Each of those keywords is an opportunity for you to bring in more traffic. \n\nFind Keyword Opportunities\n\nwith the Keyword Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Identify Threats\n\nThreats are the “T” in SWOT. And they’re the opposite of opportunities.\n\nThey’re external factors that could put your business at risk.\n\nHere are some questions that will help you identify threats:\n\nThreats evolve over time based on factors outside of your control. But you can plan for them.\n\nIf you’re paying close attention to your industry, you probably know the major threats you face. Write them down in your template. \n\nHere are some examples of threats you might list in a SWOT analysis:\n\nAn emerging competitor\nA legal change that could affect your business \nEconomic conditions that negatively impact your customers’ buying power\n\nYou can use Market Explorer in the .Trends toolkit to spot emerging competitors and trends.\n\nEnter your domain to find competitors in your market.\n\nThen scroll down to the growth quadrant to see which domains are rising in your industry. You can view competitors by behavior, traffic, and growth metrics. \n\nLearn About Emerging Competitors\n\nwith the Market Explorer Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n6. Narrow Your Lists\n\nAt this point, you should have a decent number of items in each of your four SWOT categories. Now, you have to narrow them down.\n\nThere’s no set maximum number of items for each category. But keep this in mind:\n\nYou don’t want to overwhelm yourself.\n\nStick to the most important items. Stay focused so you can make impactful changes. \n\nStruggling to narrow your lists? Try the impact effort matrix. \n\nIt’s a tool to help you decide which actions could have the greatest impact with the least effort.\n\nAnd it looks like this:\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nCompile all of the items from your SWOT analysis\nDraw a four-quadrant diagram. On the vertical axis, you’re measuring the impact of an item on your business. On the horizontal axis, you’re measuring the effort required to implement or address that item.\nPlace each strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat into its appropriate quadrant based on required effort and potential impact\nThe items in the top left quadrant are likely to be your best options. Because they’ll have the most impact for the least effort.\nWhen Should You Do a SWOT Analysis?\n\nThere’s rarely a wrong time to do a SWOT analysis.\n\nBottom line: \n\nIf you’re looking for clarity on a business move you’re considering, that’s a great time to do one.\n\nHere are some other perfect times to do a SWOT analysis:\n\nWhen your business is undergoing significant internal changes\nWhen external conditions are changing\nBefore strategic planning\nOn a regular basis\n3 Real-World SWOT Examples\n\nNow that we've covered how to perform a SWOT analysis, let's put those steps to the test with some examples.\n\n1. Marketing Agency SWOT Analysis Example\n\nImagine you’re running a marketing agency that does SEO, social media, and content marketing. \n\nYou’re thinking about investing a lot of time and resources into your website’s blog. You know that great, search engine-optimized blog content could earn you more inbound leads over time. \n\nBut you’re not sure whether it’s the right move.\n\nSo, you do a SWOT analysis to help you decide. The goal is to answer this question:\n\nShould we invest more time and resources into our website content to increase our inbound leads?\n\nStart with your strengths. Here are the fictional marketing agency’s strengths:\n\nYour all-remote team saves money on office space and enables you to hire the best talent, regardless of their geographic location\nMany members of your existing team have content creation skills\nYou consistently outperform your competition by getting better SEO results for your clients\n\nAdd your weaknesses:\n\nYour team struggles to get deliverables to clients on time each month\nYou have published very little on your blog in the past, so your current search engine rankings are minimal to nonexistent\nYour team has no codified processes for content creation, such as style guides or publishing standard operating procedures (SOPs)\n\nNext up is opportunities:\n\nFew of your local competitors have invested heavily in their own blog content\nPeople enter keywords related to your services into Google many times per month\nRecent market research suggests that your ideal clients are more likely to trust agencies with active blogs\n\nFinally, list the threats your agency faces:\n\nSearch engines are becoming more selective about what they will display in search results, leaning more heavily on long-established blogs\nThe economy is showing early signs of a downturn that could reduce investment in marketing, meaning your investment in content is less likely to yield ROI\nNew agencies with strong content and SEO strategies are popping up in droves as more people leave their jobs to start their own businesses\n\nStrengths\n\n\t\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\n\nRemote team saves money and attracts talent\nEmployees have content creation experience\nClients get great SEO results\n\t\nTeam struggles to deliver on time as it is\nCurrent search rankings are nonexistent\nNo SOPs for content creation\n\n\n\nOpportunities\n\n\t\n\nThreats\n\n\n\nLocal competitors haven’t invested in their own content\nStrong search demand related to your services\nIdeal clients more likely to trust agencies with active blogs\n\t\nSearch engines are becoming more selective\nAn economic downturn may be on the horizon\nNew agencies with strong SEO strategies are entering the market\n\nThat’s it. Of course, now you actually have to do something with this information.\n\nMore specifically:\n\nYou need to see how your website content is actually performing.\n\nYou can use Google Search Console to measure that.\n\nGo to “Search results” and check the box for “Average position.”\n\nScroll down to see your organic keyword rankings or positions:\n\nThese tell you where the website currently stands in Google search results for particular keywords.\n\nIn our fictional agency SWOT analysis example, your baseline organic keyword rankings would give you an idea of your starting point.\n\nAnd in Semrush’s Domain Overview tool, you can find organic competitors. This tells you about the competition you’d face if you invested more in your website content. \n\nScroll down until you see your top organic keywords:\n\nThere’s also a competitive positioning map. Which puts your website’s search engine performance in visual context with your competitors:\n\nCheck Any Competitor’s Site Performance\n\nwith the Domain Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Local Service Business SWOT Analysis Example\n\nNow, let’s look at an example SWOT analysis for a local service business. \n\nOur example will be about a criminal defense law firm. But many of the principles we’ll explore could apply to other local services businesses:\n\nHVAC contractors\nPlumbers\nElectricians\nHome remodelers\nAccountants\nFlorists\nCaterers\n\nLet’s dive in:\n\nYour fictional criminal defense law firm operates primarily in the Manhattan area of New York City. You focus on white collar criminal defense but offer other types of criminal defense. \n\nYou’re considering an expansion. You want to open a new office on Long Island, New York, and offer your services there.\n\nBut you’re not sure whether the expansion will be profitable. To find out, you do a SWOT analysis:\n\nIt’s always the same process. Begin with strengths:\n\nYou get many Manhattan clients through referrals from past clients and word of mouth\nYou have a highly successful track record with your clients\nYou have room in the budget to hire new attorneys and open a second office\n\nTime for your firm’s weaknesses:\n\nYour team is inexperienced with cases outside of white collar crimes\nYour attorneys are familiar with New York City courthouses and judges, but they’re not experienced with those on Long Island\nYour firm’s digital marketing and advertising efforts have been largely ineffective\n\nOn to opportunities:\n\nFew Long Island law firms offer white collar criminal defense (your area of specialty)\nEconomic development and business expansion on Long Island may increase the local need for white collar criminal defense services\nStatewide law enforcement crackdowns may increase demand for criminal defense across the state of New York\n\nFinish it off with the threats your firm faces:\n\nYour competitors are also considering expanding to Long Island\nReal estate taxes are rising rapidly on Long Island with no signs of slowing down\nCompeting law firms have hundreds of positive online reviews\n\nStrengths\n\n\t\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\n\nClients come to you through referrals and your reputation\nYou have demonstrated success\nYou have the money to expand\n\t\nYou’re not familiar with all types of criminal defense work\nYour attorneys don’t know the Long Island legal market well\nYou’ve struggled to raise awareness of your firm through marketing and advertising\n\n\n\nOpportunities\n\n\t\n\nThreats\n\n\n\nLong Island may have unmet demand for your area of specialty\nMore business activity in the area may increase demand for white collar criminal defense\nIncreased law enforcement activity may increase the need for criminal defense services\n\t\nCompetitors may also enter the Long Island market\nReal estate taxes are rising rapidly on Long Island\nCompetitors have a much stronger digital presence than your firm\n\nWith the SWOT analysis complete, it’s time to take action. To further explore your local market, you could use Market Explorer. \n\nThis tool offers a Benchmarking report that shows side-by-side comparisons of main players in your local market. \n\nGo into the tool and click “Find Competitors.”\n\nThen, under “Location,” select your country or region. Enter your domain. And click “Research a market.”\n\nLike this:\n\nYou get a detailed market summary:\n\nHere, you’ll find out:\n\nWho the key players in your market are\nHow much business consolidation has occurred in your market\nHow much total traffic is available in your market\nTotal addressable market (TAM) and serviceable available market (SAM)\n\nYou’ll also get a look at a Growth Quadrant for your market.\n\nThe Growth Quadrant shows where your business’s website falls among your competitors. \n\nAre you a leader, established player, niche player, or game changer? And where are your competitors on that scale?\n\nThe Growth Quadrant places your website and your competitors within one of those quadrants. \n\nThat helps you identify your own positioning and where you could go. \n\nGoing back to our law firm thinking about expanding: \n\nThe Growth Quadrant could help them understand who the established players are on Long Island. And whether there’s room to break into the market.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nSmall Business SEO\n3. Ecommerce SWOT Analysis Example\n\nFor this next example, let’s imagine you run an ecommerce business. One of your competitors has just offered to buy your brand.\n\nYou’re not sure whether you should sell your business or keep it. So, you do a SWOT analysis to get a clearer picture.\n\nYou list your strengths:\n\nYour business is consistently profitable\nYour website is ranking well in Google search results for some extremely valuable keywords related to your products\nYou have automated many of your internal processes to reduce labor expenses\n\nNext, you list your weaknesses:\n\nYou have poor customer support operations, which has led to some negative online reviews\nFew of your products generate a very high profit margin, so you have to sell at high volumes consistently\nYou rarely have repeat customers, meaning you have to spend more on marketing and advertising to acquire new customers\n\nOpportunities are up next:\n\nOne of your key competitors recently decided to dissolve their business. That leaves a gap in the market.\nOne of your products was recently featured in a popular TV show. That could drive up demand.\nYou’ve started to receive queries about influencer partnerships and affiliate marketing opportunities\n\nLast but not least, threats:\n\nYour products are not environmentally friendly. Growing environmental awareness could lead to lower public opinion of your products. \nMuch of your ability to sell your products rests with third parties like Amazon and Shopify. A single change in those third-party platforms could severely harm sales.\nPolitical unrest is making it difficult to ship your products to one of your key buyer markets\n\nStrengths\n\n\t\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\n\nYour business is profitable\nYour SEO efforts are driving sales\nYou have automated processes to cut expenses\n\t\nYour customer support is lacking\nSlim profit margins mean you have to sell a lot\nYou have high customer acquisition costs because you don’t retain many customers\n\n\n\nOpportunities\n\n\t\n\nThreats\n\n\n\nA key competitor left the market\nA TV appearance may drive demand for your product\nAffiliate and influencer marketing opportunities could drive more sales\n\t\nEnvironmental sentiment could reduce the popularity of your products\nThird-party selling platforms could change their rules and wreck your current sales processes\nShipping is becoming unreliable in one of your key markets\n\nRemember: Your next step after actually writing the analysis is to do something.\n\nIn this case, you need to make a decision. \n\nIf you’ve done your SWOT analysis right, you should have the information you need to make that decision.\n\nAnalyze Your Business & Achieve Your Goals\n\nSetting and achieving goals is key to business success.
