  "content": "What Are Seed Keywords?\n\nA seed keyword is a keyword without any modifiers, also known as a short-tail keyword.\n\nIt’s typically made up of one or two words and has a high monthly search volume. And lots of competition.\n\nThink of seed keywords as the pillars of a website optimization strategy. They cover your site’s most important topics and are the starting point for keyword research that will shape your SEO strategy.\n\nYou modify seed keywords with more words. This creates either a medium-tail or long-tail keyword with the seed keyword at the root. Identifying those is the basis of keyword research.\n\nThe modifiers you add to a seed keyword usually clarify the seed keyword or describe it more fully, like with a niche or a location. \n\nFor example, the keyword “marketing” could become “product marketing” or “marketing strategy” with the addition of modifiers.\n\nHere are some more examples:\n\nSeed Keyword\n\n\t\n\nMedium-Tail Keyword Example\n\n\t\n\nLong-Tail Keyword Example\n\n\n\n\nArt ideas\n\n\t\n\nPixel art ideas\n\n\t\n\nHow to make pixel art\n\n\n\n\nLean manufacturing\n\n\t\n\n5s lean manufacturing\n\n\t\n\nLean manufacturing vs. six sigma\n\n\n\n\nLaptop review\n\n\t\n\nLaptop reviews 2024\n\n\t\n\nDell G15 gaming laptop review\n\nBasically, seed keywords spawn all of your other keywords. Which is the main reason it’s so important to get them right.\n\nWhy Are Seed Keywords Important for Keyword Research?\n\nSeed keywords are important for keyword research because they’re the basis for medium- and long-tail keywords. \n\nLong-tail keywords are used to optimize subpages. Those subpages are linked internally to other pages like pillar pages, the homepage, or product pages. And help them rank for seed keywords. \n\nGet the seed keyword wrong—get the whole site structure wrong. Then, end up with irrelevant traffic.\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder can help you analyze seed keywords and identify opportunities to create relevant content—including pillar pages, cluster pages, and more.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nOpen the tool and type up to five seed keywords into the box. Here, we’ll use variations of “tennis racket” as our seed keywords. Then, click \"Create List.\"\n\nThe tool will generate a comprehensive list of potential keywords related to your seed terms. We got 833 potential keywords organized into 47 clusters. A cluster is a group of similar keywords based on search intent. \n\nUse these insights to find promising keyword clusters and strategically plan your content creation efforts. Whether you're developing pillar pages to establish authority on broad topics or crafting pages to target specific long-tail keywords.\n\nAnalyze Seed Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Strategy Builder Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Find Seed Keywords\n\nFind seed keywords through five different methods—brainstorming, analyzing search engine results pages (SERPs), examining your website traffic, monitoring your competitors' website traffic, and searching online forums.\n\nEach of these sources can be a goldmine of potential seed keywords. If you know where to look.\n\nStart with Brainstorming\n\nYou might already have some ideas for seed keywords. Those ideas are some of the best places to start.\n\nConsider your products. Your customers. Your competitors. What main language do they use to describe themselves? What terms come to mind easily?\n\nFor example, say you sell shampoo. Your brainstormed list of seed keywords might look like this:\n\nShampoo\nConditioner\nHair products\nHair washing\n\nAnalyze these seed keywords by running them through the Keyword Magic Tool. Launch the tool and type one of your example keywords into the search bar. Then, click \"Search.\"\n\nIt’ll automatically generate a list of keywords that are a “Broad Match” for your seed keyword. Those are potential long-tail keywords. They should give you an idea of whether or not you’re on the right track. \n\nYou’re looking for seed keywords that generate lots of relevant long-tail keywords. You want them to be able to drive a meaningful amount of potential traffic to your site.\n\nOur search found several long-tail keywords related to hair washing tips. These are very relevant queries for a shampoo company.\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool also helps you find additional seed keywords. Toggle to “Related” in the filters beneath the search bar. This will show you other keywords related to your seed keyword. Some of which may be seed keywords themselves.\n\nFor instance, our related keyword list for “hair washing” included terms like “hair tips” and “healthy hair,” two potential seed keyword candidates.\n\nFind Long-Tail Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nCheck Out Google’s SERPs\n\nLearn how to find seed keywords by analyzing the SERPs. Type one of your brainstormed seed keywords into the search bar. Google will give you new ideas before you even search.\n\nWhen we type “content marketing,” Google suggests other terms for us to search. \n\nThis suggested list includes other potential seed keywords, like “digital marketing,” “social media marketing,” and “email marketing.”\n\nThere are more ideas in the SERP once you click search.\n\nIn the featured snippet for “content marketing,” we see other terms like “marketing strategy, “audience,” “brand awareness,” and more. Each of these is a potential seed keyword.\n\nFind more seed keywords in the “People also ask” box lower down the SERP. Click to expand the questions to see more questions and more potential seed keywords.\n\nHere, we see potential keywords like “content strategy,” “buyer persona,” and “distribution plan.”\n\nThe SERP also has a “People also search for” module. It can contain several other potential seed keyword ideas.\n\nSometimes, a SERP will also have a video module. Those video results will list key moments, which can also hide potential seed keywords. Like “social media marketing” in this case.\n\nIf you’re unsure whether something is a good seed keyword, use Keyword Overview. \n\nOpen the tool and type in your potential keyword. Click \"Search.\"\n\nYou’ll be shown a quick overview of the keyword’s difficulty (KD%) and search volume. \n\nYou want to choose seed keywords that have the potential to drive a meaningful amount of traffic to your website. And give you thousands of potential long-tail keywords to work with.\n\nIn this case, \"social media marketing\" could be a good seed keyword.\n\nUnder “Keyword ideas” further down the page, there are variations of the term. The listed questions can also help you determine whether a seed keyword is relevant.\n\nYou don’t need ideas to find seed keywords, though. Start with the keywords you already rank for.\n\nCheck Keyword Metrics\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUse Google Search Console\n\nIf you already have a website, connect to Google Search Console (GSC). We’ll walk through how to identify seed keywords with this useful tool.\n\nGSC will show you the search results for which you already rank. \n\nOpen the tool and click “Search Results” in the left-hand navigation. You’ll see a graph showing clicks and impressions over time. Scroll down to see the full list of keywords.\n\nYou’ll find a full list of keywords under a tab labeled “QUERIES.” You can organize them by impressions or clicks. Organizing by impressions will show you the keywords for which you rank highly and have a lot of search volume.\n\nIn this example, we see relevant keywords like “content marketing app” and “headspace marketing.” These might make good potential seed keywords.\n\nTake these keywords back to the Keyword Magic Tool to confirm. We searched “app content strategy.” \n\nBased on the potential long-tail keywords, it could be valuable to our seed keyword strategy. \n\nEven with low search volume, it might make sense to create content with the goal of ranking for this keyword. Terms that have a low volume but are hyper-relevant to your business could be worth it because they’re more likely to convert.\n\nForums and Online Communities\n\nYou can also get seed keywords directly from consumer feedback. Do this by researching how they ask questions on forums and online communities.\n\nLet’s say you run a website that provides interior design advice. A quick search on Reddit for “interior design” turns up a list of relevant subreddits.\n\nWe found many customers asking questions about interior design on r/InteriorDesignAdvice. The example post below contains several potential seed keywords, like “room layout” and “furniture layout”:\n\nA search on Google for “interior design forum” turned up Houzz, a place where customers can ask interior design questions to professionals.\n\nJust scanning the titles of posts reveals several potential seed keywords. Like “fireplace,” “wallpaper,” and “room makeover.”\n\nThe last stop for potential keywords takes you beyond yourself and your customers—to your competition.\n\nAnalyze Your Competition\n\nAnother way to find seed keywords is a competitor analysis. Analyze competitors' websites to see what seed keywords send them traffic.\n\nLet’s say you want to teach basketball lessons in Westfield, New Jersey. \n\nYou’ll be up against websites like the local YMCA, coaching marketplaces, and other local competitors.\n\nYou’ll need an SEO tool like Organic Research to analyze their domains.\n\nOpen the tool, then copy and paste your competitor's domain into the search bar. Next, click “Search.”\n\nIn this case, we’ll analyze the local YMCA site in Westfield, NJ.\n\nYou’ll see an overview of the domain. It includes the number of keywords the site ranks for.\n\nScroll down to “Top Keywords” to see their best performers. We can see that “westfield youth sports” is relevant to our strategy and could serve as a good keyword. \n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Keywords\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nGenerate Thousands of Keyword Ideas with Semrush\n\nThe whole point of tracking down seed keywords is to use them for keyword research.
