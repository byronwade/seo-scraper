  "content": "What Is Negative SEO?\n\nNegative SEO (sometimes known as adverse SEO) is a malicious attempt to harm a business’s visibility in search engine results, typically with the aim of stealing its keyword rankings and traffic.\n\nThe idea is to make the target website look like it’s using SEO spam tactics that violate search engine policies. And therefore trigger the search engine into suppressing its results.\n\nOr make the business look bad to human users. So they don’t click through.\n\nNegative SEO is unethical and can be illegal in certain cases.\n\nIt also tends to be ineffective. Because search engines are getting better at spotting—and ignoring—negative SEO attacks. \n\nFor years, Google spokespeople have advised webmasters to ignore threats and attacks. And instead focus on making their site better.\n\nSo, if you notice a decline in keyword rankings or organic traffic, it’s unlikely that negative SEO is to blame. \n\nThat said, many marketers believe attacks can harm a business’s rankings and reputation. So you should be aware of the different types and how to deal with them.\n\n7 Types of Negative SEO Attacks\n\nBelow are some of the most common types of negative SEO attacks. \n\nWe’ll explain how to identify, address, and prevent these attacks.\n\n1. Hacking\n\nHackers can gain unauthorized access to a website and harm its SEO in a variety of ways.\n\nFor example, they might:\n\nDelete or deface your content\nRedirect your URLs to spammy pages\nInject malicious code that harms your users\n\nThis type of negative SEO isn’t always obvious. \n\nTo protect your site, you should:\n\nRegularly scan your website with security software\nEnable security alerts in Google Search Console\nInvestigate any sudden declines in your SEO results\n\nWith Semrush’s Position Tracking tool, you can get alerts when rankings drop.\n\nAfter setting up the tool, click the bell icon at the top.\n\nThen, create a trigger like this:\n\nJust remember that drops are rarely due to negative SEO attacks. There are many other things that can hurt your rankings.\n\nTrack Your Rankings with Ease\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Link Removals\n\nCertain kinds of backlinks (links from other sites) can benefit your SEO. So unscrupulous competitors might try to remove them.\n\nHow?\n\nBy contacting the referring site and asking them to remove the link. While pretending to act on your business’s behalf.\n\nTo monitor lost backlinks, use Semrush’s Backlink Audit tool.\n\nAfter setting it up, go to the “Lost & Found” report.\n\nScroll down and click “Lost” to see backlinks you’ve lost in the past three months.\n\nIf you lose a potentially valuable backlink (due to a negative SEO attack or other reason), consider reaching out to the site. And kindly asking them to reinstate it.\n\nTo ensure you don’t miss lost backlinks in the future, set up automatic recrawls.\n\nClick the cog icon and open the “Recrawl schedule.”\n\nDecide whether you want to check your backlinks every week, two weeks, or month. \n\nThen, check the box to enable email alerts. And exit to save your settings.\n\n3. Malicious Link Building\n\nMalicious link building is the process of building spammy links to a target site, with the goal of making search engines penalize the target site.\n\nFor example, Google’s link spam policies state that websites should not build keyword-rich links across various sites.\n\nSo an unscrupulous marketer might use negative SEO services to do exactly that. Making sure all the links point to a competitor’s domain.\n\nTo see if you’re a victim, use Semrush’s Backlink Audit tool.\n\nThe tool finds backlinks to your site. Then analyzes 45+ markers to assign each one a Toxicity Score (TS) out of 100.\n\nGo to the “Audit” tab to see all your suspicious links.\n\nAnalyze each backlink to determine whether it’s harmful.\n\nThen, send it to one of three lists (using the corresponding icon):\n\nWhitelist: This is where you move backlinks that you’ve deemed safe\nRemoval list: From here, you can contact the referring site and ask them to remove the link\nDisavow list: From here, you can create a disavow file that asks Google to ignore the link\n\nIt’s important to note that disavowing links can do more harm than good.\n\nGoogle’s John Mueller claims that malicious links should not harm the target site’s SEO. And should simply be ignored.\n\nAudit Your Backlink Profile’\n\nwith the Backlink Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Content Scraping\n\nContent scraping is the process of copying content from a target site and publishing it elsewhere without permission.\n\nWhen Google encounters duplicate content, it will usually pick just one version to display. Because it doesn’t want to deliver near-identical results to its users.\n\nAnd it might show the plagiarized version, rather than the original. Meaning that the target site suffers from organic traffic losses.\n\nTo see if your content’s been scraped, consider a service like Copysentry. It automatically monitors the web for copies of your pages. And alerts you of any hits.\n\nIf your content is plagiarized, contact the webmaster and ask them to remove the content. \n\nIf unsuccessful, you can report the issue to Google, submit a DMCA notice, or take legal action. Consult a qualified legal professional about your legal options before taking legal action.\n\nFurther reading: SEO Plagiarism: How to Find and Prevent Copycat Content\n\n5. Smear Campaigns\n\nA smear campaign is an effort to spread false and damaging information about a person or business.\n\nFor example, the perpetrator might:\n\nWrite a defamatory blog post\nCreate fake social profiles for impersonation purposes\nSpread rumors via online communities like Reddit\nSubmit baseless DMCA notices (copyright infringement complaints)\nShare false information with influencers in your niche\n\nThese activities can harm your business’s reputation. Potentially meaning that Google’s less likely to rank you highly—and users are less likely to click your results.\n\nTo protect your business, respond appropriately to any formal complaints you receive. And keep an eye on your brand mentions (online references to your brand name).\n\nThe Brand Monitoring app makes it easy.\n\nJust enter the name of the brand you want to track.\n\nThen, go to the “Email notifications” tab and click “Set up email notifications.”\n\nWe recommend setting up a “Negative sentiment alert.” So you’re immediately notified when someone says something bad about your brand.\n\nBut you might want alerts for other mentions, too.\n\nTo view all your mentions in one place, head to the “Mentions” tab.\n\nJust remember: \n\nNot all negative mentions result from negative SEO attacks. So you need to choose your course of action carefully.\n\nFor example, if you’re dealing with a genuine disgruntled customer, you might need to contact them and offer a friendly resolution. \n\nBut if you’re dealing with a malicious attack, you might need to consider more serious action.\n\nFurther reading: A Beginner’s Guide to Online Reputation Management\n\n6. Review Bombing\n\nReview bombing is the act of posting high volumes of fake, negative reviews for a business.\n\nBad ratings can appear in Google results. And discourage users from clicking through.\n\nPlus, Google ratings play an important role in local SEO. The top-ranking map results tend to have high average scores.\n\nGoogle uses automated spam detection in an attempt to remove fake reviews. But it’s a good idea to monitor reviews manually. So you can take immediate action if anything’s missed.\n\nTo check your Google reviews more easily, use Semrush’s Review Management tool.\n\nMonitor key metrics at the top of the report.\n\nAnd scroll down to see individual reviews.\n\nIf you receive a fake review (or any other review that violates Google policies), you can request its removal via Google Business Profile.\n\nOther review platforms should have a reporting feature, too.\n\nMonitor Your Google Reviews\n\nwith the Review Management Tool\n\nTry it Now →\n7. Unauthorized Hotlinking\n\nHotlinking allows webmasters to load media (e.g., images) directly from another site rather than hosting it on their own site’s server.\n\nExcessive and unauthorized hotlinking is used as a negative SEO attack. Because it puts strain on the host site’s servers, which can slow the site’s speed. And ultimately lead to lower rankings.\n\nThis is a type of attack called “bandwidth theft.”\n\nThere are a couple of ways you can prevent hotlinking before it even happens, like:\n\nUsing a plugin like All-In-One-Security for WordPress sites\nAdding the following code to your .htaccess file (change “samplesite.com” to your website URL)\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https://(www\\.)?samplesite.com/.*$ [NC]\nRewriteRule \\.(gif|jpg|jpeg|mp3|png|pdf|zip)$ - [F]\n\nAlso prevent bandwidth theft by keeping an eye on your page speed metrics with Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nSchedule regular crawls so you can quickly identify, diagnose, and address any speed issues. (And any other technical issues on your site.)\n\nProtect Your Business with Semrush\n\nSemrush tools can help you identify and combat negative SEO attacks.\n\nGet ranking alerts with Position Tracking\nCheck backlinks with Backlink Audit\nMonitor reviews with Review Management\nAnalyze brand mentions with Brand Monitoring\nTrack site speed with Site Audit\n\nBut they can also help you build strong rankings—and a good reputation.
