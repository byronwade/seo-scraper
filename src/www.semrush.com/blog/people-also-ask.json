  "content": "What Is People Also Ask?\n\nPeople Also Ask (PAA) is a Google Search feature that shows questions related to the user’s initial search query. And often appears near the top of search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nThis feature helps users find more information about their topic without having to perform extra searches. \n\nClicking a PAA question opens it to show a short answer. And for each answer in People Also Ask, Google has sourced the information from a specific webpage you can visit for more information.\n\nSometimes, you might see a simple paragraph. But the answer could also include a bulleted list, a table, an image, or even a video. \n\nWhy Is Google’s People Also Ask Important?\n\nPeople Also Ask is a type of SERP feature (a unique result that stands out from standard listings) that helps users explore topics more deeply without needing to refine their search queries. So users can find what they need more efficiently.\n\nThis presents an opportunity for website owners and SEOs. Because if your website appears in both regular search results and PAA boxes, you can gain more visibility. Which can translate to more revenue.\n\nThis is especially true when you consider that People Also Ask boxes appear in 51.85% of all searches, according to Semrush Sensor data from August 2024.\n\nPAA boxes are also useful for finding new keywords to target in your content. To help you attract more visitors who are looking for specific information.\n\nHow to Find People Also Ask Questions\n\nThere are several methods to discover PAA questions related to topics you’ve covered or plan to cover: \n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool is a powerful resource for uncovering PAA questions related to terms you don’t yet have content for.\n\nTo get started, enter a broad keyword related to your brand along with your domain name. And click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will generate a list of related keywords. And display a Personal Keyword Difficulty (PKD %) score for each, which indicates how difficult it will be for your specific domain to rank for those terms.\n\nClick the “Advanced filters” drop-down, select the “Any” drop-down under “SERP Features,” and check the box next to “People also ask.”\n\nThen, click “Apply.”\n\nYou’ll now see only terms that trigger PAA boxes. \n\nChoose a primary keyword (the main keyword your content will focus on) by considering how many monthly searches it gets and how likely you are to rank for it.\n\nTo see People Also Ask questions for your selected keyword, click the icon to the left of the “SF” column. \n\nIn the SERP preview that appears, analyze the People Also Ask section to see the questions that appear.\n\nYou can then incorporate those questions and their answers within your content. We’ll go over how to do that later in this article.\n\nFind PAA Questions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUse Semrush’s Organic Research Tool\n\nThe Organic Research tool lets you see keywords you already rank for in search results but not in PAA sections. And those are valuable opportunities to expand your visibility.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your domain name, and click “Search.”\n\nThen, go to the “Positions” tab.\n\nClick the “SERP Features” drop-down, choose “Domain doesn’t rank,” and select “People also ask.”\n\nThis will show you keywords where you rank in regular search results but not in PAA boxes.\n\nFor each of these keywords, check the current PAA questions that appear in search results. \n\nSee whether your content already includes and answers these questions. If not, you’ll want to update your content.\n\nUncover PAA Opportunities\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUse Google Search\n\nAnother effective method to discover PAA questions is by simply using Google Search.\n\nJust enter your topic in the search bar and hit search. \n\nOn the results page, look for the People Also Ask box with a few questions.\n\nTip\n\nIf the term you searched doesn’t trigger a PAA section, try a variation.\n\nClick on one of these questions, and you’ll see additional related questions.\n\nYou can continue clicking on questions to reveal even more related queries.\n\nUse AlsoAsked\n\nAlsoAsked is a keyword tool that’s specially designed for finding People Also Ask questions. \n\nEnter your topic into the search bar and click “Search.” \n\nThe tool will generate a visual map of related questions that people are asking about your topic. \n\nEach node on the map represents a question, and you can click on any node to expand it further. To reveal additional questions that are associated with the original query.\n\nHow to Optimize Your Content for People Also Ask Boxes\n\nNow that we’ve explored how to find People Also Ask questions, let's dive into how to use these questions effectively in your content. So you can increase your visibility in search results.\n\nNote\n\nAll basic SEO best practices apply here as well—writing compelling title tags, incorporating internal links, etc. So be sure you're following those before you get too concerned about incorporating PAA questions.\n\n1. Include PAA Questions as Headings and Subheadings\n\nHeadings and subheadings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) convey to Google what topics your content covers.\n\nWhen you incorporate PAA questions as subheadings, it’s a clear signal to Google that your content is relevant to those queries. Which improves the chances of your content being featured in PAA boxes. \n\n2. Answer the Questions Directly\n\nTry to answer the questions as directly as possible to make it easier for Google to match your content to the question. And increase the likelihood of your content being selected as an answer.\n\nFor example, the American Osteopathic Association answers the PAA question \"What are the benefits of yoga?\" with a clear list of benefits. \n\n3. Align with the Existing Format \n\nPAA answers can appear in various formats, such as paragraphs, bulleted lists, and numbered lists. So, it’s a good idea to analyze the format of the current answers.\n\nFor instance, this answer is presented as a short paragraph.\n\nThat means you should aim to replicate that style in your content. To improve your chances of being featured in the PAA box.\n\n4. Optimize Your Images\n\nSometimes, PAA answers include images. And optimizing your images increases the chances they'll be featured.\n\nHere are two best practices for optimizing images:\n\nUse descriptive alt text. Ensure each image has alt text that accurately describes what the image is. This helps Google understand the context of the image.\nChoose informative file names. Use descriptive file names such as \"benefits-of-yoga.jpg\" (rather than generic ones like \"IMG1234.jpg\") to indicate what the image's content is.\nGrow Your Visibility Through PAA Boxes\n\nAppearing in People Also Ask sections helps you reach more people than you otherwise would. Which translates to more traffic and possibly more revenue.\n\nThe first step is to determine which PAA questions to include in your content. Which you can do with the Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nTry it today.\n\nFind PAA Questions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
