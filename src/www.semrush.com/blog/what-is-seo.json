  "content": "What Is SEO?\n\nSEO (search engine optimization) is an effort to make your website more visible in search engines like Google—without paying for ads. \n\nIt’s sometimes called SEO marketing, SEO optimization, or organic search marketing. And it can help you earn organic (unpaid) rankings like this:\n\nAnd get more brand awareness and traffic as a result.\n\nBasically, SEO involves making your site more appealing to users and search engines.\n\nThere are four main elements in any well-rounded SEO strategy:\n\nKeyword research: Finding out what your target audience searches for\nOn-page SEO: Optimizing webpages and their content\nOff-page SEO: Getting other sites to link to your site—which can boost its reputation\nTechnical SEO: Improving your site’s overall performance and accessibility\n\nYou’ll learn more about these later.\n\nNote\n\nThe term “SEO” can also reference a person. Someone who can be called a “search engine optimization expert” or similar.\n\nSearch Engine Marketing vs. Search Engine Optimization\n\nSearch engine marketing (SEM) is the process of promoting a business through unpaid or paid results on search engines—often both.\n\nSEO is the subset of SEM that focuses on organic results. It can generate traffic that you don’t have to pay the search engine for.\nPay-per-click (PPC) marketing is the subset of SEM that focuses on sponsored (paid) results. It involves setting up ad campaigns and paying to run them and generate traffic.\n\nPaid results don’t always appear on search engine results pages (SERPs). But when they do, they tend to appear at the top. With some kind of “Sponsored” or “Ad” label.\n\nLike this:\n\nPPC can give you immediate visibility for high-value keywords. Whereas SEO can take weeks or months to show results. \n\nBut organic results tend to have higher click-through rates. Because users often trust them more than they do ads. And organic results can generate sustained traffic at little to no ongoing cost.\n\nTip\n\nCheck out our dedicated guide to learn more about SEO vs. PPC.\n\nWhy Is SEO Important?\n\nIn digital marketing, SEO is important because it helps you capitalize on the organic brand awareness and traffic that search engines generate.\n\nFor example, REI’s SEO strategy yields around 7.4M monthly visitors. According to Semrush’s Organic Research tool:\n\nIf you don’t use SEO, you’re unlikely to rank prominently for relevant terms. Which limits your ability to reach new prospects and persuade them to convert.\n\nUsers will probably go to a competitor instead.\n\nAfter all, a higher ranking typically translates into more impressions and a better click-through rate.\n\nAnd since website SEO improves the experience for users, it can also lead to better engagement and conversion rates. Plus increased traffic from other sources—not just search engines.\n\nUltimately, SEO can deliver a good return on investment.\n\nTry Semrush’s SEO Tools\n\nwith Your Free Account\n\nSign Up Now →\nHow Does SEO Work?\n\nSEO works by aligning your website with how search engines define good search results.\n\nBasically, search engines use complex processes and criteria to rank search results. With the aim of giving users the best search experience.\n\nWorking on your website and content with these systems in mind can help you gain more visibility.\n\nThat said, SEO is not a perfect science.\n\nSearch engines are somewhat secretive about the systems they use. And constantly change them to further improve search results.\n\nSo, testing, analysis, and adaptation are crucial to SEO success.\n\nHow Do Search Engines Work?\n\nSearch engines work by crawling, indexing, and ranking content on the internet.\n\nHere’s what each of those means:\n\nCrawling: The search engine uses automated programs (known as bots or crawlers) to explore the web and discover content. They primarily do this by following hyperlinks.\nIndexing: The search engine analyzes the content. If it's eligible, the search engine indexes the content (adds it to the database of possible search results).\nRanking: When a user enters a query, the search engine tries to understand search intent (what the searcher wants). Then uses a complex algorithm to present the best results from its index.\n\nWhen your content is presented in search results, it can take a number of forms. Like traditional search listings (the standard blue links).\n\nBut Google commonly displays SERP features (non-standard results) to make the search experience more engaging.\n\nFor example, this SERP includes a popular products section:\n\nThere are also rich snippets (normal results with extra elements).\n\nLike this one, which includes an image and a star rating:\n\nTip\n\nUse the Semrush Sensor to check the prevalence of SERP features in your category and country.\n \n\nThings that influence your presence, positioning, and appearance on the SERP are known as ranking factors.\n\nThey include: \n\nThe relevancy and quality of your content\nThe presence of keywords on your page\nThe number and quality of links you have from other sites (which can boost your reputation)\nHow you use schema markup (which helps search engines understand and categorize information on your site)\nThe speed and usability of your site\n\nNote\n\nGoogle’s process for including and ranking paid results works differently. You can learn about it in our Google Ads guide.\n\nTypes of SEO\n\nHere are some of the most important types of search engine optimization marketing:\n\nOn-Page SEO \n\nOn-page SEO is the process of optimizing webpages to improve their search visibility.\n\nIt’s largely about using keywords effectively.\n\nKeywords are relevant search terms you want the page to rank for. And they help show search engines (and users) that your content is relevant to their search.\n\nIt’s best practice to incorporate your keywords into the body content and the following locations, when it’s natural to do so:\n\nTitle tag: The HTML page title that can appear in SERPs\nMeta description: The HTML page summary that can appear in SERPs\nH1 tag: The HTML element that contains the on-page title\nSubheading tags: HTML tags that contain subheadings (H2s, H3s, etc.)\nAlt text: HTML image descriptions \nURL slug: The unique part of the webpage address\n\nIt’s important to avoid keyword stuffing (forcing in keywords where they don’t belong). Because Google considers this to be a spammy practice.\n\nViolating Google’s spam policies can lead to a penalty that harms your search visibility.\n\nTip\n\nUse Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker to get on-page SEO recommendations tailored to your site.\n \n\nTry Semrush’s SEO Tools\n\nwith Your Free Account\n\nSign Up Now →\nOff-Page SEO\n\nOff-page SEO refers to things you can do outside of your website to improve its search visibility.\n\nIt most commonly refers to link building. Which is the process of getting other high-quality websites to link to your website. \n\nThese kinds of links are called backlinks. And they can help your SEO by signaling that your website is useful and trustworthy. \n\nOther off-page tactics like social media management, online reputation management, and email marketing can indirectly benefit your SEO. By helping drive brand awareness and engagement.\n\nTip\n\nUse Semrush’s Link Building Tool to start building quality backlinks.\n\nTechnical SEO\n\nTechnical SEO is improving technical aspects of your website with the aim of improving its search visibility.\n\nThe most important thing is ensuring that search engines can crawl and index your website properly. This may involve:\n\nUsing meta robots tags and robots.txt to control the behavior of search engine bots\nCreating an XML sitemap that helps search engines understand your site structure\nBuilding internal links that help search bots (and users) navigate your site\n\nAfter that, you can focus on user experience factors such as page speed, website security, and mobile-friendliness.\n\nTip\n\nUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to check your site for over 140 on-page and technical SEO issues.\n \n\nImage SEO\n\nImage SEO is the process of optimizing images on your website so they may appear more prominently in search results. And help your wider SEO performance.\n\nFor example, image optimization can help you earn exposure like this:\n\nCommon tactics include:\n\nResizing and compressing images so they load more quickly\nAdding alt text (HTML image descriptions) that helps search engines and people using screen readers understand what images depict \nMaking sure images are visually appealing and useful to your audience\n\nGoogle displays images in the top 20 results for over half of U.S. SERPs, according to Semrush Sensor data from September 2024. And lots of users go directly to Google Images.\n\nSo, there’s a huge opportunity to earn traffic from your images. \n\nVideo SEO \n\nVideo SEO is the process of creating and optimizing videos for maximum visibility in search results. This includes results on search engines (like Google) and video platforms (like YouTube).\n\nCommon tactics include:\n\nPerforming YouTube keyword research to see what videos users search for\nAdding keywords to your video title and description\nUsing schema markup to help search engines understand embedded videos \n\nTip\n\nCheck out the range of video marketing apps available in the Semrush App Center.\n\nLocal SEO\n\nLocal SEO is an effort to improve your visibility in location-based search results.\n\nFor example, when someone searches “outdoor store near me” or “portland outdoor store”:\n\nSo, local SEO is important if you serve customers in a specific area. Or have one or more brick-and-mortar locations people can visit.\n\nOne of the most important factors in local SEO is optimizing your Google Business Profile. Because Google evaluates and ranks profiles (rather than webpages) in map-based results.\n\nOther tactics include:\n\nListing your business in online directories\nEncouraging and responding to Google reviews\nPublishing localized content on your website\n\nTip\n\nUse the Semrush Local toolkit to streamline and improve your local SEO strategy.\n\nHow to Get Started with SEO\n\nTo really understand the meaning of SEO and how it works, you need to put it into practice.\n\nHere’s how to get started:\n\nConduct a Technical SEO Audit\n\nIf search engines can’t crawl or index your site properly, your other efforts might go to waste. So, it’s smart to begin with a technical SEO audit.\n\nEnter your domain into Semrush’s Site Audit tool and click “Start Audit.”\n\nCreate or sign in to your free account (which lets you audit up to 100 pages per month). Then, follow the steps to set everything up.\n\nThe tool will check your site for over 140 issues.\n\nOnce your audit is ready, click the number in the “Errors” section:\n\nThese are the most severe SEO issues on your site.\n\nClick “Why and how to fix it” for more information about each one. And use the “Send to…” buttons to create tasks for your team in Trello, Zapier, or the Semrush CRM.\n\nOnce you’ve fixed the issues, rerun the audit to check that everything’s working properly.\n\nYou should also see your Site Health score improve.\n\nTry Semrush’s SEO Tools\n\nwith Your Free Account\n\nSign Up Now →\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research is the process of discovering what search terms your target audiences use.\n\nIt’s important because it tells you what these users want. Plus, using keywords effectively can help you rank higher for them.\n\nOne way to find keywords is with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. Enter a broad starting term that’s related to your business, choose your country, and click “Search.” \n\nThe tool will gather “Broad Match” keywords that contain your starting keyword or a close variation. \n\nWe recommend that SEO beginners filter for keywords with a low keyword difficulty score (KD %). \n\nLike this:\n\nWhy? \n\nThe lower the KD%, the weaker the competition from other sites. And the easier it should be to achieve a high organic ranking.\n\nThis is especially important when you’re just starting out in SEO.\n\nTip\n\nWith a Semrush subscription or trial, you can get a personal keyword difficulty score (PKD %) for each keyword. This measures ranking difficulty for your domain in particular.\n\nYou can also use these keyword metrics to identify the best keyword opportunities:\n\nIntent: The type of search intent behind the keyword. This can be informational, navigational, commercial, and/or transactional. It indicates what kind of content the typical user is looking for.\nVolume: The keyword search volume. Which is the average number of Google searches each month, according to our data. \nTrend: How actual search volumes have fluctuated over the past 12 months. This can help you understand if a keyword is seasonal. Or declining or increasing in popularity.\nSF: How many types of SERP features are present. Click the number to see which ones they are and get insight into search intent. Or click the icon to see the SERP for yourself.\n\nWhen you find keywords you want to target, save them with the “+” button.\n\nCreate Quality Content\n\nTo rank prominently for your target keywords, you need to create quality content—accurate and original content that satisfies search intent.\n\nFor example, people who search “best headlamps” are typically looking for product recommendations, reviews, and comparisons to help them decide which headlamp to purchase.\n\nREI caters to this intent by conducting in-depth tests. And sharing their findings in a well-written and well-presented blog post:\n\nThe page appears to be optimized for search, too.\n\nThe keyword “best headlamps” appears in the title tag, H1 tag, body content, and URL slug\nInternal links point to other, relevant pages on the site\nSchema markup helps search engines understand the article\n\nTip\n\nFor help creating search-optimized content, use Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nBuild Backlinks\n\nWhen another site links to your URL, it can indicate that your page/site is useful and trustworthy. \n\nThat’s why Google considers backlinks when ranking search results.\n\nYou can start building your reputation with Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nIt identifies link building prospects (sites that might link to you) based on your target keywords and competitors. And gives each opportunity a rating based on:\n\nThe potential benefits of earning the link (links from relevant, high-quality domains tend to carry more weight)\nThe expected difficulty in acquiring the link (some sites hand out backlinks more easily than others)\n\nThe tool then helps you to send outreach emails to your prospects. And monitor the backlinks you acquire.\n\nTrack Your Performance\n\nTo see if your efforts are working, track your SEO performance. Then, you can make any adjustments based on what you learn.\n\nFirst, import your target keywords into Semrush’s Position Tracking tool. \n\nIt lets you monitor your overall organic visibility (where 100% is a top ranking for all keywords and 0% means you rank outside the top 100 for all keywords).\n\nAnd gives you a full rankings breakdown for each keyword.\n\nYou can even sign up for alerts about important ranking changes.\n\nWe also recommend that you set up Google Analytics 4 (or an alternative analytics tool).\n\nThis will allow you to track SEO metrics like organic traffic and conversions.\n\nJust remember that it can take weeks or months to see the results that come from efforts. So, make sure to allow enough time before changing your strategy.\n\nKeep Learning SEO\n\nPracticing SEO is the best way to continue your learning journey. And could be key to growing your website’s revenue.\n\nBut before you dive in, make sure to create and explore your free Semrush account.\n\nIt gives you access to market-leading SEO tools.
