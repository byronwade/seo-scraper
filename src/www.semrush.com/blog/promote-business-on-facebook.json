  "content": "Ready to learn how to promote your business on Facebook?\n\nIn this article, we share a step-by-step guide on how to use Facebook to promote your business, reach more customers, and drive engagement.\n\nBenefits of Using Facebook for Business\n\nFacebook is one of the most used social media platforms in the world, with over 3 billion monthly active users.\n\nThis makes Facebook an essential part of social media strategy for large and small businesses.\n\nWhen you use Facebook to promote your business, you:\n\nEngage with new and loyal customers\nGain an understanding of your target audience through analytics and insights\nDrive traffic to your website or landing page\nPromote products, services, and events\nReach more potential customers with Facebook advertising\nHow to Promote Your Business on Facebook in 7 Steps\nStep 1. Set Up Your Facebook Business Page\n\nTo promote your business on Facebook, you’ll need a Business Page. \n\nWhich is managed using Facebook Business Manager (now called Meta Business Manager).\n\nTo create a Business Page, follow these steps:\n\nCreate or Log In to a Personal Facebook Account\n\nA Facebook Business Page is managed by a personal account (known as the Page Administrator).\n\nIf you already have a personal account, you can use this to create your Business Page.\n\nIf you prefer to keep your personal life and business separate, create a new Facebook account to manage your Business Page.\n\nCreate a Facebook Business Page\n\nOnce you’re logged into the correct Facebook account, navigate to the left sidebar. \n\nClick “Pages.”\n\nThen, click “Create New Page.”\n\nEnter Basic Information\n\nNext, create your Facebook Business Page by entering the following information:\n\nPage Name\n\nYour Business Page name must relate to your business and its products or services. \n\nOtherwise, audiences will struggle to form a connection between your Page and what you offer.\n\nThe name of your Business Page is one of the first impressions you make on your audience, so choose wisely.\n\nA good name is clear, concise, and tells the audience about your business.\n\nFor example, let’s say you’re a pizza parlor in Seattle, Washington, called Mario’s. \n\nAn engaging and clear Facebook Page name is “Mario’s Pizza Seattle.” It tells the audience:\n\nThe name of the business (Mario’s)\nThe product available (pizza)\nThe location (Seattle) \n\nChoose and enter your Facebook page name into the “Page name” box.\n\nCategory\n\nThe “Category” box allows you to select what type of business you are and the industry you’re in. This helps audiences understand more about your business.\n\nFor example, Mario’s could categorize itself as a restaurant, pizza place, or Italian restaurant. Depending on how they want to market themselves to an audience.\n\nStart typing your business category, and the box will autofill suggestions. Select the one that aligns most with your business.\n\nBio \n\nYour “Bio” is the description of your business and an opportunity to share more information about who you are and what you do.\n\nIn Mario’s case, we’ve let the audience know they can get a New York-style slice of pizza on the West Coast.\n\nType a business description in the “Bio” box. If you’re short on ideas, leave this section blank and come back to it later. Once you’ve filled in all your information, click “Create Page.”\n\nStep 2. Complete Your Facebook Business Page Profile\n\nInclude further details about your business to help visitors and potential customers understand more about you.\n\nThis encourages them to connect and engage with your Facebook page.\n\nProvide Your Contact Information\n\nProvide your “Contact” information to make it quick and easy for customers to know how to contact you.\n\nAdd the URL for your business website, a phone number, and an email address where customers can reach you.\n\nAdd a Location\n\nIf your large or small business has a geographical “Location”—for example, a brick-and-mortar store or an office—include this information.\n\nThis will create a hyperlink on your Facebook Business Page. \n\nWhen viewers click on the link, Google Maps will open, helping them easily navigate to your business.\n\nAdd your business address to the address section of your Facebook Page.\n\nInclude Your Hours of Operation\n\nLet customers know when you’re open for business. \n\nIf you have special hours during holidays, you can update this section to reflect your new times. Just remember to change them back afterward. \n\nAdd your business’s hours to your Facebook Business Page. Then, click “Save.”\n\nAdd a Profile Picture and Cover Image\n\nYour profile’s creative elements (i.e., your profile picture and cover image) are part of your visual brand identity.\n\nWhich helps audiences recognize your business.\n\nYou need to ensure your Facebook Business Page profile picture and cover image are eye-catching and positively represent your brand.\n\nFor example, your profile picture could be your brand logo or a campaign image. And your cover photo could show products, the latest promotion, or an event.\n\nHere’s an excellent example by coffee company Bodum:\n\nThis works well because:\n\nIt’s informative. The banner image shows coffee and tea-making essentials, something that immediately tells first-time visitors what the company is about.\nIt uses a company logo. The profile picture is the Bodum logo in their iconic brand color, red.\nIt showcases products. The image is stylish, professionally shot, and promoting the Bodum product line.\n\nYour Page profile picture and cover image must be consistent across your social media channels. \n\nOtherwise, audiences will feel confused about your brand identity.\n\nSo first, revisit your company’s social media audit to get a feel for what your profile picture and cover image should be.\n\nThen, gather the creative elements. \n\nClick “Add Profile Picture” to upload your image. And “Add Cover Photo” to upload your cover photo.\n\nHere is what we uploaded for our fictional business, Mario’s:\n\nAdd a Call-to-Action Button\n\nA call to action (CTA) is a button on your Facebook Business Page that encourages people to engage further with your business.\n\nWhich helps them on their customer journey.\n\nThe button you choose will depend on your social media goals.\n\nFor example, do you want to direct traffic to a website or landing page, encourage signups, or drive purchases?\n\nTo add a CTA, click on “Add Action Button.”\n\nSelect the CTA that best reflects the next step you want your audience to take on their journey to becoming a customer. Then, click “Next.”\n\nLink Your Business Page to WhatsApp\n\nThe next step connects your Business Page to WhatsApp—a communication tool owned by Facebook’s parent company, Meta.\n\nThis will allow visitors to your Page to contact you on the WhatsApp number you provide.\n\nWhich gives potential customers an opportunity to connect and engage with your business.\n\nEnter your WhatsApp number to connect the communications tool to your Facebook Business Page. If you’re not using WhatsApp, skip this step.\n\nInvite Friends to Connect with Your Page\n\nNext, invite your Facebook friends to connect with your new Business Page.\n\nAsking people who already know you to connect with your Business Page is a great way to build an early audience.\n\nAnd because they’re your friends and family, they might be more inclined to like and share your content. Helping improve your reach.\n\nClick “Invite Friends” to send requests.\n\nIf you want to keep your Business Page private (for now), click “Next.”\n\nTurn On Notifications\n\nLeave notifications turned on to ensure you can easily see and respond to engagement on your Business Page.\n\nFor example, comments, mentions, and direct messages.\n\nOtherwise, you might miss opportunities to interact with your target audience. \n\nAnd that’s like leaving money on the table.\n\nNext, adjust the toggle button on Facebook depending on whether you want to subscribe to marketing emails about your Page.\n\nThen, click “Done.”\n\nCongratulations! You’ve built a Facebook page to promote your business, products, and services.\n\nPro tip: Sign up for Semrush’s Social Media Toolkit to ensure you never miss an important notification. The tool helps you manage communication with your audience across Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. \n\nThis gives you a bird’s-eye-view of engagement across all your social channels.\n\nWhich helps you reply to messages quickly and easily.\n\nTrack Your Social Profiles\n\nwith the Social Media Toolkit\n\nSign up Now →\nStep 3. Create Valuable, Relevant, and Engaging Content\n\nThere are many types of social media content. And many of them could help you on your journey to learn how to market your business on Facebook.\n\nA few common Facebook content types are images, videos, text posts, Stories, user-generated content (UGC), carousels, and contests/giveaways.\n\nBut you can’t just post any old content and expect results.\n\nA good Facebook post will:\n\nProvide value for your target audience\nBe relevant and related to your audience’s interests\nGenerate engagement\n\nHere’s a brilliant Facebook post example by guitar company Fender:\n\nThis post works well because:\n\nIt’s relevant. The image shows a guitar, the main Fender product, a guaranteed interest of the company’s audience.\nIt generates engagement. Notice the #Straturday hashtag? That's used to help increase engagement and reach.\nIt provides valuable information. The post details interesting statistics related to the topic of guitars.\n\nTo create Facebook content that resonates, review your social media audit and create a Facebook content strategy by following the steps below.\n\nSocial Media Audit Review\n\nA social media audit is a document that tracks, measures, and analyzes your social media profiles and content performance.\n\nTo help create engaging content, look at your most recent audit and consider:\n\nWhich types of Facebook content drive the most engagement?\nWhich topics generate audience engagement? \nWhat campaigns on Facebook have generated the best results?\n\nIf you don’t have access to a social media audit or want to understand Facebook posts that create engagement, use Semrush’s Social Analytics.\n\nThe tool gives you an overview of follower count, post reach, post engagements, and overall engagement rate.\n\nBelow each data set, you can also see the percentage gained or lost over the given time frame. Helping you know on a deeper level the posts that grow your business. And those that don’t. \n\nTo set up Social Analytics, start by connecting your Facebook profile:\n\nNext, you need to configure and authenticate communication between Semrush and your Facebook account.\n\nLog into your Facebook account and authorize Semrush to access it by clicking “Continue as X”:\n\nNext, select the Facebook Business Page you want to connect to Social Analytics. And click “Add profiles.”\n\nFacebook Content Strategy\n\nFollow along for how to create a Facebook content strategy that drives engagement and growth.\n\nConduct Audience Research\n\nUnderstanding your target audience, their likes and dislikes, and topics that interest them helps you create Facebook content that resonates.\n\nThis helps drive engagement, such as likes, comments, and shares on your posts.\n\nAudience research needs to uncover demographics, behaviors, and characteristics. For example, age, location, interests, income, job title, and language. \n\nWhich helps you build profiles of the people engaged in your business.\n\nUse Semrush’s Audience Intelligence tool to conduct audience research.\n\nAnd use these insights to create buyer personas. Which are fictional representations of your ideal customers.\n\nYou can also use Semrush’s Persona tool to help compile your audience insights into well-defined audience personas. Making it easy to create Facebook campaigns that resonate with a specific audience.\n\nDevelop a Hashtag Strategy Related to Your Niche\n\nHashtags (e.g., #pizza) are digital markers that organize social media conversations. \n\nExploring hashtags related to your industry or niche will help you understand the topics your audience is interested in, the trends they engage with, and give you insight and ideas for a hashtag strategy of your own.\n\nUse Semrush Social to look at the hashtags your competitors use to target them in your own Facebook posts.\n\nUse Social Listening to Uncover Trends and Topics\n\nSocial listening allows you to monitor online conversations, track mentions of your brand, and gain insight into the topics and themes your audience talks about. \n\nThis helps you understand your audience on a deeper, more personal level. And you can quickly identify emerging topics and trends in real time.\n\nThe result?\n\nRelevant, timely Facebook content—just as long as the topic or trend aligns with your brand. \n\nFor example, it wouldn’t make sense for Mario’s Pizza Seattle to jump on a trend about dog grooming. Because the conversation isn’t related to their industry and won’t create new customers or growth.\n\nKeeping on top of online conversations is hard.\n\nBut Semrush’s Social Tracker makes it easy to track the topics and themes your competitors talk about. So you don’t miss an opportunity to join in the conversation.\n\nFor example, use the tool to look at your social media activity, engagement, and hashtag usage across multiple platforms. Including X (previously known as Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest. \n\nThis will help you “listen in on” the topics, themes, and content that generate engagement. Allowing you to emulate that success for your own brand.\n\nTrack Your Competitors’ Social Media\n\nwith the Social Tracker\n\nSign Up Now →\nCreate Compelling Content\n\nNow you have information about: \n\nYour target audience\nThe topics and trends they engage with\nThe hashtags and conversations your competitors use to generate engagement\n\nYou can use this to create engaging Facebook content.\n\nA good starting point is remembering that your posts must:\n\nAlign with your audience’s interests and topics they care about\nBe visually striking to capture attention and encourage engagement\nUse well-written copy that communicates a clear message\n\nHere’s a good Facebook post example from Canadian brewery Steel & Oak that shares the launch of its new stout:\n\nThis Facebook post works well because:\n\nIt aligns with the brewery audience’s interests (beer)\nIt’s visually striking and captures attention (fall-colored, hi-resolution brand image)\nUses well-written copy (shares information about their latest release in a fun, engaging way)\nStep 4. Build a Regular Posting Schedule\n\nOne of the best ways to promote your business on Facebook is sticking to a regular posting schedule.\n\nConsistent posting helps increase your social media reach and engagement. And your audience knows when to expect your posts, helping build trust.\n\nThere’s a delicate balance to posting valuable, relevant, and engaging content. Because you don’t want to overwhelm your audience by sharing too many posts.\n\nEach industry has its own ideal Facebook publishing frequency. \n\nAs a general rule of thumb, we recommend:\n\nThis is enough to stay in your audience’s mind without coming across as spam or repetitive.\n\nBut every business is different.\n\nFor example, a new B2C business looking to establish brand awareness might post more frequently than an established company. \n\nTo understand more about the best time to post, use Semrush Social. \n\nThe tool helps you see the times of the day and week when you publish content. And the times of the day and week your audience engages the most.\n\nUse this information to create a posting schedule that drives engagement. \n\nBut keeping up with a daily posting commitment is time-consuming. You need to stay organized to know what posts are coming up and which have already been shared.\n\nStep 5. Engage with Your Audience\n\nOnce your post is scheduled, you can’t sit back and expect it to perform on its own. \n\nYou must do what Facebook lets you do best—interact directly with your target audience.\n\nOtherwise, your social media reach will plummet and your engagement rate will soon follow. \n\nHere’s how to effectively engage with your audience on Facebook:\n\nReply to Comments and Inquiries\n\nReply directly to conversations happening on Facebook and Messenger to keep your audience engaged. \n\nAnswer questions and address audience comments and concerns about your business, products, or services.\n\nHere’s how we respond to customer comments on Semrush’s Facebook Page:\n\nJoin and Engage with Facebook Groups\n\nFacebook Groups are popular. With more than 1.8 billion people interacting across communities every month.\n\nSearch on Facebook for groups related to your business, industry, or niche. Join these and interact with members to establish brand awareness and build customer rapport and relationships.\n\nFor example, if you own a pizza parlor, you could look for niche groups interested in dough making, hydration ratios, and wood-fired ovens.\n\nPrioritize Customer Service\n\nUse automation to prioritize customer service on Facebook. And answer basic questions from customers—saving you time and resources.\n\nFor example, Palate, a wine shop in the south of England, sends an automated reply to customer queries sent via Facebook Messenger. \n\nThis helps address customer concerns or questions quickly, allowing the owner to focus on other areas of social media management.\n\nAutomation is helpful for basic questions such as “What time do you open?” or “Are you open on Tuesdays?” \n\nFor more questions that need more detailed replies, ensure a team member responds. Like this:\n\nThis way, your customers will feel a human connection to your business and understand you take their concerns seriously. Which improves consumer trust.\n\nTo monitor incoming messages and provide a fast response, use Semrush’s Social Inbox.\n\nThe tool collects comments, private messages, and mentions from your Facebook account, allowing you to reply to them from a single, easy-to-use interface.\n\nLog in and click “Create project.”\n\nEnter your domain name and project name. Then, click “Create project.”\n\nNavigate to the left hand of the screen. Click “Social Media” > “Social Inbox.”\n\nThen, click “Connect profiles” to connect your Facebook account:\n\nNext, follow the on-screen instructions to sign into your Facebook account:\n\nYou can even set up notifications in the tool. This helps ensure you don’t miss important comments, mentions, or direct messages from your Facebook Business Page.\n\nStep 6. Run Facebook Advertising Campaigns\n\nFacebook advertising is an effective, low-cost way to promote your business on Facebook.\n\nThe platform allows you to run Facebook ads across various customer touch points (e.g., Messenger, Marketplace, Facebook homepage, feeds, etc).\n\nAnd boost regular Facebook posts to a new audience.\n\nThis means lots of opportunities for potential new customers to notice and engage with your business.\n\nThe best part?\n\nLearning how to advertise your business on Facebook allows you to target ads to users based on specific information such as location, demographics, behavior, interests, and more.\n\nWhich makes it easy to get your business in front of people most likely to be interested in your product or service. And drive more engagement for your ad campaigns.\n\nHere’s an example of Facebook advertising by music magazine Creem:\n\nThis ad works well because: \n\nIt clearly shows the offer. Using the 47% discount splash on the main image helps the ad get noticed. \nIt uses a catchy hook. Tool and Rush are popular rock bands. Helping catch the eye of music fans. \nIt restates the offer. The copy restates what the eye-catching image states—47% off an annual subscription. This helps reinforce the message.\n\nThere are 10 different types of Facebook ads, including:\n\nImage ads\nVideo ads\nCarousel ads\nCollection ads\nInstant Experience ads\nPoll ads\nSlideshow ads\nStories ads\nLead ads\nMessenger ads\n\nIt’s important to correlate your Facebook ad campaign with your social media goals by choosing the right campaign objective:\n\nAwareness\nTraffic\nEngagement\nLeads\nApp promotion\nSales\n\nOtherwise, you’ll struggle to drive the right results from your ads. And contribute to achieving your goals.\n\nAdvertisers measure the cost of Facebook advertising campaigns by looking at cost per click (CPC). This metric tells advertisers how much they spent for each ad click.\n\nAs of December 2023, the average cost per click on Facebook was $0.88.\n\nHow much you spend on Facebook advertising will depend on your social media budget, goals, ad placement, campaign duration, and seasonality.\n\nEvery business is different. So, we recommend allocating a small budget to running Facebook ads and testing what works and what doesn’t. \n\nThen, you can scale campaigns that get results. And ditch the ones that don’t.\n\nRelated reading: How to See Your Competitors' Facebook Ads\n\nStep 7. Measure Your Success\n\nTracking and measuring your Facebook marketing efforts helps define what works and what doesn’t. \n\nSo, you can spend more time focusing on campaigns that drive results. And use this information to improve your Facebook content strategy for future campaigns.\n\nBelow, we’ve broken down common metrics for each campaign objective:\n\nFacebook comes with built-in analytics information that tells you things like engagement rate and reach. \n\nCombine this with data from Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Semrush Social for a full picture of how well promoting your business on Facebook is going.\n\nPromote Your Business on Facebook with Semrush\n\nMarketing your business on Facebook is a fast, effective way to increase your customer base, understand more about your audience, and promote products, services, and events.\n\nUse Semrush Social as your one-stop social media marketing tool.
