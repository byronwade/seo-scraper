  "content": "What Is Experiential Marketing?\n\nExperiential marketing invites consumers to interact directly with a brand to encourage brand awareness, action, and loyalty. \n\nExperiential marketing can include live events, conferences, pop-up stores, trade shows, etc. \n\nOr, online marketing tactics such as webinars and augmented reality (AR) campaigns. \n\nExperiential marketing is also referred to as engagement marketing, XM marketing, or participation marketing. \n\nHow Experiential Marketing Strengthens Your Brand\n\nExperiential marketing works because it’s an immersive experience. In other words, you’re not talking at the customer—you’re involving them. \n\nWhy is this important? \n\nBecause experiences have a lasting impact. \n\nAccording to a study by The Wharton School, experiences provide more satisfaction and happiness than material goods. They also form a bigger part of a person’s identity: \n\nExperiential purchases might also create greater feelings of social connection because consumers are more likely to talk to others about their experiences than their possessions.\n...telling stories about experiences is likely to feel more substantial and meaningful to both the speaker and listener, thereby fostering more of a bond between them.\n\nSimply put—you’re more likely to remember how a brand made you feel (your experience with them) over what you bought from them. \n\nFurther reading: How to Do Brand Positioning: A Value-Based Approach\n\nWant to enjoy these benefits for your business?\n\nHere are 10 creative examples of experiential marketing to inspire your own marketing efforts. \n\n1. Spotify Everywhere\n\nImage source: Spotify—For The Record\n\nTo educate users on its app features and brand partnerships, music streaming service Spotify created an in-person experience that engaged all five senses. \n\nIts Spotify Everywhere brand activation invited users to an “immersive house of audio where music and podcasts are everywhere you turn.” \n\nEvery room in the New York City venue featured a product or tool by a Spotify partner that you could use to listen to audio. \n\nThe house also included a kitchen with food from local bakeries and a fridge filled with Easter eggs. Within each egg was a scannable code to a Spotify playlist. \n\nImage source: Spotify—For The Record\n\nThis appealed to the brand’s Gen Z audience, who Spotify says love discovering hidden Easter eggs and new music. \n\nOf course, all this is great for those in attendance. But what about those who couldn’t get to Manhattan? \n\nSpotify extended the experience to its online audience with a live virtual tour hosted on the brand’s Instagram account. \n\nIt also decorated the venue in an Instagram-friendly palette. This inspired social mediainfluencers to share selfies with their followers. And increased the reach of the campaign. \n\nSpotify said the event was a success, resulting in buzz and shares across its social media channels.\n\nWhat You Can Learn\n\nTo show the full value of your product, think about how to bring it to life. Host events where people can come and try it out for themselves.\n\nSpotify Everywhere is a great example of how immersive marketing can educate customers in new ways. \n\nThe company added sight, touch, taste, and smell to its listening experience. Customers saw how app features and partner products could enhance their experience by getting hands on. \n\nBut your events don’t have to be as elaborate. \n\nFor instance, you could hold live demonstrations in your retail location or at community events. When people can see and touch your products, they get first-hand experience with its benefits.\n\nAnd this can be a big selling point. Because understanding all the ways a product benefits you creates the perception of getting more for your money. \n\n2. IKEA Place App\n\nImage source: IKEA Global\n\nIKEA Place is an augmented reality (AR) app that lets customers test how products fit into their homes. \n\nClick on a product (sofa, lamp, rug, table, etc.), and the app uses your phone’s camera to “place” it in your space. All products are 3D and true to scale, so you can make sure they’re right for your room before buying. \n\nIKEA Place recreates the in-store customer experience for online shoppers. It makes IKEA products accessible to more people. And helps customers make informed decisions, reducing the number of returns. \n\nIKEA has traditionally relied on its print catalog to drive in-store sales. But interest in the brochure declined. \n\nAt the same time, online sales were increasing. So, the company put more emphasis on ecommerce. And on using AR in their marketing.\n\nAnd they’re not alone. The AR Advertising market has been steadily growing in recent years. And projected to be worth $5.2 billion in 2024, and up to $7.5 billion in 2028.\n\nIKEA Place is the result of evolving to meet customer needs. It bridges the gap between catalog, store, and online shopping. And introduces the brand to more people. \n\nWhat You Can Learn \n\nListen to your target audience. Perform market research to find out what makes them more likely to buy your product. Survey current customers to learn how to make their experience better. \n\nUse their feedback to shape your experiential marketing strategy.\n\nFurther reading: Market Research: What It Is & How to Do It\n\n3. Herr’s Flavor Votes\n\nHerr’s, a Pennsylvania-based snack producer, understands the value of building relationships in their community. \n\nSo, it involves customers in developing new products.\n\nThe brand runs the “Herr’s Flavored by Philly” competition (now in its second year). They first invite local community members to nominate new flavor suggestions. The company then narrows down the list and produces the top three results.\n\nThey invite the community to try them out and pick their favorite. \n\nThe winner gets a cash prize. And Herr’s gets to build a strong sense of community among its fans. \n\nIn 2023, Herr’s made the competition even more community-centered by focusing on local small businesses. \n\nThe flavor nominees all had to be Philadelphia-based eating establishments.\n\nThe prize money was divided between the individual who nominated the flavor and the small business. \n\nThe contest made the product intriguing. And the small small business support joined people together in a cause.\n\nWhat You Can Learn\n\nUse experiential marketing to involve customers in product development. Getting feedback from customers shows you’re listening. And friendly competition boosts interest.\n\nHerr’s experiential marketing also works because there’s a payoff. So, incentivize participation. \n\nThere are different ways to do this: \n\nPrizes \nExclusive discounts \nRewards points\nFree swag\n\nThe right option depends on your product or services and what most benefits your customers. Just make sure the reward justifies the effort. \n\n4. Apple’s #ShotOniPhone Challenge\n\nImage source: Apple—Newsroom\n\nTo build excitement for its advanced camera functionality, Apple first launched its #ShotOniPhone challenge in 2015. It encouraged users around the world to submit their best photos on social media using the hashtag.\n\nApple has continued the campaign, updating it for new products. For instance, to highlight the advanced macro feature in its iPhone 13 Pro lineup, it challenged users to share photos using the feature. \n\nUsers shared their favorite iPhone 13 Pro macro photos. The company then selected the top 10 entries, which were featured on the site and used in campaigns. \n\nBy encouraging users to get involved and show off their skills, the campaign achieves several things:\n\nIt builds trust in the product by showcasing what it can do\nIt encourages user-generated content (UGC) and widespread sharing\nIt builds a sense of community among iPhone users using the hashtag\n\nThese are key ingredients in any viral campaign as they make it easy to drive word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nApple’s efforts were no exception. Currently, the #ShotOniPhone hashtag has almost 29 million posts on Instagram. \n\nWhat You Can Learn\n\nMake it easy for customers to participate in your experiential marketing campaigns. The simpler something is, the more likely people are to give it a go. \n\nAnd make marketing experiences tap into people’s interests. \n\nThe hashtag and challenge are geared toward users interested in producing top-quality images. Getting to do so and potentially having their work seen on a global scale generates participation among those users.\n\nThese elements combined increase participation. So, you get to enjoy the benefits of UGC to: \n\nCreate hype\nPromote brand trust\nDrive leads and sales\n\nFurther reading: 15 Effective Lead Generation Strategies (+ Best Practices)\n\n5. Lean Cuisine’s #WeighThis Installation\n\nImage source: Lean Cuisine on X\n\nLean Cuisine took a stand for a cause with its follower-inspired #weighthis art installation at Grand Central Station in New York City. \n\nThe frozen food brand wanted to move its image away from sometimes harmful “diet” culture and refocus on health instead. It did this by encouraging women to share the things they really want to be recognized for with the hashtag #weighthis.\n\nThey then commissioned an installation of individual scales printed with the inspiring responses.\n\nData from Edelman shows that 63% of consumers buy or advocate for brands that align with their beliefs and values. \n\nSo, it’s important to be clear on your purpose. \n\nBy showing its support for a healthier approach to self-image, Lean Cuisine strengthens brand perception and brand loyalty with customers who share its values. \n\nWhat You Can Learn \n\nAlign experiences with your brand values. \n\nA key to brand longevity is contributing something that goes beyond selling your product. Experiential marketing can be a way to raise awareness of different aspects of your purpose and mission. \n\n6.

And boost the appeal of your product. \n\n7. Gatorade Combine\n\nSports drink brand Gatorade created an opportunity for sports fans to experience a combine—a test professional sports organizations (notably the NFL) use to identify top athletes.\n\nInteractive events are an effective way to raise brand awareness and engage with your target community. In this instance, Gatorade gave its audience of sports enthusiasts a chance to test out their own athletic prowess—just like the pros. \n\nThe event took place at the SXSW conference. Fans had a chance to try out typical conditioning drills that tested speed, strength, and skill level. But with a tech twist. \n\nThe brand partnered with tech companies like Sparta Science and Xbox Kinect to offer virtual flexibility, speed, and jump stations. \n\nThe tech recorded test results and sent them to participants after the event.\n\nThis kept the connection going even after the conference to use as a baseline for their own fitness goals.\n\nMoves like these help Gatorade create a positive brand perception with customers and non-customers.\n\nWhat You Can Learn\n\nIdentify your target audience’s interests and appeal to them. \n\nCreate an experience that plays on those interests. And one that will have meaning for the participants beyond your event.\n\nFurther reading: The Complete Guide to (Effective) Customer Analysis\n\n8. Solve Pop-Up Office\n\nSolve, an ad agency in Minneapolis, took their search for a new intern to new heights with an interactive pop-up.\n\nThey took a portable version of their office to local college campuses. Students were invited to do a five-minute job assignment. The top performers got an interview right then. \n\nInstead of the standard recruiting booth with flyers, Solve offered potential candidates real-world job experience. They got to experience an authentic work environment and get a taste of the internship.\n\nWhat You Can Learn\n\nTo stand out from the competition, let your audience experience your brand.\n\nSolve took their office on the road so students could see what it was like to work with them. The unique approach also gave candidates a sense of the agency’s culture and creativity.\n\nTurning the search for an intern into an interactive experience created connections with students. And it helped generate interest by presenting a challenge with a real-world prize.\n\n9. YoastCon\n\nYoastCon is a one-day interactive SEO and marketing conference hosted by SEO software provider Yoast. \n\nAttendees enjoy talks and workshops by industry experts. They also get tips and insights from the Yoast team on how to use the product. \n\nIt’s a place to learn how to grow your business online and network with other industry professionals. All under the Yoast banner. \n\nFor Yoast customers, YoastCon strengthens their affinity with the brand. \n\nFor potential customers, the experience positions Yoast as the go-to choice for an SEO plugin. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause YoastCon proves Yoast invests in helping its audience improve. \n\nIf you’re choosing between two brands, you’re more likely to pick the one that helped you solve a problem or make a new connection. \n\nWhat You Can Learn\n\nA conference is a great way to share expertise and educate your audience. It helps build authority, credibility, and trust. And create personal connections. \n\nDon’t have the resources to launch your own conference? \n\nHost a talk, workshop, or exhibit at an event in your niche. \n\nFor instance, if you provide SEO and editing services, pitch a breakout session at a local content marketing expo.\n\n10. Mailchimp Online Events\n\nMarketing platform Mailchimp uses live events to meet and teach customers. \n\nOnline events are a great alternative to face-to-face workshops. They are: \n\nCost-effective\nConvenient to attend\nAccessible to a wider audience\n\nAnd people are comfortable with them. Post-pandemic audiences are used to interacting with brands virtually. \n\nOnline events such as webinars or livestreams offer a safe way to attend events and enjoy the same benefits an in-person audience does. \n\nAn expert hosts each Mailchimp event and shows attendees how to complete tasks on the platform (e.g., send an email campaign, import contacts, etc.). \n\nBy explaining key features and detailing steps, Mailchimp gets to show off the value of its platform. Hosts also encourage customers to follow along and ask questions, enhancing interactivity.\n\nThe company targets most events at new customers. This is a smart move. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause Mailchimp is free to use. \n\nThis means less risk for customers signing up. But it also makes it easier for those customers to walk away before they have enough experience to understand the tool. \n\nBy using experiential marketing to show new users how to make the most of the platform, Mailchimp fosters trust and loyalty. And increases customer lifetime value (CLV). \n\nWhat You Can Learn\n\nUse online events to reach a large audience and learn more about your customers. \n\nTo drive participation, align events with your product or service. And ensure there’s a clear benefit. Customers should leave more knowledgeable than they came. \n\nFor example, Mailchimp runs a webinar to show users how to send an email campaign. The description lets attendees know exactly what they’ll learn: \n\nEncourage interactivity by allowing attendees to ask questions and interact with the speaker in real time. This enhances the experience for users. \n\nIt also lets you understand the problems users are facing. So, you can address them in product updates and content marketing. \n\nFinally, set up a registration page. It’s important for two reasons: \n\n1. It lets you gauge interest in your event\n\n2. It gives you customer data for personalized email marketing\n\nHere are some more tips on how to create a successful marketing webinar: \n\nCreate Memorable Experiences\n\nExperiential marketing lets you engage customers beyond digital marketing campaigns. But its success is rooted in the same fundamentals that drive your content and ads.\n\nTo get people talking and acting, listen to your audience. And build memorable experiences around their needs.\n\nTo analyze your market and build a winning strategy, enroll in the Semrush Academy course Marketing Analysis—Where Theory Meets Practice.\n\nOr jump right into research with the help of Semrush Trends.\n\nGet Instant Market Overview and Competitive Digital Insights\n\nwith Semrush.Trends\n\nTry for Free →",
