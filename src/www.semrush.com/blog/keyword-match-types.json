  "content": "Keyword match types affect which search queries your ads show for in Google. But they don’t play a role in organic rankings.\n\nHere’s what you need to know for your PPC and SEO campaigns:\n\nWhat Are Keyword Match Types in Google Ads?\n\nIn Google Ads, the keyword match type determines the scope of search queries that could trigger your ads. Your choice affects the potential reach and relevance of your paid search results.\n\nThese are the three keyword match types:\n\nBroad match: Queries must relate to your chosen keyword (highest reach, lowest relevance)\nPhrase match: Queries must include your keyword’s meaning (medium reach, medium relevance)\nExact match: Queries must match your keyword’s meaning (lowest reach, highest relevance)\n\nYou can also use these keyword match types for negative keywords.\n\nThis means the different types of keywords in Google Ads are broad match keywords, phrase match keywords, exact match keywords, broad match negative keywords, phrase match negative keywords, and exact match negative keywords.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about each one.\n\n1. Broad Match\n\nBroad match means your ads can show when searchers use related keywords (as determined by Google’s AI). It provides the widest reach of any keyword match type.\n\nHere are some of the relevancy signals that broad match considers:\n\nOther keywords in your ad group\nThe user’s previous searches\nThe user’s location\nYour landing page content\n\nBroad match is the default keyword match type on Google Ads. It doesn’t require any special notation.\n\nSo, let’s say you bid on interior paint.\n\nYour ad could show for the following queries:\n\nLavender paint (because your ad group contains “purple paint”)\nInterior design (because it’s topically related to your keyword)\nSherwin-Williams (because your landing page mentions this paint brand)\nBuy interior paint (because the query contains your keyword’s meaning)\nPaint for interior (because the query matches your keyword’s meaning)\n\nThis means ads can reach more people who are potentially interested in your products or services. But there is a risk of showing for less relevant queries.\n\nGoogle recommends that you use broad match keywords in conjunction with Smart Bidding to “help reach searches that are relevant to your business and expected to perform within your goals.”\n\nSmart Bidding is an AI system that adjusts your bids based on expected conversions or conversion value.\n\nAs with any keyword match type, you’ll only pay when someone clicks your ad.\n\nWhen using broad match keywords, there’s also a risk of ad poaching. \n\nThis occurs when similar broad match keywords appear in multiple ad groups, causing your ads to compete against each other.\n\nTo prevent this issue, use Semrush’s PPC Keyword Tool.\n\nThe cross-group negatives function automatically adds negative keywords to your groups. To prevent overlaps that can harm your performance.\n\nCreate the Perfect Keyword List\n\nwith the PPC Keyword Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Phrase Match\n\nPhrase match means your ads can show when queries include the meaning of your keyword (as determined by Google’s AI). \n\nThis keyword match type provides a middle ground between reach and relevance.\n\nTo denote phrase match keywords in Google Ads, wrap your keyword in quotation marks.\n\nLet’s say you bid on “interior paint” (with the punctuation included).\n\nYour ad could show for the following queries:\n\nBuy interior paint (because the query contains your keyword’s meaning)\nPaint for living room (because the query contains your keyword’s meaning)\nWhite wall paint (because the query contains your keyword’s meaning)\nPaint for interior (because the query matches your keyword’s meaning)\n\nBut shouldn’t appear for more tangential queries like “lavender paint” or “interior design.”\n\nPhrase match keywords are helpful for brand and competitor campaigns. Because you can ensure that queries refer to your brand name or a competitor’s.\n\nTip: Design and optimize your Google Ads campaigns in Semrush’s PPC Keyword Tool. You can easily plan keyword match types, remove duplicate keywords, and more.\n\n3. Exact Match\n\nExact match means your ads can only show when queries have the same meaning as your keyword. \n\nTo denote phrase match keywords in Google Ads, wrap your keyword in square brackets.\n\nLet’s say you bid on [interior paint].\n\nYour ad could show for the following queries:\n\nInterior paint\nPaint for interior\nRoom paint\n\nBut shouldn’t appear for more tangential queries like “paint for living room” or “white wall paint.”\n\nPhrase match keywords are helpful if industry regulations dictate you can only advertise on specific terms.\n\nKeyword Match Types for Negative Keywords\n\nYou can use the same keyword categories (broad match, phrase match, and exact match) when adding negative keywords to your Google Ads campaign.\n\nNegative keywords are keywords you don’t want ads to show for. The matching types work a little differently:\n\nNegative broad match: Your ad won’t show if the query contains your keyword in any order\nNegative phrase match: Your ad won’t show if the query contains your keyword in the exact order\nNegative exact match: Your ad won’t show if the query is exactly the same as your keyword\n\nLet’s say you sell all kinds of interior paints except chalkboard paint.\n\nOne of the most efficient ways to set up your campaign is to create a broad match for “interior paints.” Then add a negative phrase match for “chalkboard,” “chalkboards,” “chalk board,” “blackboard,” etc.\n\nTry organizing your positive and negative keywords in Semrush’s PPC Keyword Tool. \n\nDuring the setup process, you can add keywords from Semrush. Or upload a file containing target keyword data.\n\nNext, create ad groups manually. \n\nOr take advantage of the “Auto grouping” or “1 kw = 1 gr” (one keyword equals one group) features:\n\nYou can then:\n\nClean out unwanted keyword modifiers and other elements (e.g., prepositions)\nAdd negative keywords at the group or campaign level\nAutomatically add cross-group negatives\nRemove duplicate keywords\nExport your plan in a Google Ads-friendly format\n\nCheck out the PPC Keyword Tool manual to learn more. Or sign up now to jump straight in.\n\nWhat Are Keyword Match Types in SEO?\n\nIn SEO, keyword match types aren’t really a thing.\n\nGoogle uses sophisticated algorithms to evaluate the meaning and context of each search query. Then ranks organic results based on their relevance, quality, and usability.\n\nYou don’t get to explicitly state what relevant queries you want to rank for. But adding target keywords to your content can help you rank higher.\n\nGoogle explains its organic keyword matching system like this:\n\nThe most basic signal that information is relevant is when content contains the same keywords as your search query. For example, with web pages, if those keywords appear on the page, or if they appear in the headings or body of the text, the information might be more relevant.\n\nHere are three important things to remember:\n\nYou do not necessarily need to use keywords to rank for them\nUsing a keyword does not guarantee that you’ll rank for it\nKeyword usage should always comply with Google’s spam guidelines\n\nFor help using keywords effectively, read our keyword optimization guide. \n\nOr use Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nEnter your keywords and choose your target audience.\n\nThen, click “Get recommendations.”\n\nStart typing, and the tool will review your keyword usage in real time.\n\nThe SEO Writing Assistant will also score your content’s readability, originality, and tone of voice.\n\nOptimize Your Content\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Find Keywords for PPC and SEO\n\nKeyword research allows you to find out what your target audience searches for.
