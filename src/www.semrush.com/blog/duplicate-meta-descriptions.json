  "content": "What Is a Duplicate Meta Description?\n\nDuplicate meta descriptions are meta descriptions that are the same for two or more pages on your website.\n\nA meta description is an HTML tag that holds a short summary of a webpage’s content. Search engines like Google often use them to generate descriptive snippets in search results.\n\nLet’s see what duplicate meta descriptions look like in practice.\n\nThis is an example of two pages on a single website having the same meta description.\n\nBut why are duplicate meta descriptions an issue?\n\nHere’s Why Duplicate Meta Descriptions Are Problematic\n\nDuplicate meta descriptions can have a negative impact on the user experience and click-through rates from search engine results.\n\nWhen two or more pages have the same meta descriptions, users may not be able to figure out what kind of content they can expect on each page.\n\nThat can cause confusion among your potential website visitors and cause them to seek answers elsewhere—possibly on your competitors’ websites that are ranking on the same search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nThat can lead to a lower click-through rate, a dip in organic traffic, and potentially harm to your brand’s reputation.\n\nHow to Fix Duplicate Meta Descriptions in 4 Steps\n\nLet’s explore how to easily find and fix duplicate meta descriptions in four steps.\n\n1. Find Pages With Duplicate Meta Descriptions \n\nYou can easily find pages with duplicate meta descriptions with Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nLet’s see how it works.\n\nGo to Site Audit.\n\nIf you’ve never used the tool before, have a look at these configuration instructions to set up your first project.\n\nOnce your audit is complete, go back to Site Audit.\n\nClick on the “Issues” tab.\n\nYou’ll see a list of all issues, warnings, and notices your website has.\n\nType “duplicate meta descriptions” in the search bar.\n\nClick on the “# pages” to see a list of pages affected by this issue.\n\nYou’ll see a list of all pages that have duplicate meta descriptions.\n\nBy clicking on the “# pages” next to each URL, you’ll see which other URLs have the same meta description as the one in the list.\n\nPro tip\n\nSet up daily or weekly automatic Site Audit re-crawls so you’ll be informed of duplicate meta descriptions and more than 140 other issues via email.\n\n2. Prioritize the Key Pages\n\nIf your website has a lot of duplicate meta description issues, it’s best to fix the key issues first.\n\nThe key pages to fix are those that have:\n\nHigh business importance: For example, sales landing pages with high conversion rates and/or pages that recently experienced a drop in traffic\nHigh search traffic potential: For example, pages intended to target keywords with high search volume that are seeing lots of impressions but relatively few clicks in search engines\n\nLet’s see how you can find pages with high organic impressions and few clicks.\n\nGo to Google Search Console.\n\nClick “Full report” in the “Performance” section.\n\nClick “Total clicks” > “Total impressions” > “Average CTR” to examine all three metrics at once.\n\nScroll down to the list and click “Pages.”\n\nDouble-click “CTR” to see low-performing pages.\n\nOn top of the list, you’ll see pages with the lowest CTR and high number of impressions.\n\nThese pages are showing up in search results often. But users are choosing not to click on them.\n\nBy improving meta descriptions on these pages, you may be able to increase the click-through rate and organic traffic.\n\n3. Create Unique, Descriptive Meta Descriptions\n\nFor each page you selected, write a unique meta description.\n\nLet’s have a look at some of the best practices when it comes to meta descriptions:\n\nInclude the primary target keyword. By doing that, you’ll let the reader and search engines know what to expect on your page.\nAnswer the search intent. Reassure users they’ll find what they’re looking for on your page. For example, if someone is looking for “how to style crocs,” you can start your meta description with “learn how to style crocs…”\nMake sure it aligns with the content on the page. If something’s not on the page, don’t mention it in the meta description, as that will lead to disappointment and higher bounce rates.\nKeep it short. A meta description of 105 characters (680 pixels) will be visible on both desktop and mobile.\nStart with the key information: This ensures that the keywords appear even if a portion of the meta description gets cut off by Google.\n\nUse meta description checker tools (like To The Web’s) to see what it’ll look like if it appears in the SERPs.\n\nNote\n\nKeep in mind that this preview won’t always be 100% reliable.\n\nFurther reading: How Not to Write a Meta Description\n\n4. Update Meta Descriptions on Your Website and Monitor Changes\n\nOnce you create new meta descriptions, update them in your website’s content management system (CMS).\n\nAfter you do that, you can re-run the Site Audit check to make sure you updated the meta descriptions properly.\n\nGo to Site Audit.\n\nClick “Rerun campaign.”\n\nOnce the audit is done, click “Issues” and search for “duplicate meta descriptions.”\n\nThe pages you updated should be absent from the report.\n\nIf some pages you updated still appear, double-check that you did everything correctly.\n\nFAQs About Duplicate Meta Descriptions\nHow Do I Fix Duplicate Meta Descriptions?\n\nUse a tool like Site Audit to find pages with duplicate meta descriptions. Then, write unique, descriptive meta descriptions for each page and update them on your website.\n\nCan You Use the Same Meta Description for Multiple Pages?\n\nYou should avoid this practice. The same meta descriptions for multiple pages can hurt the performance of your website in search engines. Google advises that you “create unique descriptions for each page on your site.”\n\nCan a Page Have Multiple Meta Descriptions?\n\nMultiple meta descriptions for a single page can confuse search engines. Which could affect how they display your content in SERPs.\n\nDo Duplicate Meta Descriptions Affect SEO?\n\nWhile meta descriptions are not a direct Google ranking factor, duplicate meta descriptions can cause issues with your organic click-through rate, which affects your organic traffic. When two or more pages have the same meta descriptions, users may not understand how they’re different and may choose to seek answers elsewhere.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
