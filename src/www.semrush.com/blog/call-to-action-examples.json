  "content": "What Is a Call to Action (CTA)?\n\nA call to action (CTA) is a visual prompt—usually text or a button—that directs a user to take a specific action. Like “Buy Now” or “Subscribe.”\n\nCalls to action appear all over the web. Like this clothing website that encourages people to shop:\n\nAnd on social media. Like this Facebook ad. It asks people to download a report:\n\nYou can even spot CTAs in search ads. Here’s one that asks people to call:\n\nReady to get inspired? Let’s take a look at 30 incredible call to action examples, sorted by type.\n\nInformational CTA Examples\n\nInformational CTAs lead to pages that provide additional information on your products, services, or business. \n\nLike a product page. Or an “About Us” page. \n\nThey typically include phrases like “Learn More,” “Read More,” or “Explore.”\n\nLet’s dive into some attention-grabbing examples.\n\n1. Mailchimp \n\nMailchimp’s CTA gives users a glimpse of what they’ll discover by clicking the link. In this instance, the invitation is to “Explore 300+ Integrations.” \n\nUsing a number emphasizes Mailchimp’s extensive integration capabilities. And reassures users that adding Mailchimp to their tech stack should be a pain-free experience. \n\nSo, when writing your informational CTAs, see if you can include numbers. Here are some examples:\n\nTo emphasize credibility: Read reviews from # customers\nTo emphasize thought-leadership: Access # expert guides\nTo emphasize accomplishments: View # completed projects \n2. Apple\n\nApple uses a CTA in their Google search ad that asks people to “Explore the lineup” to learn about the various computers they offer. \n\nYou can get plenty of CTA inspiration by reviewing your competitors’ ads. \n\nHere’s how.\n\nUse Semrush’s Advertising Research tool to pull all your competitors’ search ads over the years. Enter their URL and click “Search.”\n\nThen click the “Ads Copies” tab to view ads. (Change the date if you want to view past ads.)\n\nGo through these and get inspiration for your own CTAs. Consider noting what your competitors are advertising and how they frame their CTA. \n\nFor example, if they advertise a free trial, do they mention how long the trial is? \n\nWhen writing your CTAs, use what you learn from your competitors to come up with a few different options. Then test to see which ones perform best.\n\nLearn from Your Competitors’ Search Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Sakuraco \n\nSubscription box company Sakuraco has multiple CTAs in their Facebook ad:\n\nLearn more (button)\nFind out more (link)\nDiscover Japan’s Authentic Sweets\n\nAlthough Sakuraco has multiple CTAs, they all follow a similar pattern. And that pattern encourages users to click for more information.\n\nExperiment with multiple CTAs when writing ads for Facebook. Like a CTA in the headline and in the primary text. \n\nBut like Sakuraco, keep all your CTAs related to the action you want the user to take. Otherwise, they may get confused. And they won’t know what you’re asking them to do.\n\n4. Tiffany & Co\n\nJewelry company Tiffany & Co prompts visitors to follow their diamond’s journey with their CTA. \n\nThis CTA may work better than a standard “Learn More” as it tells users exactly what they’ll learn by clicking the link. And it’s directly related to the products they sell.\n\nTo write a CTA like this, ask yourself, “Why should someone click this link?” \n\nThen, mold the reason into a CTA. \n\n5. Warby Parker \n\nEyeglass supplier Warby Parker infuses their personality into their CTA. Instead of instructing users to “Learn More,” they’ve taken a different approach and asked users to “Peruse the palette.”\n\nWhen writing your CTA, think of your brand’s voice (the personality you use to communicate with your audience). \n\nThen, like Warby Parker, dress up your CTA with words and phrases unique to your brand. \n\n6. Starbucks \n\nCoffee company Starbucks uses a descriptive CTA that tells users where they’ll go after they click. Which is a page with examples of inclusion and diversity.\n\nThis type of CTA can drive traffic to a page that compiles resources. Like blog posts, case studies, testimonials, or examples. \n\nTo drive traffic to these types of pages, try CTAs like:\n\nDiscover what our customers say\nRead our case studies\nBrowse our blog\nLead Generation CTA Examples\n\nLead generation CTAs collect leads from your website by asking users for their email. These CTAs usually say something like “Subscribe” or “Sign Up.”\n\nHere are some examples of lead generation CTAs to inspire your own:\n\n7. Reformation \n\nClothing company Reformation has two CTAs in their opt-in form: \n\n“Sign up to see for yourself”\n“Give us your email address. Promise we won’t spam.”\n\nThe first CTA piques the user’s curiosity. \n\nYou can incorporate a CTA like this in your lead generation forms by telling the user why they should sign up for your email list. \n\nThe second CTA tries to eliminate any doubts the user might have. In this case, the doubt is that the emails will be spammy. \n\nGet to know your subscribers and identify their initial reservations when subscribing to your list. Then, create a CTA that addresses their concern to put future leads at ease. \n\n8. Boom! By Cindy Joseph\n\nMakeup brand Boom! By Cindy Joseph uses the CTA “Join The Club” to ask people to sign up for their email list.\n\nThe last line is also a simple but effective pun. This playfully adds a sense of urgency, suggesting that “joining the club” is long overdue.\n\nThis CTA fosters a sense of community. If you want to give your email list a community-feel, try a CTA like this:\n\nJoin the inner circle\nBe part of our network\nBecome an insider\nJoin our community\n9. Brian Kurtz \n\nCopywriter Brian Kurtz takes a different approach to the usual “Subscribe” CTA. His CTA button explicitly tells subscribers what they get in return for giving him their email address. \n\nIn this case, they get a document with direct marketing secrets. \n\nConsider replacing your “Subscribe” CTAs with something like Brian’s CTA. And tell the user what they get in return. \n\nTry something like:\n\nSend me the [item]\nGive me the [item]\nI want the [item]\nGet the [item]\nForm Submission CTA Examples\n\nForm submission CTAs require users to fill out a form—usually to contact you or book a meeting. These CTAs might read “Contact” or “Submit.”\n\nBut you can get more creative with it.\n\nHere are some examples of effective form submission CTAs:\n\n10. Impact\n\nMarketing training company Impact offers free coaching sessions for those who fill out their form. \n\nRather than a generic CTA like “Submit,” they use “Book Your Free Coaching Session.”\n\nThis makes the purpose of the form clear. And users know this form isn’t for contacting and asking questions. \n\nYou can use a similar approach by writing a CTA that tells users what happens if they fill out a form. Like “schedule a consultation” or “book a meeting.” \n\n11. Choice Screening\n\nBackground screening company Choice Screening uses a CTA that tells users that filling out the form puts them in touch with a person. As opposed to an automated reply or a support chatbot. \n\nUse your form submission CTA to highlight who users can expect to speak with after they submit your form. \n\nTry CTAs like “speak to a specialist” or “talk with our team.”\n\n12. Zendesk\n\nThis call to action button example from support company Zendesk reaffirms who the user is contacting.\n\nIf this form was titled “Contact Form” and the button said “Send” rather than “Contact Sales,” someone might fill it out hoping to reach support.\n\nHowever, this CTA eliminates confusion. And ensures people send their messages to the right place. \n\nTry this approach if your site has multiple forms that connect to different teams.\n\nEngagement CTA Examples\n\nEngagement CTAs aim to engage and interact with the user. They often involve actions like “Take a Tour,” “Watch Video,” or “Start Free Trial.”\n\nHere’s how brands write attention-grabbing engagement CTAs:\n\n13. Biteable \n\nThis CTA from video software solution Biteable reads “Make an explainer video” instead of something like “Sign Up.” \n\nThis way, people know what they can achieve by clicking the button.\n\nTo create a CTA like this, tell people what they can do with your product or service if they click the button or link. \n\n14. EventBrite\n\nEvent management website EventBrite highlights the benefits of their service with their CTA.\n\nThis CTA tells users that they can grow their events by signing up with EventBrite.\n\nIf you want to write a CTA like this, ask yourself what benefits users can realize by following through with your CTA. \n\nWill they get more confidence? Grow their business? \n\nAfter defining the benefit, use it as your CTA.\n\n15. Duolingo\n\nHere’s another benefit-focused CTA from the learning app, Duolingo. \n\nTheir CTA tells people that clicking the link will help them improve in math. \n\nA benefit-focused CTA can be effective if the landing page aligns with the highlighted benefit. \n\nIn the CTA example from Duolingo, the button leads users to a page to download the Duolingo Math app.\n\n16. Nike \n\nThis QR code call to action example from Nike demonstrates how you can use CTAs in unique ways.\n\nIf you use QR codes on things like posters or menus, add a CTA near the code. Nike adds theirs underneath the QR code. \n\nYou could also experiment with adding your CTA above or beside.\n\nEither way, your CTA should describe what happens when someone clicks the link attached to the code.\n\nIn this case, the QR code directs people to download an app (as Nike describes).\n\nPro tip\n\nQR codes work best as offline CTAs. If you’re including one on your website, make sure you also have clickable links/buttons next to it. This ensures anyone seeing it on their mobile device can still access the relevant page.\n\n17. Kiva\n\nKiva is a platform that connects lenders with borrowers. Their CTA tells readers they can “find a borrower” (people who need money for projects).\n\nTo write a CTA like this, clearly and concisely describe what people can do after they click the link.\n\nSales CTA Examples\n\nSales CTAs drive purchases and use phrases like “Shop” or “Buy Now.”\n\nLet’s look at a few other options.\n\n18. Crate&Barrel\n\nHome decor company Crate&Barrel replaces “Shop Now” with “Bring home joy” for their CTA.\n\nTry replacing your “Shop Now” CTAs with something more descriptive. And tell users what they can get if they buy your product.\n\nIn Crate&Barrel’s example, shoppers can add joy to their homes with their decor. This is more appealing than simply saying something like “Go to shop.”\n\n19. Wool and the Gang \n\nKnitting company Wool and the Gang sells knitting kits. Instead of a CTA like “Shop,” they instruct users to “Choose a Kit.”\n\nAdding “choose” to your CTA tells users they have various options. And they can find a product that suits their needs.\n\nTry a similar CTA when directing users to pages with multiple products or various pricing packages. \n\n20. James Wedmore\n\nBusiness coach James Wedmore makes a promise with his CTA:\n\nHe gives users a reason to click his CTA by telling them what they can achieve with his product—upgrading their sales pages.\n\nIf you’re unsure of how to adapt this to your own call to action, finish this sentence: “We promise our product will help you…”\n\nThen, turn the second part into your CTA. Like this:\n\nWe promise our product will help you improve your customer service\nCTA: Improve your customer service today\n21. VistaPrint \n\nPrinting company VistaPrint relies on one CTA for their Facebook ad: The “Shop now” button.\n\nRather than fill their Facebook ad with multiple CTAs (like in the example from Sakuraco), they use the copy to highlight the details of their sale. \n\nLike the discount customers get. And which code to use. \n\nTest your Facebook ads to see how many CTAs work best with your audience. You might find one is the most effective. Or that multiple CTAs perform best.\n\n22. Fenty Beauty \n\nCosmetic company Fenty Beauty uses a festive CTA (“Play The Part”) to advertise their Halloween products.\n\nAnd by adding when the sale ends (in this case, October 31), they add a sense of urgency to the CTA.\n\nConsider how you can tie your CTAs to holidays and other events. \n\nKeep in mind that this approach might not work for all businesses. \n\nFor example, a festive CTA might come across as unprofessional for a law firm. \n\n23. Hulu\n\nThese two CTAs on the welcome page for streaming service Hulu are straight to the point.\n\nThe user immediately knows which package has two channels and which has three. This is far more informative than if both buttons just said “Buy Now.”\n\nThis can make it easier for prospects to make a decision. \n\nUse a CTA like this if you have fewer than three products/options. So users can quickly spot the one they want to buy. \n\nSocial CTA Examples\n\nSocial CTAs ask people to interact with your brand via social media.\n\nLike a CTA that asks people to share a post on Facebook. Or one that asks people to follow you on Instagram. \n\nHere are a few more examples:\n\n24. HubSpot\n\nSoftware company HubSpot includes this CTA at the bottom of their blog posts. \n\nAdding text with social share icons underneath is a simple way to ask people to share your content. \n\nHere are some other examples:\n\nShare this post with your friends \nEnjoyed this content? Share it to spread the knowledge!\nKnow someone who would benefit from this? Share it with them!\n25. Memberpress\n\nWordPress plugin Memberpress also adds a CTA at the end of their blog posts. \n\nBut instead of asking people to share their content, they ask users to follow them on social media.\n\nBy adding links to each social profile, users can easily find Memberpress’s socials to stay connected. \n\n26. Vani Hari\n\nFood blogger Vani Hari asks followers on Instagram to share each recipe with their friends.\n\nAdding these CTAs to your social posts can increase your reach by encouraging those already engaging with your content to share it with their network.\n\nSupport CTA Examples\n\nSupport CTAs help users find what they need. Like a support channel. \n\nExamples of these include “Contact Us” or “Get Help.”\n\nHere are some examples of support CTAs:\n\n27. Event Connect\n\nSports software company Event Connect uses this CTA for their live chat:\n\nThis CTA tells people that a live chat will open if they click the link. \n\nBeing direct with your support CTAs helps people find the avenue of support they want. For example:\n\nCall us now\nSend us an email\nStart live chat\n28. Staff Renter \n\nStaff Renter is a recruitment firm. On their contact form, their CTA reads “Ask your question” rather than something generic like “Submit.”\n\nYou can try similar CTAs for your contact form like:\n\nReach Out\nGet in Touch\nConnect with Us\nRequest More Information\nDonation CTA Examples\n\nNonprofits use donation CTAs to ask for gifts and contributions. They usually say something like “Donate Now.”\n\nHere are a few more examples:\n\n29. Interior Wildlife\n\nWildlife rehabilitation center Interior Wildlife accepts multiple types of donations. And they make it easy for donors to find their preferred method by clearly labeling each CTA. \n\nThese clear CTAs help people quickly find a donation method that suits their needs.\n\n30. With You\n\nCharity With You also lists two CTAs for collecting donations: One for recurring donations and another for one-time donations.\n\nUsing multiple CTAs gives people a choice of how often they’d like to donate.\n\nHow to Write Effective Calls to Action\n\nThe best way to write CTAs is to ask yourself what users get if they follow through on your CTA.\n\nFor example, if you sell language courses, your CTA could be something like “Become Fluent in French.”\n\nYou can also see what your competitors have used for their CTAs. Browse their websites (including their homepage, landing pages, and sales pages) and their ads to get inspiration for your own CTA.\n\nTo view your competitors’ ads, use the Advertising Research tool.\n\nYou can also use Ads History to view a list of ads within your niche. Enter a keyword related to your niche and click “Search.” \n\nClick on the number to reveal different ads and review the CTAs they used.\n\nThis gives you an archive of examples you can use to inspire your own CTAs.\n\nReady to try it for yourself?\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account and get inspired to write your next CTA.\n\nLearn from Your Competitors’ Search Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
