  "content": "What Is Google’s ‘People Also Search For’ Feature?\n\n“People also search for\" (PASF) is a feature of Google’s search engine results. It provides users with additional search suggestions related to their original query.\n\nPASF appears on a search results page after users click on a website and then quickly navigate back to the original results.\n\nOr on mobile, PASF can show up as you scroll down the search results—before you’ve clicked on a result.\n\nGoogle launched PASF in 2018. The feature aims to make it quicker and easier for users to refine their searches.\n\nPASF data comes from Google’s own search database. \n\nThis means PASF contains valuable insights into search behaviors for website owners. “People also search for” SEO is the process of using that data to tailor your content to meet users’ needs.\n\nHow Does ‘People Also Search For’ Work?\n\nPASF generates queries based on the searcher's own history and the search patterns of others who've explored similar topics.\n\nIt’s triggered when Google thinks a user didn’t find what they were looking for.\n\nIt usually appears underneath the search result the user previously clicked on. And provides six to eight alternative search terms.\n\nDon’t mistake PASF for Google’s other search engine results page (SERP) features and other search functions like:\n\nPeople also ask (PAA): a set of questions and answers related to the search query\nRelated searches: The difference between “Related searches” and “People also search for” is that “Related searches” appear at the bottom of the SERP. And can include images and featured snippets. \nGoogle autocomplete: search queries that Google predicts in real-time as you type\nHow to Utilize ‘People Also Search For’ for SEO\n\nYou can use the related queries from PASF to improve your SEO performance by making your content more targeted, relevant, and helpful.\n\n 1. Gather New Topic Ideas\n\nUncovering related queries that are not yet addressed in your existing content can offer valuable insights and inspire new ideas for creating content.\n\nFor example, say you already have great content about dog nutrition.\n\nResearching PASF data can help you find other related search terms people are using, like “good dog food guide,” “feeding guide for dogs,” or “dog nutrition chart.”\n\nYou can then create content around these topics to attract the users searching for them. And direct more relevant traffic to your site.\n\n2. Prioritize Content Opportunities\n\nUsing data like monthly search volumes to analyze PASF queries can help you prioritize which content to create. Because you can see which terms people on Google searched for the most. Or PASF keywords with lower competition, which might be easier to rank for.\n\nYou can find out the search volumes for different search terms using the Semrush Keyword Overview tool.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nFirst, launch the tool, enter your keyword, and click “Search.”\n\nThe tool provides you with valuable metrics like search volume, keyword variations, keyword difficulty (KD), search intent, questions, and more.\n\nWith these insights, you can strategically create compelling and relevant content to enhance your online presence and meet the needs of your audience.\n\nRun a Full Keyword Analysis\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Optimize Existing Content\n\nYou can reach more searchers and better target search intent (identifying what task a user wants to fulfill and helping them do it) by adding PASF-related keywords to your existing content.\n\nFor example, say you’ve already created a great guide on dog food. \n\nYou can take a look at what people also search for around this topic and add other related search terms. Like “best dry dog food” or “healthiest food for dogs.”\n\nOr you could even upgrade your content with an entirely new section. Like “worst dog foods.”\n\n4.Create FAQs\n\nFAQs are a great way to target more keywords and provide helpful content for users. Incorporating insights from PASF suggestions into your FAQ section can help you create a comprehensive, user-friendly resource.\n\nFor example, Wells Fargo’s FAQ page attracts 2,800 organic search visitors per month (as seen in Semrush’s Domain Overview tool):\n\nThey do so by answering many different commonly searched-for queries around credit card accounts.\n\nCreating a data-driven FAQs section like this can help you target multiple relevant keywords at one time. And attract many users with a single page.\n\n5.Find Internal Linking Opportunities\n\nAdding hyperlinks to other pages on your website that answer PASF queries can help you rank for them by signaling relevant content.\n\nIt can also improve user experience and show search engines that your content is comprehensive.\n\nFor example, within your “good dog food guide,” you could include links to other guides you have on “the best dry dog food” or “the best dog food for senior dogs.”\n\nTools to Find ‘People Also Search For’ Data\nTopic Research\n\nSemrush’s Topic Research tool provides you with content ideas based on queries that people also search for.\n\nTo find content ideas that people on Google also searched for, open the tool and type in the topic you want to research. Then, hit “Get content ideas.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of cards showing related topics. You can also view the search volumes of each topic. Choose one you’re interested in exploring and click “Show more.”\n\nIn the new window, you’ll see popular headlines from Google search results and related questions that people also search for on this topic. \n\nAt the bottom, you’ll also see “Related searches.” \n\nClicking on one of these related searches will trigger a new topic search. You’ll now see a list of cards related to the new topic.\n\nFor example, if you click on \"brewing beer at home,\" you get a new list of cards related to the new topic.\n\nYou can save a topic or search query by hovering over the small icon next to it and clicking “Add to your favorites” when the option pops up. \n\nYou can come back to your “Favorites” list or share it with colleagues to get working on your content plan.\n\nFind Out What Ranks\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nKeyword Magic Tool\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool is a keyword research tool that helps you quickly see popular searches related to your topic.\n\nIt generates a responsive keyword table. And groups related search terms into topic-specific subgroups.\n\nHere’s how to use it to find PASF data:\n\nOpen the tool, enter a keyword you want to explore, and click “Search.”\n\nThis returns a list of keywords based on the original keyword you typed in. In the column to the left of this, you'll see a list of keyword subgroups. They are grouped into different topics by common keywords.\n\nIf you click the arrow to the left of the keyword, this reveals further subgroups. You can also see key data for each search query, such as search intent, search volume, and keyword difficulty (KD). \n\nKeyword difficulty means how hard it is to rank for a certain keyword. \n\nYou can set further modifiers to your search using the options at the top: broad match, phrase match, exact match, and related.\n\nHere’s what these mean:\n\nBroad Match: The tool will show all possible keyword variations and related terms. For example, if you type “roller skates,” you might see “roller skating rink” or “roller skating near me.”\nPhrase Match: The search terms returned will contain your phrase exactly but might have additional words before or after. So if you search “best roller skates,” you might see “top 10 best roller skates” or “best roller skates for kids.”\nExact Match: You’ll only see data for the exact keywords you type in\nRelated: The Keyword Magic Tool will show you a wide range of keywords that are closely related to what you typed in. Including synonyms, misspellings, related searches, and other relevant variations. So if you type in “roller skates,” you might see things like “roller skates” and “rolling skates.” But also related searches like “where do I buy roller skates” and “cheap roller skates.”\n\nFor more data, click on the “Related” modifier. \n\nAlongside the list of search terms, there’s now also a “Related” metric indicating how closely this query is related to the keyword you entered.\n\nIt’s out of 100; the higher the number, the more closely related it is.\n\nIf keywords are very closely related, you could use them to optimize existing content. And target several closely related search terms within the same piece of content.\n\nIf the term is less closely related, you may want to create a separate piece of content to target that term.\n\nGet Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nGoogle’s SERP\n\nAn important free resource for finding PASF queries is Google itself.\n\nSearch keywords or questions related to your chosen topic and see what other search suggestions Google provides.\n\nTo view PASF queries, click on a result, then click the back button to return to the SERPs.\n\nIf Google has PASF data for this query, it’ll be displayed beneath the result you clicked on. But PASF doesn’t appear for every search. So if you don’t see it, you can use one of the Semrush tools we just mentioned to find relevant and related data. \n\nYou can also see related queries via Google’s “Related searches” and autocomplete functionality.\n\nTo see “Related searches”:\n\nType your search query into Google and hit enter\nScroll down until you see the “Related searches” section, which offers suggestions for other popular searches around this topic\n\nTo see autocomplete suggestions:\n\nStart typing your search query into Google\nSee what other suggestions appear below\nMake a note of any that could be useful for creating or optimizing content\nKeywords Everywhere\n\nKeywords Everywhere is a paid browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that provides keyword information directly in the SERPs.\n\nOnce you’ve installed the extension, conduct a desktop search and two widgets will appear on the right-hand side of the SERP.\n\nThe top widget displays related keywords. The bottom one provides “People also search for” queries.\n\nYou can also see the search volume, cost per click (CPC), and competition for each search term.\n\nYou can use this data to inform your keyword and content strategies.\n\nUse PASF Keywords to Create Amazing Content\n\nOnce you’ve found high-volume related keyword opportunities based on PASF data, you can start creating content to target those terms. Which can increase traffic to your website.\n\nFor help with writing compelling SEO content that gets results, check out our guide: Content Writing: What It Is + 15 Tips for Success.\n\nAnd harness the data of Keyword Magic Tool and Topic Research to get ideas for creating and optimizing content.\n\nStart today with a free account.\n\nTry 55+ Products Free\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nCreate Free Account →",
