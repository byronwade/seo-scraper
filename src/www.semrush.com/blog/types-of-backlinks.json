  "content": "What Are Backlinks?\n\nBacklinks are links your website gets from other websites. They’re called “backlinks” because they “link back” to your website.\n\nPeople use backlinks to visit other relevant pages. \n\nAnd search engines use backlinks to:\n\nFollow to the linked page. And understand its contents.\nRecognize that the linked page is likely reputable. And may be deserving of higher rankings.\nWhy Do Backlinks Matter in SEO?\n\nThe more backlinks your website has from reputable sources, the more authoritative it can seem to search engines.\n\nWhich may help it rank higher.\n\nOur Ranking Factors study found that domains with high-ranking pages generally have more backlinks than domains with lower-ranking ones.\n\nAnd higher search rankings can lead to more organic traffic, leads, and sales. \n\nWhat Makes a Backlink Valuable?\n\nBacklinks can improve your search rankings. If they meet these conditions:\n\nThe backlink is a dofollow link: Dofollow links are standard links. Meaning they don’t contain “rel” attributes that discourage search engines from treating the links as endorsements. (We’ll cover this more later.)\nThe backlink is from an authoritative website: If a highly reputable website links to a page, search engines may also consider that page highly reputable. And rank it higher.\nThe backlink’s anchor text accurately describes the linked page: Anchor text is the text users click to visit a link. Backlinks with descriptive anchor text help search engines better understand linked pages.\nThe backlink is found on relevant websites: Search engines may treat a backlink as spam if the website it’s on has little relevance to the page it links to. Like a gardening website that links to a page on trucks for no apparent reason.\nThe backlink naturally reads as part of its surrounding content: Search engines may view links disconnected from the overall content as spam. One example is a link that appears at the end of a paragraph without being part of a sentence.\n\nWhere a backlink comes from—editorial publications, forums, social media, etc.—may also affect its value.\n\nWe’ll explain that more later. But first, let’s go over the main types of backlinks. \n\nThe 4 Main Types of Backlinks\nDofollow Backlinks\n\nDofollow backlinks (or follow backlinks) are links without a “rel” attribute in the HTML. By default, all hyperlinks are dofollow. \n\nIf you link to someone’s website but don’t change the HTML code, it would be considered a dofollow backlink.\n\nDofollow backlinks indicate you endorse the linked page. And encourage search engines to discover and possibly rank the linked pages.\n\nDofollow links look like this in HTML code: \n\n<a href=\"https://example.com/\">Visit ACME’s homepage</a>\n\nYou should use dofollow backlinks when:\n\nYou’re creating internal links, which are links to other pages on your website. To help search engines discover and index these pages.\nYou’re linking to another website’s resource because you find it helpful\n\nNote\n\n“Dofollow” and “follow” are unofficial backlink terms. But the SEO community has begun to use them to differentiate between the other types. \n\nNofollow Backlinks\n\nNofollow backlinks are links with the rel=“nofollow” attribute. Which discourages search engines from following the linked page. Or treating the link as an endorsement for higher rankings.\n\nNofollow links look like this in HTML code:\n\n<a href=\"https://example.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit ACME’s homepage</a>\n\nMaking your backlink nofollow suggests to Google you don’t want to associate your site with the linked page. Like if you’re linking to a competitor’s page. \n\nSponsored Backlinks\n\nSponsored backlinks (also known as paid links) contain the rel=“sponsored” attribute. And indicate that the person inserting the link may get paid for doing so. \n\nHere’s an example of a sponsored backlink:\n\n<a href=\"https://example.com/\" rel=\"sponsored\">Check the latest flight prices (affiliate link)</a>\n\nSearch engines generally don’t take sponsored backlinks into account when ranking pages.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they view these links as less trustworthy.\n\nAfter all, the person who added the link could have done so out of financial gain. And not because they genuinely thought it was helpful.\n\nFurther reading: How Do Affiliate Programs Work?\n\nUGC Backlinks\n\nUGC backlinks are backlinks in user-generated content. Meaning non-sponsored content that individuals—as opposed to brands—create on their own.\n\nExamples of UGC are:\n\nSocial media posts\nForum posts\nBlog post comments\n\nUGC backlinks have the rel=“ugc” attribute. And they look like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://example.com/\" rel=\"ugc\">Visit my website</a>\n\nUGC backlinks discourage search engines from following the linked pages. Or treating them as endorsements.\n\nThis is to combat link spam.\n\nFor example, a person trying to increase their website’s rankings might spam a forum with dozens of low-quality comments that include links to their website.\n\nSo, if you run a blog where users can submit UGC, mark their links with the “ugc” attribute.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s Backlink Audit tool to check for spammy backlinks to your website. And contact site owners right from the tool to ask them to remove them.\n\nBacklinks That Can Boost Your SEO\n\nHere are some kinds of backlinks that are likely to positively impact your SEO performance. \n\nNote that these are all generally dofollow backlinks. \n\nEditorial Backlinks\n\nEditorial backlinks are backlinks from publications. Meaning websites (like news sites and blogs) that produce content primarily to inform or educate.\n\nEditorial publications may link to your content if it enhances the discussion. Or if they’ve cited it as a source.\n\nFor example, Bankrate’s mortgage calculator received a backlink from online magazine Slate:\n\nReceiving dofollow links from editorial publications can help boost your rankings. \n\nBut the publication’s authority and relevance also matter.\n\nThe more respected the publication is within your industry, the more weight search engines will place on its ranking endorsement.\n\nBecause these backlinks are so valuable, it’s a good idea to understand how much of your backlink profile they make up.\n\nOpen Backlink Audit, enter your domain name, and click “Start Backlink Audit.”\n\nAfter you follow the configuration steps, you’ll be taken to the “Overview” report. \n\nLook at your “Overall Toxicity Score” to get a sense of how healthy your backlink profile is.\n\nThis one is labeled as “Low,” which means most of its backlinks come from reputable sources. \n\nBut if yours says “High” or “Medium,” that suggests you should prioritize gaining more high-quality backlinks. \n\nWe’ll go over a few ways to do that later in this article. \n\nReview Your Backlink Profile\n\nwith the Backlink Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nImage Backlinks\n\nImage backlinks are links from images. Or text linking to the image’s source or creator.\n\nFor example, Space.com included a photo credit in one of its articles: \n\nNow, the photographer has a backlink from Space.com. Potentially helping to boost their site’s authority. And rankings.\n\nVideo Backlinks\n\nVideo backlinks are links to a video’s source or creator.\n\nFor instance, The Claridge Hotel has provided video credits on this page:\n\nThese credits link to the respective video creators’ websites. So, they now have backlinks from the hotel’s website.\n\nBacklinks That Are Less Likely to Help Your SEO\n\nThese backlinks won’t help to build your authority in the way the above ones will. But they may still be beneficial.\n\nGuest Post Backlinks\n\nGuest post backlinks are backlinks from guest posts. Which are articles you write for someone else’s website or blog.\n\nGuest posting can help you reach a wider audience and promote your brand. And gain backlinks. \n\nFor example, when a writer contributes a guest post to Forbes, they receive a backlink to their website in the author bio.\n\nBut know that Google recommends marking guest post backlinks as nofollow.\n\nThis is because the contributor has intentionally added these links to their guest post. Making the endorsements less authentic.\n\nBut nofollow guest post backlinks can still have value. Because they can send traffic and leads to the contributor’s website. And even increase sales. \n\nPress Release Backlinks\n\nPress release backlinks are links in press releases that organizations share with the media to announce new business developments. And they often include links to additional information.\n\nFor example, this press release from web accessibility solutions provider UserWay mentions that its solutions are now available on Semrush’s App Center—which it links to.\n\nBut as with guest post links, these links are often nofollow ones. So, they may have little impact on your search rankings.\n\nThat said, they can still drive referral traffic to your site. And possibly lead to more branded searches in the future.\n\nFurther reading: 6 Tips to Make Your Press Release SEO Friendly in 2024\n\nComment Backlinks\n\nComment backlinks are links shared in forum, blog, social media post comments.\n\nHere’s one in the comment section of a One Dog Woof blog post:\n\nOnline comments are considered UGC. So, websites often mark these links with the rel=“ugc” attribute. And sometimes make them nofollow as well.\n\nGenerally speaking, it’s best to include links in comments only when you think it genuinely provides helpful information users are likely to appreciate.\n\nDirectory Backlinks\n\nDirectory backlinks are links from online directories like Google, Yelp, and Tripadvisor. \n\nFor example, this Tripadvisor listing for Spanish restaurant Arroceria Maribel includes a backlink to its website.\n\nLinks from directories don’t generally boost your SEO the way editorial backlinks do, but they can provide valuable referral traffic. \n\nAnd Google looks for consistency within the information you include in your listings to verify that your site is trustworthy. Which can improve your local SEO results. \n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s Listing Management tool to automatically list your business on dozens of directories. And create directory backlinks to your website at the same time.\n\nSocial Media Backlinks\n\nSocial media backlinks are links from social media profiles and posts to other websites.\n\nFor example, healthy drink retailer Innocent added a link to its website in its Instagram bio:\n\nSocial media platforms tend to add the rel=“nofollow” attribute to backlinks on their platforms. So, these backlinks may be less valuable.\n\nBut they lead to more referral traffic. And lead to more recognition that could impact your search visibility later on.\n\nFurther reading: A 6-Step Guide to Social Media for Small Businesses\n\nBacklinks That Can Harm Your SEO\n\nBacklinks that aim to manipulate search rankings can hurt your performance.\n\nPaid Dofollow Backlinks\n\nYou should never pay for dofollow backlinks. \n\nThis violates Google’s spam policies. And may result in a penalty that decreases your search engine visibility.\n\nAnd know that the payment need not involve money. Giving a person a free product so they’ll write about it—and link to your website—also counts.\n\nIf you collaborate with a website for sponsored content, those links should be nofollow or sponsored.\n\nSpammy Comment Section or Forum Post Backlinks\n\nComments and forum posts with unhelpful backlinks or an excessive number of backlinks aren’t going to help your rankings. \n\nThey might even harm your SEO performance if it’s clear that the poster is trying to manipulate search engines.\n\nIf you want to include backlinks in your forum posts and comments, add only those that truly provide value to the discussion. And sparingly.\n\nAnd keep in mind that forums may mark your backlinks as UGC anyway. \n\nHidden Widget Backlinks\n\nWidgets are apps users can install on a website by inserting a few lines of code. Like this weather widget from Tomorrow.io on The Shoals Now!’s website:\n\nIf you create widgets like this, they shouldn’t contain invisible links back to your site from websites that install your widget.\n\nBut your widget can link to your website as a form of credit. As long as the link is visible and uses the rel=“nofollow” attribute. Like Tomorrow.io’s widget.\n\nThis way, the websites that install your widget won’t inadvertently endorse you.\n\nHow to Acquire Valuable Backlinks\n\nWant to get useful, non-spammy backlinks?\n\nTry these tips:\n\nPublish Useful Content\n\nPublishing original, high-quality research can help you get dofollow backlinks from editorial publications. Because they frequently cite data and experts in their articles and link back to the original source.\n\nTake this pricing study from OpenView Venture Partners, for example.\n\nAccording to Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool, the study has gotten more than 170 backlinks since its publication in February 2023.\n\nAnd 147 of these are dofollow backlinks.\n\nCreating infographics is another option for getting backlinks from other sites. \n\nHere are a few infographic best practices that may improve your rankings outside of earning backlinks:\n\nGive your infographics descriptive filenames like “content-marketing-funnel.png.” Not “Infographic1.png.” \nAdd alternative (alt) text that provides more information on the image\nCreate an image sitemap to help search engines discover and rank your images for search queries\n\nSee How Many Backlinks You Have\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nBuild Relationships with Other Website Owners\n\nGet to know others in your industry—especially those who run authoritative websites. \n\nThis way, they’ll be more receptive to requests to include links to your website.\n\nFind high-authority websites to build relationships with using Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nEnter your domain and an optional project name.\n\nThen, click “Create project.”\n\nThen, follow the prompts to configure your project.\n\nWhen the tool has finished running, go to the “Prospects” tab to see a list of domains you can reach out to for backlinks.\n\nThe “AS” column tells you each domain’s estimated Authority Score. A higher score indicates the domain is more authoritative. And that a backlink from it may improve your rankings more.\n\nAnd the “Rating” column provides the tool’s rating (out of five) for the domain.\n\nConsider both of these metrics to prioritize domains.\n\nUse the checkboxes on the left to select the domains you want to approach for backlinks. \n\nThen, click “To In Progress” at the top of the list to add the selected domains to your “In Progress” list.\n\nNext, select the “In Progress” tab.\n\nStart researching these websites to see what types of content they publish. And review your own content to find pages that might be useful to them.\n\nOnce you do, use the “Contact” button to draft a personalized email sharing your content and asking for a link. The tool will then track your progress.\n\nSecure Valuable Backlinks\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nHow to Monitor Your Backlinks\n\nHow many types of backlinks have you received?
