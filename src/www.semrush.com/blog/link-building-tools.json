Backlink Gap\n\nSemrush’s Backlink Gap tool helps you analyze your competitors’ backlink profiles so you can identify link building opportunities.\n\nIt will show you which websites are linking to your competition but not to your website. You can then target these websites with your link building campaigns and have a better chance of securing backlinks.\n\nHere’s how to use the Backlink Gap tool:\n\nOpen the tool, add your domain and the domains of up to four competitors, and click “Find prospects.”\n\nThe tool will then display an overview of each competitor’s backlink profile. \n\nScroll down to the table and select your domain in the “Prospects for:” menu to see all the domains that link to your competitors’ websites but not to your site.\n\nYou can then sort and filter the domains by Authority Score, Semrush’s metric for measuring a domain’s overall quality and SEO performance.\n\nThis will help you identify domains that can provide valuable backlinks. To improve your visibility in search engine results. \n\nTo start a link building outreach campaign, select the domains you want to gain links from using the checkboxes and click the “+ Start outreach”button.”\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe Backlink Gap tool allows you to easily identify which websites link to multiple competitors—these will most likely be your top link building opportunities.\n\nPricing\n\nYou can start using Backlink Gap for free.

Link Building Tool\n\nThe Semrush Link Building Tool is designed to help you build backlinks at scale.\n\nYou can use it to identify link building opportunities based on your target keywords and competing websites.\n\nFrom there, you can set up an email outreach campaign and monitor your results using the built-in reports.\n\nHere’s how to use the Link Building Tool:\n\nOpen the tool, enter your domain, and click “Start Link Building.”\n\nThen, follow the configuration instructions on entering your top competitors and the keywords you want to improve your rankings for. \n\nThe tool will then present you with a list of prospects for your link building campaign. Which you can see in the “Prospects” tab.\n\nFrom here, you can review prospects by URL Type (a classification that helps you understand the domain), Authority Score, and Rating (a quality score that’s based on more than 50 factors). And add the ones you want to prioritize to your “In Progress” list.\n\nYou can then contact specific prospects by clicking the “Contact” button directly in your “In Progress” list.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nUsually, you’d need multiple tools to find link building opportunities, set up outreach campaigns, and track your results. The Link Building Tool gives you access to all these features in one central location. \n\nPricing\n\nYou can use the Link Building Tool for free for one project.

We’ve also found the Email Finder to be very accurate.\n\nPricing\n\nHunter offers a limited free plan. And the following paid plans:\n\nStarter ($49 per month)\nGrowth ($149 per month)\nBusiness ($499 per month)\n4. Mentioned - Outreach Wizard\n\nMentioned - Outreach Wizard facilitates the link building process by scanning your existing content to identify outreach prospects that are already mentioned on your site. \n\nOnce identified, this tool automatically sources their contact information and provides email templates for various outreach purposes, such as linking from another post, sharing on social media, building partnerships, and more.\n\nTo get started, simply enter your blog’s URL into the search bar and click “Scan,” and the app will source contact information and draft emails within seconds.\n\nYou can also locate and verify recipient email addresses to ensure you’re not wasting any effort. \n\nFinally, you can choose an email template to quickly reach out to the desired contacts.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nWith a few clicks, Mentioned - Outreach Wizard drastically simplifies the outreach process, from recipient email discovery to integrating email outreach with AI.\n\nPricing\n\nMentioned - Outreach Wizard offers a 7-day free trial, after which it costs $49 per month for up to 250 contacts.

Help a Reporter Out\n\nHelp a Reporter Out (HARO) isn’t a traditional link building software. It’s a platform that connects journalists with sources who can share their expertise on a particular topic. \n\nBut it’s often used by sources who want to secure backlinks in various publications.\n\nBoth big and small media outlets use the platform. Some of the most popular ones are The New York Times, Fox News, and Mashable.\n\nSources receive three HARO emails every day, Monday to Friday. And each email contains a list of requests from journalists looking for sources who can share insights for an article.\n\nLike this:\n\nAll you need to do to respond to a source request is send a reply (called a pitch) to the provided email address. \n\nIf a journalist decides to use your response, they’ll include it in their article as a quote (or quotes). And they’ll typically include a link to your website.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe large number of daily source requests means you’re likely to find backlink opportunities every day—all you need to do is consistently send replies.\n\nPricing\n\nHARO offers their Basic plan for free. Paid plans include:\n\nStandard ($19 per month)\nAdvanced ($49 per month)\nPremium ($149 per month)\n8. Help a B2B Writer\n\nHelp a B2B Writer is similar to HARO. Except it’s aimed at content marketers instead of journalists. \n\nBut it works the same. You register as a source to get daily emails with source requests.\n\nHelp a B2B Writer lets you choose specific categories you’re an expert on (e.g., sales, marketing, ecommerce, etc.). To ensure you only get relevant requests in your inbox.\n\nAnd it’s focused on B2B writers and sources. So, it’s not a great option if you’re looking to build backlinks for a B2C website.\n\nNote: Help a B2B Writer is clear that they can’t promise you’ll receive a link when your quote is used. It depends on the publication’s rules. \n\nWhat We Like\n\nFrom our experience, replies get turned into quotes and published in just a few days. Which is a lot faster compared to HARO.\n\nPricing\n\nFree link building tools are rare, but Help a B2B Writer is one of them. There are no paid plans.\n\n9. Raven Tools\n\nRaven Tools offers a suite of tools for website auditing, link building, and reporting.\n\nWhen it comes to link building, two tools stand out: the Backlink Explorer and the Link Manager.\n\nYou can use the Backlink Explorer to analyze any domain’s link profile. To examine your competitors’ backlink profiles and uncover potential link building opportunities.\n\nThe Link Manager lets you find, store, and organize link building opportunities. \n\nYou can use it to track new and lost links, categorize your backlinks for easier reporting, and export all the data. So you can use it with other tools.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe ability to add notes to each link opportunity in Link Manager comes in handy when you’re dealing with a large list.\n\nPricing\n\nRaven Tools offers the following plans:\n\nSmall Biz ($49 per month)\nStart ($109 per month)\nGrow ($199 per month)\nThrive ($299 per month)\nLead ($479 per month)\n\nAll plans come with a free seven-day trial.\n\n10. Postaga\n\nPostaga is an AI-powered link building outreach platform. You can use it to run personalized outreach campaigns and track results.\n\nPostaga can also analyze your website and recommend campaigns you should run to build more backlinks. \n\nAnd it has built-in templates for common types of link building campaigns. Such as messages focused on contributing a guest post, gaining mentions, being a podcast guest, and more.\n\nThe Opportunity Finder feature discovers which people you should contact at your target websites. And automatically provides their contact information.\n\nThen, you can set up custom email sequences. And include automated follow-ups to improve reply rates.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nPostaga’s AI assistant can quickly find information relevant to each prospect. To speed up the process of personalizing emails.\n\nPricing\n\nPostaga offers a free 14-day trial. Plans include:\n\nPro ($99 per month)\nAgency ($299 per month)\n11. Pitchbox\n\nPitchbox is an all-in-one backlink tool for both in-house SEOs and agencies.\n\nIt offers 20 ways to find prospects.

Including emails, tasks, notes, and more.\n\nYou can use it to set up email outreach sequences for link building and automate follow-ups. The software also offers an inbox for you to review and respond to all the replies you get.\n\nFinally, you can take advantage of Pitchbox’s detailed reports. To get insights into campaign performance and identify which link building tactics perform better than others.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe built-in campaign templates for the most popular link building tactics help speed up outreach.\n\nPricing\n\nPitchbox offers two plans:\n\nProfessional ($550 per month)\nEnterprise ($1,500 per month)\n12. Respona\n\nRespona is a link building outreach platform aimed at agencies and B2B software as a service (SaaS) companies. \n\nIt has a built-in search engine you can use to find backlink opportunities based on keywords.\n\nThe software also includes a number of templates you can use to quickly set up an outreach campaign.\n\nAnd Respona can help you find the right person to contact at those companies. Plus, their contact information. \n\nFrom there, you can set up email sequences and automatic follow-ups for your outreach campaigns.\n\nThere’s also a universal inbox feature that allows your entire team to collaborate on moving backlink opportunities forward.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nAI-powered personalization helps you personalize outreach emails quickly. This allows you to get better results in less time.\n\nPricing\n\nRespona offers a free 14-day trial you can use to test out their backlinks software. Paid plans include:\n\nStarter ($99 per month)\nUnlimited ($399 per month)\n13. Ontolo\n\nOntolo helps marketers find link building opportunities. It does this by checking over 80 different sources to uncover potential backlinks.\n\nYou can even upload your own link building opportunity lists to Ontolo. And then search through them using advanced search functions to find the best opportunities.\n\nThere’s also an option to export your results to a multi-tabbed, color-coded Excel spreadsheet or CSV file.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nThe large number of sources and the advanced search capabilities help you find the right prospects quickly. Ontolo can also suggest search queries you should use to find even more prospects.\n\nPricing\n\nOntolo offers the following plans:\n\nPro ($97 per month)\nAgency ($297 per month)\nCustom (individualized pricing)\n14. Linkody\n\nLinkody is designed to help you track your link building campaigns. It can let you know when you lose or gain backlinks.\n\nThe software is useful for analyzing your backlink profile and comparing it to your competitors’ backlink profiles. It can show you all the backlinks pointing to your website, along with the anchor text, dofollow/nofollow status, and more.\n\nAnd you can use Linkody to uncover potentially harmful backlinks. There’s also the option to generate a disavow file that you can submit to Google (but think carefully about whether it makes sense to disavow or remove bad links).\n\nWhat We Like\n\nLinkody generates detailed reports that include many important metrics. Like the total number of backlinks, social shares, and more.\n\nPricing\n\nLinkody offers a free 30-day trial you can use to test out the software. Plans include:\n\nWebmaster ($14.90 per month)\nAdvanced ($24.90 per month)\nPro ($49.90 per month)\nAgency ($99.90 per month)\nAgency XL ($153.90 per month)\n15. Media Monitoring\n\nMedia Monitoring is a tool that helps track online mentions of brands or specific keyphrases within a chosen period of time. This tool is useful for link building outreach and for staying informed about consumer sentiments.\n\nTo get started, just inform the tool of the keywords to flag.\n\nMedia Monitoring also offers analysis of consumer feedback, classifying mentions as positive, negative, or neutral. This helps you manage your reputation and identify potential outreach prospects.\n\nWhat We Like\n\nWith the positive, negative, and neutral sentiment filters, the Media Monitoring “Mentions” section allows for easy multi-tasking between link building outreach and reputation management.
