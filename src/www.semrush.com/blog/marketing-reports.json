  "content": "What Are Marketing Reports?\n\nMarketing reports are static, data-focused documents that summarize key aspects of a business’s marketing performance at regular intervals. \n\nHere’s a peek at an example created with Semrush’s My Reports tool:\n\nMarketing reports usually include metrics related to:\n\nReach: The number of people exposed to marketing efforts (e.g., ad impressions)\nEngagement: Positive interactions with your efforts (e.g., social media likes)\nConversion: Desirable actions resulting from your efforts (e.g. purchases)\nReturn on investment (ROI): A measure of profits as related to costs\n\nThey can provide an overview of multiple campaigns and channels or focus on one in particular. The right approach depends on your marketing strategy and resources.\n\nTip\n\nFor a real-time view of performance, you can use analytics dashboards.\n\nWhy Are Marketing Reports Important?\n\nMarketing reports are important because they provide a clear, shared, and comprehensive overview of marketing performance. \n\nThis helps you get buy-in from internal stakeholders and clients. \n\nAfter all:\n\nIf you get good results but don’t communicate them, your success might not be recognized.\n\nIf you get poor results and don’t address them, you might lose your colleagues’ trust.\n\nReporting also empowers your team to make better decisions.\n\nRather than relying on guesswork and limited datasets, marketers can get a good understanding of what’s working and what isn’t. And adapt their future efforts accordingly.\n\nBest Practices for Marketing Reporting\n\nFollow these best practices when creating your marketing reports:\n\nBe consistent. Reporting the same data types at regular intervals allows you to make useful comparisons. Take advantage of the marketing report templates and scheduling features available in My Reports.\nDon’t overwhelm. While you want to keep stakeholders informed, it’s important not to overwhelm them. Focus on the most important data only and avoid reporting too frequently.\nAddress negative results. It may be tempting to exclude negative results, but this is counterproductive. Take the opportunity to learn and share an action plan.\nShare insights. Provide your team with any useful context, conclusions, or ideas. It’s also helpful to write a short summary of each report.\nCollect reliable data. Poor-quality data leads to poor-quality reports. Make sure to collect your data from trustworthy sources.\n\nWhen your report is ready, present it to the stakeholders personally. So you can provide additional context and answer any questions.\n\n5 Marketing Report Examples\n\nWe’ve created five different types of marketing report examples to inspire you.\n\nSEO Marketing Report\n\nBelow is a snippet of an SEO marketing report created with My Reports. And data from various Semrush tools.\n\nThis section focuses on organic traffic in the previous month (how many unpaid visits the target website got from search engines). \n\nComparisons against other time periods and traffic sources provide useful context.\n\nFor insight into traffic changes, readers can look at keyword rankings (where the website positions in search results).\n\nThe report shows how many rankings were lost, gained, improved, and declined.\n\nIn SEO, end results like traffic and rankings can take time to show.\n\nThat’s why it’s helpful to include input-oriented metrics in your reports, too.\n\nFor instance, you can show how your team is progressing with tasks like building backlinks.\n\nAnd fixing technical SEO issues. \n\nThese metrics demonstrate that you’re laying the groundwork to achieve future results. \n\nCreate Automated Reports\n\nwith My Reports\n\nTry for Free →\nGoogle Ads Marketing Report\n\nThis Google Ads marketing campaign report provides an overview of key monthly metrics, including:\n\nImpressions: The number of ad views\nClicks: The number of ad clicks\nConversions: The number of conversions (e.g., purchases) resulting from ad clicks\nCTR: The percentage of impressions that generated clicks\nCost: The amount spent on advertising (in your chosen currency)\nCPC: Cost per click. Which represents cost divided by clicks. \nCost / conv.: Cost per conversion. Which represents cost divided by conversions.\nConversions Rate: The percentage of impressions that generated conversions \n\nAdditional charts show how impressions, costs, clicks, and conversions fluctuated each day:\n\nFurther down, there’s a breakdown of metrics by ad campaign.\n\nThis allows readers to learn from the highest-performing campaigns. And identify ads that require improvement.\n\nEmail Marketing Report\n\nThe email marketing report below features high-level metrics for emails sent in the previous month.\n\nData comes from the business’s email marketing platform—in this case, it’s Mailchimp.\n\nOpens Total: How many emails were opened\nOpen Rate: The percentage of sent emails that were opened\nClicks: How many times your email links were clicked \nUnsubscribed: The percentage of recipients who unsubscribed from your list\n\nReaders can also see the month-to-month changes in these figures. And assess whether performance is improving at a desirable rate.\n\nIf you send multiple types of emails, provide segmented data for each one. \n\nLike this:\n\nThat way, you can identify strengths and weaknesses in particular areas. And act on them.\n\nLocal SEO Marketing Report \n\nOur local SEO marketing report example features data from Google Business Profile.\n\nIt shows how many times the target profile was viewed in Google Search and Maps. And what kinds of actions these impressions generated.\n\nTo better understand where these impressions come from, readers can look at heatmaps from the Map Rank Tracker. Which show where the profile ranks for target keywords in nearby search locations.\n\nThe report also shows the team’s progress with securing local business listings.\n\nSocial Media Marketing Report \n\nThis social media marketing report provides an overview of metrics across multiple accounts.\n\nAudience: The number of followers (or an equivalent metric) as of the reporting date\nActivity: The number of posts published over the chosen time period\nEngagement: The number of likes, comments, etc., received over the chosen time period\n\nReaders can also view a breakdown of metrics by post. Which helps social media managers identify the best-performing content types and posting times.\n\nThis marketing report format eliminates the need to view social analytics on various platforms.\n\nTip\n\nFor more inspiration, check out these marketing report examples and templates. \n\nAutomate Your Marketing Reports\n\nSemrush’s My Reports tool makes it quick and easy to create marketing reports.\n\nTake advantage of the marketing report templates provided.

Or create a shareable link to an online dashboard.\n\nCreate Automated Reports\n\nwith My Reports\n\nTry for Free →",
