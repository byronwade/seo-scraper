  "content": "What Is a Landing Page?\n\nA landing page is a webpage designed to persuade users to take a specific action. For example, signing up for a newsletter, purchasing a product, or registering for an event.\n\nUsers often arrive at landing pages via a pay-per-click advertising campaign. But they may also find your landing page through your homepage, social media posts, organic search results, and email campaigns.\n\nBoth landing pages and your homepage are often the first experiences visitors have with your website. But they serve different purposes.\n\nLet’s go over what makes them distinct. \n\nHomepage vs. Landing Page\n\nA homepage contains general information about your company. \n\nIt has navigation linking to other pages on your site. And usually has multiple calls to action (CTAs). Like ones encouraging visitors to browse the blog, explore products and services, and sign up for a newsletter.\n\nA landing page is a standalone page with a single CTA that encourages users to take a specific action. Such as purchasing a promoted product, filling out a form, or downloading a resource. \n\nAnd landing pages don’t have much (or any) navigation to other parts of your site. \n\nIn short, landing pages are where you turn visitors into leads. Or leads into customers. \n\nTake a look at this landing page template as an example. \n\nNotice that it has minimal navigation, a straightforward message, and a single (but prominent) CTA. In this case, the goal is to get the visitor to sign up for something like a subscription or digital event.\n\nWhy Are Landing Pages Important?\n\nLanding pages can boost the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns. Because your homepage and product or service pages probably won’t generate as many leads or conversions as a dedicated landing page can.\n\nPlus, landing pages:\n\nProvide targeted messaging that matches visitor expectations \nSimplify campaign measurement with easy tracking and analysis\nAllow you to experiment with different elements (headline, CTA, etc.) without affecting your main website\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nLanding pages provide a focused and optimized experience for your visitors. Which increases the likelihood of conversions to drive better results for your marketing campaigns.\n\nHow Do Landing Pages Work?\n\nA landing page should be your visitor’s last step before they convert. (Become a lead or customer.)\n\nThat means landing pages are great for:\n\nGetting email signups\nSelling a product or driving pre-orders\nDistributing marketing materials (like ebooks and catalogs)\nLinking users to a downloadable app \nRegistering users for an event\nScheduling a demo or sales call\n\nBut landing pages are not so great for:\n\nPresenting several different products or services\nLinking to other pages on your website\nTelling your company story\n\nYour visitors should arrive at your landing page as a result of the marketing activities you use that align with your goals. \n\nFor example, they might click on your ad in Google’s search results. Or a post on social media. \n\nUsers can also be directed to a landing page from your website itself. Like if you include a button in a blog post that links to a product page for a product the article describes.\n\nTypes of Landing Pages\n\nLanding pages can be classified into two main types: Lead generation landing pages and click-through landing pages.\n\nLead Generation Landing Pages\n\nLead generation landing pages are designed to capture visitor information like names, email addresses, and/or phone numbers. Often in exchange for a free offer or resource like an ebook, whitepaper, or webinar.\n\nThese pages typically feature a lead form and a clear, compelling headline that explains the benefits of the resource.\n\nExample: \n\nClick-Through Landing Pages\n\nClick-through landing pages are designed to persuade users to click through to a specific page and take a specific action there. Such as making a purchase or signing up for a free trial.\n\nThese pages typically feature a clear and compelling headline, persuasive copy, and a clear CTA button. \n\nLike this:\n\nWhen Should You Use a Landing Page?\n\nHere are four common reasons why you might want to build a landing page:\n\nProduct Launches\n\nProduct-launch landing pages give visitors information about your new product. And tell them how to buy it. \n\nThese landing pages might contain elements like a “Buy Now” button. Or a pre-order form.\n\nFor instance, beverage company Seedlip has a landing page with information on their new drink. And it has product details, recipe ideas, and links for people to buy.\n\nThe purpose of this landing page is to get visitors to buy the new, non-alcoholic spirit from Seedlip.\n\nService Pairing or Inquiry\n\nFor service providers, landing pages are often designed around providing custom quotes or pairing visitors with a personalized offering. To give them additional information that can persuade them to take the next step. \n\nFor example, this Forbes landing page describes the benefits of financial advisors and entices visitors to use their matching tool. \n\nThose CTAs lead to a questionnaire aimed at matching the visitor with a Forbes financial advisor. \n\nThe purpose of this landing page is to turn people into leads. \n\nSpecial Promotions\n\nLanding pages that promote special offers have a time limit. Which gets people excited to take part.\n\nFor example, Spotify’s landing page offers a limited-time offer to try their Spotify Premium option. \n\nThe landing page has pricing information, FAQs, and details what people get when they subscribe.\n\nThe purpose of this landing page is to convert visitors to become Spotify subscribers. \n\nEvents\n\nEvent landing pages make it easy for prospective attendees to learn about—and register for—your event. \n\nFor example, this event landing page from candle company Milkjar describes their Mother’s Day Workshops. Including what to expect, the cost to attend, the available sessions, and a link to register.\n\nThe purpose of this landing page is to attract event attendees.\n\nHow to Create a Landing Page\n\nA landing page is designed around a single action. But they might not complete that action if they get distracted.\n\nSo, it’s important to keep landing pages as simple as you can.\n\nThat means landing pages generally shouldn’t include a top-navigation menu that might take visitors’ focus away from making a purchase decision. If they leave your landing page to go read your latest blog post, you might lose out on a lead or a sale.\n\nTake this landing page from Slack as an example. It’s simple, clean, and direct.\n\nLet’s explore how to create a landing page like this.\n\nChoose a Landing Page Builder\n\nLanding page builders help you create low- to no-code landing pages. Many of them use drag-and-drop technology. So you can build your landing pages visually. \n\nPopular options for landing page builders include:\n\nElementor (WordPress)\nDivi (WordPress)\nUcraft\nCarrd\nBeaver Builder (WordPress)\nGoogle Sites\n\nThe landing page builder you choose depends on your needs. \n\nFor example, if you already have a WordPress website, you may want a plugin designed to work with WordPress specifically.\n\nIf you don’t have a website yet, you have more options.\n\nSimplify the decision by using the Landing Page Builder app from the Semrush App Center. \n\nIt can help you create and publish high-converting landing pages. No coding skills required. \n\nAnd you can publish it on your domain by using the direct WordPress option, manually changing the URL, or embedding the page on your site’s server. \n\nCreate Impactful Landing Pages\n\nwith Landing Page Builder\n\nTry for Free →\nCreate a Compelling Hero Image\n\nA hero image is a graphical element designed to make your landing page more visually appealing. \n\nIt’s big, eye-catching, and located near the top of the page. Like this one:\n\nOr this one, which sits behind the text:\n\nSome companies use hero images that show a literal representation of their product or service.\n\nFor example, if you run a food delivery service, your hero image might be a photo of delicious-looking food:\n\nOther companies’ hero images don’t show the product or service at all. But are intended to create a positive first impression with the brand.\n\nLike this landing page’s colorful illustration of two people standing atop a hill:\n\nTo find a picture to use for your hero image, check out free stock image libraries like Pixabay, Pexels, and Unsplash (Landing Page Builder lets you access Unsplash images directly within the tool).\n\nOr, hire a designer who can brainstorm ideas and create hero images that are visually pleasing. \n\nHere are some best practices to follow when creating hero images:\n\nKeep the image simple and uncluttered to avoid overwhelming the user\nMake sure your image complements the overall design and style of your landing page\nUse a hero image that helps the user understand the value of your product or service\nUse only high-quality images\nCraft a Catchy Headline and Subheading\n\nA catchy headline engages the visitor and helps them understand your offer.\n\nThe headline could be a value proposition. Like this:\n\nOr it might describe what the visitor can expect when they click through. Like the discount offer from Spotify:\n\nSome headlines are followed by a subheading that’s written in a smaller font than the headline. And provides more details and an additional nudge to get people to convert. \n\nFor example, Paramount Plus’s landing page has the headline “A Mountain of Entertainment.”\n\nAnd underneath that, a subheading contains details about the subscription options and pricing:\n\nHere's a formula you can use for your headlines and subheadings:\n\nHeadline: [Main benefit visitors will get, in 10 or fewer words]\nSubheading: [Details or additional benefits, in under 20 words]\n\nHere are some additional ideas for crafting good landing page headlines:\n\nUse strong words that encourage the user to take action (“unlock,” “upgrade,” “boost,” “transform,” etc.) \nUse emotional language that speaks to the user’s pain points or desires\nIf possible, use numbers or statistics to emphasize the value of your product or service\nWrite Concise Supporting Copy\n\nSupporting copy is the text that describes your offer in more detail. It’s usually a few sentences long.\n\nNot every landing page needs supporting copy. Often, a headline, a subheading, and an attractive hero image will do the trick.\n\nBut sometimes, adding extra details can convince people to take action. \n\nFor example, check out the supporting copy on Audible’s landing page. It describes an additional benefit that isn’t mentioned in the headline or subheading:\n\nIf you're not sure what to use for supporting copy, ask yourself: “Is there anything important that can't fit into the headline and subheading?” \n\nIf so, add it. \n\nTry to keep it brief. Which you can do by using bullet points to highlight the most important details.\n\nIf you need help writing search-optimized copy, try Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nThe tool grades your copy based on readability, tone of voice, originality, and SEO potential. And it offers writing suggestions to improve it.\n\nWrite Search-Optimized Landing Page Copy\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign Up Now →\nAdd a Form\n\nFor lead generation landing pages, you’ll need to include a form for the user to enter their information. Otherwise, you may not get the lead.\n\nYou can ask for as much information as you want. But know that more fields typically lead to fewer people filling them out, according to an analysis from HubSpot.\n\nIn fact, many businesses ask for just an email address. To maximize conversions.\n\nIt can be worth asking visitors for information like their names, phone numbers, locations, and preferences. But only if the additional info will help you convert those prospects later.\n\nFor example, say you sell both cat toys and dog toys. In that case, you could add a field to your form asking what kind of pet the visitor has. \n\nThat way, you’ll be able to feature the products they’re most likely to buy in your future marketing emails.\n\nAdd a Strong Call to Action \n\nA CTA is a prompt that encourages users to take the next step with your business. And it’s often a button or link on the landing page. \n\nVisitors might click on a CTA to:\n\nPurchase a product or service\nInstall an app\nSign up for an event\nDownload an ebook\nSubscribe to a company newsletter\n\nThe CTA should be prominently displayed. \n\nSome landing pages place it immediately after a headline or subheading. \n\nLike this:\n\nIf your landing page includes a form, the CTA will come after it. And clicking the CTA button will submit the information entered in the form.\n\nHere’s an example from our own landing page:\n\nThe CTA on the button should indicate what’s going to happen when the visitor clicks it. For example:\n\nIf the landing page is for newsletter subscriptions, the CTA might read “Sign up”\nIf the landing page is for a free trial of your product, the CTA might read “Try it now”\nIf the button click kicks off a product flow, the CTA might read “Get started”\nIf the button click leads to a purchase page, the CTA might read “Buy now”\n\nIt’s also a best practice to include your CTA multiple times on the page. Especially for longer landing pages. \n\nFor example, an additional CTA might follow your supporting copy. That way, any visitors reading your supporting copy won’t have to scroll back up to convert.\n\n6 Landing Page Best Practices\n\nThese tactics will help you create landing pages that engage and convert users: \n\n1. Use Consistent Messaging\n\nConsistent messaging across all touchpoints (ads, emails, social copy, and landing pages) helps convey your main message. \n\nThink of it this way: \n\nSay you get a store flier that advertises a 75% off sale. But when you get to the store, you don’t see anything indicating there’s a sale. \n\nYou might ask a sales associate. But you might also feel confused and annoyed. And leave. \n\nThe same thing can happen to your audience when they interact with your brand online. They need consistent messaging to convert. \n\n2. Simplify Forms\n\nSimplified forms (like checkout forms) can help you convert more users.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause 22% of U.S. survey respondents say they’ve abandoned a purchase because the checkout process was too long. Which can be related to the number of form fields users need to fill out.\n\nSo, trim your forms down to the essential information you need. Which could include:\n\nA single name field (rather than one each for first, middle, and last)\nEmail address\nShipping address\nBilling address (or a checkbox where users can tick that their billing address is the same as their shipping address)\nCredit card information\nCoupon code\n\nHere’s an example of a simple checkout form from online marketplace Etsy.\n\n3. Add Social Proof\n\nSocial proof supports a psychological phenomenon involving people looking to others to help make decisions. Meaning including it on your landing page can be quite persuasive.\n\nFor example, someone looking to buy a new bike might read testimonials and watch video reviews to see what other people have to say. And what they find can nudge them toward a purchase. Or dissuade them completely.\n\nSome examples of social proof you could include on a landing page include:\n\nReviews and testimonials (video and written)\nAggregate star rating\nNumber of products sold\nNumber of social shares\n\nAuthor Jen Sincero includes written and video testimonials on her landing page:\n\nTry to incorporate multiple elements of social proof throughout your landing page if you can. Especially near the top, so users don’t need to scroll too far.\n\n4. Improve Page Speed\n\nFast-loading pages improve the user experience. Because they prevent users from becoming frustrated and hitting the back button. \n\nSite speed is also a ranking factor for Google. Meaning having swiftly loading landing pages can help you rank higher in search results. \n\nHere are a few suggestions to help your landing pages run fast:\n\nResize large images to fit your site’s maximum width. If your site’s maximum width is 1,000 pixels resize your images to be 1,000 pixels or less\nCompress images (make the file size smaller). Tools like TinyPNG can make your image file sizes smaller without affecting their quality\nUse a content delivery network (CDN). A CDN is a network of servers across different geographical locations. When a user visits your landing page, the server closest to them serves it, making it load faster.\nMinify Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Minifying Javascript, CSS, and HTML is when you condense code (by removing elements like line breaks). It makes it easier for computers to process it. Plugins like WP Rocket can automatically minify this code for you.\n\nYou can also test your landing pages to see how quickly they load using Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool.\n\nIt will give you an overall score and also provide recommendations for what you can do to improve.\n\n5. Perform A/B Testing\n\nA/B testing is when you test two variants to see which one performs best. For landing pages, that means which one converts better.\n\nFor example, you might create two landing pages with different images and the same headline. To test which image leads to more conversions. \n\nConsider A/B testing things like:\n\nCTA text\nHeadlines \nSubheadings\nImages\nSocial proof elements\nPage layout and object placements\n6. Optimize Your Landing Page for Search Engines\n\nOptimizing landing pages for search engines can help you appear in organic (unpaid) search results. Which can help more people see your offers without additional paid ad investments. \n\nLet’s say you're a photographer in Chicago. And you have a landing page for family photography sessions. \n\nYou might show up in the search results for queries like “family photographer in chicago” if that page is optimized with on-page SEO tactics like including internal links and adding relevant keywords to your content. \n\nSemrush’s On Page SEO Checker gives you custom tips for optimizing your landing pages.\n\nTo use it, configure your On Page SEO Checker settings (make sure to include your landing pages when setting up your “Pages and target keywords”). And click “Collect ideas.”\n\nWhen it’s done running, the tool will display a report. \n\nClick the “Optimization Ideas” tab. Then, enter your landing page’s URL into the search bar and click the “# ideas” button next to it.\n\nYou’ll get a list of ideas to improve your landing page’s on-page SEO. \n\nHover over “About” to get more information for each idea.\n\nImplement the ideas listed here to increase your chances of ranking higher.\n\nGet Landing Page Optimization Ideas\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nSign Up Now →\nAdditional Landing Page Examples to Inspire You\n\nLet’s take a look at some example landing pages. And explore how they use the page elements we’ve discussed above to maximize conversions.\n\nBestow\n\nBestow is an online life insurance broker. This is what one of its landing pages looks like:\n\nIt contains a hero image of two children standing in front of a hedge to serve as a visual reminder that life insurance is meant to protect your loved ones. Without showing the product itself.\n\nThe landing page’s headline and subheading both explain that applying for their product is easy.\n\nAnd one sentence of supporting copy gives one additional detail: The specific type of life insurance Bestow offers.\n\nThere are also two CTAs on the page.\n\nOne says, “Get a Quote.” And when a visitor clicks through to the next page from there, they’re asked to provide some information about themselves:\n\nThis type of page provides a service to the visitor to help them make a purchase decision. And also lets the business collect information about a prospect to generate a lead. Who they can market to later if they don’t become a customer right away.\n\nThe other button on Bestow’s landing page reads “Apply Now.” \n\nThis is for users who don’t need additional information about life insurance and are ready to apply for coverage. To convert.\n\nWhen clicked, the “Apply Now” button takes the visitor to a page that looks like this:\n\nAs you can see, it asks some of the same questions as the “Get a Quote” page. But it also includes more personal questions, like the visitor’s home address.\n\nWhen a customer fills out this form, the company will determine if they qualify to purchase a life insurance policy. If they do, they can purchase the policy right then. \n\nLinkedIn Premium\n\nLinkedIn’s premium service comes with a one-month free trial, which is accessible via this landing page:\n\nHere, the hero image is a cartoon that depicts LinkedIn Premium in action. It features a function that isn’t available to non-premium subscribers. \n\nThe page also uses a large headline to entice visitors to click. And two CTAs. \n\nOne is a button that says, “Try free for 1 month.” The other is a button in a different style that says, “Start my free trial.”\n\nHaving more than one CTA gives users multiple opportunities to click the offer. Depending on where they are on the page. \n\nBoth CTAs lead to the same page to sign in:\n\nIf visitors already have a free account, they can be sold on an additional product after logging in.\n\nAnd if they have an account, they’ll be able to make one in order to claim the offer. And even if they don’t end up signing up for the trial, they can be reached with additional offers later.\n\nTor Books\n\nScience fiction and fantasy book publisher Tor offers a free ebook each month. \n\nTheir landing page that promotes the offer looks like this:\n\nAn image of the ebook’s cover serves as the hero image. \n\nA headline details the offer: A book-of-the-month club. And the subheading gives a one-sentence summary of that month’s ebook.\n\nThere’s also supporting copy describing the plot. To ensure users know what the ebook is about.\n\nThe page has two CTAs. \n\nOne is a button intended for people who are already Tor customers. If the visitor has already subscribed to Tor’s book-of-the-month club, they can click “Confirm Now” to get the free ebook.\n\nThe other CTA button (“Sign Me Up!”) appears below a form asking visitors to fill in some information, accept terms and conditions, and opt in to newsletters.\n\nHaving these two CTAs means Tor can convert multiple sets of users. \n\nStart Creating Effective Landing Pages\n\nAn optimized landing page has the potential to drive leads and sales for your business without increasing your paid ad budget. \n\nBut before you can get those leads and sales, your landing page needs organic traffic.\n\nSemrush’s tools can help you optimize your landing pages so they rank high in search results. And drive traffic that turns into prospects and customers.\n\nReady to give it a try?\n\nSign up to explore Semrush for free.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
