  "content": "Ecommerce trends in 2024 are transforming how online retailers attract shoppers, create loyal customers, and personalize brand experiences. In both B2C and B2B spaces.\n\nIf you're still using last year's marketing channels, technology, and playbook, your ecommerce business may miss key opportunities to grow revenue and your customer base.\n\nSo, what are the current trends in ecommerce? \n\nIn this article, we'll explore 17 trends currently shaping online shopping—including new marketing channels, advanced ecommerce technologies, and personalization strategies. To help you keep up and shape your ebusiness’s marketing strategy accordingly.\n\n1. Increased Competition for Advertising Space\n\nEcommerce business owners now have more options to promote their products across Google's advertising networks. \n\nBoth Shopping and Performance Max campaigns use Google Merchant Center feeds to display ecommerce product listing ads (PLAs) at the top of search results.\n\nLike this:\n\nGoogle Ads introduced generative AI tools for Performance Max campaigns in late 2023. The tools allow advertisers to create headlines, descriptions, and images with AI. \n\nNow that these campaigns are even easier to launch, they will likely lead to more ads—and higher competition as a result.\n\nTo create successful campaigns, you need more insight into other advertisers' strategies. Use Semrush's PLA Research to find your competitors' PLAs and see which ads show for specific keywords.\n\nOpen the “Advertising” drop-down menu and select “PLA Research.” Enter a competitor's domain in the tool and click \"Search.\"\n\nYou'll see a complete list of the ecommerce domain's PLAs. The “PLA Positions” chart shows competitor keywords, product titles, each ad's average position, keyword search volume, and more.\n\nFind top-performing PLAs for keywords your business wants to target. Then optimize your ads using your competitors' product titles as a guide. Continue checking PLA Research to monitor how your ads fare against the competition.\n\nElevate Your Google Shopping Strategy\n\nwith the PLA Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Personalized Shopping Experiences\n\nGeneric shopping experiences are no longer the norm for online channels. Research by McKinsey shows that 71% of digital consumers expect a personalized shopping experience.\n\nCustomization can prompt customers to resume browsing, repurchase items, and explore trending products. \n\nFurther, companies that master this kind of ecommerce customer experience reportedly generate 40% more revenue from personalization practices than other businesses.\n\nTo provide a personalized digital experience on your ecommerce site, you need data like:\n\nConsumer preferences, including browsing and shopping history\nWhat products customers are most likely to purchase together\nHow frequently customers tend to repurchase specific items\n\nFor example, Amazon uses data analytics and AI to customize the shopping experience.\n\nThe online marketplace encourages buyers to continue browsing previously viewed products—and to repurchase items.\n\n3. Upselling and Cross-Selling with AI\n\nMany of the best ecommerce businesses use AI to upsell and cross-sell items during checkout.\n\nSuch AI-powered tools help retailers analyze customer shopping habits. They can identify products people frequently buy together and items they purchase after considering others. \n\nEcommerce retailers often boost average order value (AOV) by using AI to recommend relevant add-ons and alternatives. Upselling generally increases revenue by 10% to 30%, according to BDOW! (formerlySumo).\n\nHere's an example:\n\nOutdoor gear brand REI recommends similar products that other online shoppers viewed or bought. Many carry a higher price than the original item.\n\nAfter customers add items to their cart, REI cross-sells accessories, related gear, and complementary clothing. This way:\n\n4. AI-Powered Chatbots\n\nAI-powered chatbots are increasingly replacing traditional customer engagement and support channels like phone and email. \n\nGartner predicts that about a quarter of organizations will use chatbots as their primary customer service channel by 2027.\n\nThe most sophisticated chatbots act more like ecommerce virtual assistants, handling complex customer service interactions and providing 24/7 personalized support. Some respond to consumer behavior by offering shopping assistance and styling advice.\n\nFor instance, fashion brand Uniqlo’s IQ Virtual Shopping Assistant performs searches for shoppers, provides product recommendations, and answers questions about inventory.\n\nWhen necessary, Uniqlo also directs customers to relevant resources for more info.\n\n5. Shopping Directly on Social Media Platforms\n\nConsumers don't have to visit ecommerce websites and online marketplaces to shop. In 2024, many ecommerce retailers have begun selling products on social media platforms—for social commerce purposes.\n\nAn October 2023 eMarketer study shows that 19% of respondents purchased on Facebook in one month. And 14% bought on Instagram while 10% shopped on YouTube. Although TikTok Shop only launched in September 2023, 10% of respondents had already purchased on the platform by that time.\n\nIn the example below, customers can tap the \"Shop\" button on Spindrift Sparkling Water’s Instagram profile:\n\nBrands can also tag items in Instagram posts, reels, and stories. Like in this Spindrift Instagram post:\n\nMeaning customers can browse and buy items without leaving the social media channel.\n\n6. Seamless Shopping Experiences Across Platforms\n\nCustomers often interact with a brand multiple times across channels before purchasing. \n\nNot all customer touchpoints involve a website visit. People may use your app, browse your marketplace listing, or visit your shop on social media.\n\nAim to create a consistent shopping experience on all platforms and devices. You'll build customer trust and reduce frustration, making it easier to browse and buy.\n\nFor instance, US retailer Target offers a seamless experience from its website to its mobile app—allowing shoppers to map out their own customer journey.\n\nTarget's ecommerce navigation and checkout flow are very similar across devices. Creating a cohesive experience for shoppers.\n\n7. Emphasis on High-Quality Creative\n\nMarketing creative—the visual aspect of your content—has become increasingly useful for engaging customers, driving conversions, and generating online retail sales. \n\nA Marketing Week study shows that 80.5% of marketers rate creative among the most influential factors when it comes to campaign success.\n\nSo, consider creative assets as essential ecommerce marketing tools for your brand. And invest in high-quality images, videos, plus interactive content across channels.\n\nTake accessories company Mokuyobi. The brand's Instagram grid features bright, colorful images—like this post:\n\nMokuyobi adds product tags to images (above) and short-form reels (below) to make the content more shoppable.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush Social Tracker to measure your social media performance and identify top-performing marketing creative. Then, replicate its style and aesthetic to drive more engagement and conversions.\n\n8. Augmented Reality (AR) Shopping Experiences\n\nAR shopping allows consumers to experience products virtually instead of in person. \n\nForesight Factory found that three in 10 consumers prefer trying on clothing with AR rather than in-store. And predicts sales growth as a direct result of an AR shopping surge by 2025.\n\nThis emerging trend in ecommerce is ideal for:\n\nClothing\nAccessories\nMakeup\nFurniture\nHome goods\n\nLet’s take EyeBuyDirect. The prescription eyewear brand offers an AR tool that lets shoppers try on glasses by uploading a selfie or using the live camera feed.\n\n9. Voice Search Optimization\n\nData from Statista shows that consumers in 2021 used voice assistants to make $4.6 billion in ecommerce purchases. The figure grew exponentially to $19.4 billion in 2023.\n\nOptimize for voice shopping to leverage this ecommerce growth trend. Make your products visible to the most popular voice assistants (Alexa and Google Assistant) and smart speakers (Amazon Echo and Google Home). \n\nHere’s how:\n\nInclude Amazon keywords in product descriptions to make your ecommerce items easier to find on Amazon. As the products become more popular, Alexa will be more likely to suggest them for item requests.\nUse ecommerce SEO best practices like incorporating keyword research and optimizing for on-page SEO elements. These steps will make your products more visible across Google Search and Google Assistant. \n\nIn addition, consider adding voice search to your mobile app. For instance, the app from global beauty retailer Sephora lets shoppers submit search queries by voice or barcode.\n\n10. Enhanced Focus on Mobile Shopping\n\nThe Pew Research Center reports that 76% of U.S. adults use smartphones for online purchases. Mobile phone shopping is highest among adults under 50 (91%).\n\nStay on top of this B2C ecommerce trend by optimizing your website for smartphones. Apply mobile SEO best practices including:\n\nResponsive design, which automatically adjusts your display correctly on mobile or desktop devices\nVoice search optimization, which makes it easy for customers to find items using voice search-friendly keywords\nTitle tags (between 50 and 60 characters) and meta descriptions (below 120 characters) that display fully in mobile search results\n\nConsider developing a dedicated mobile app to give shoppers more options. \n\nFor example, athletic apparel brand Lululemon has a mobile app that lets users customize and purchase items for delivery or in-store pickup.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse the Semrush Ecommerce Booster app to optimize Shopify stores for desktop and mobile users. You can improve your ecommerce product listings with the app's AI-powered product description generator and image upscaler.\n\n11. Mobile Wallets and Diverse Payment Methods\n\nAccepting credit and debit cards is the expected bare minimum for mobile commerce in 2024. Online businesses now offer a wider range of payment methods to meet consumer demand for convenience and security.\n\nLet’s take online retailer Overstock. Customers can choose from preferred methods including mobile wallets like Google Pay and Shop Pay. Or payment services like Venmo and PayPal. \n\nOverstock also supports Klarna, a service that allows customers to make flexible payments over time.\n\nMany ecommerce businesses also accept cryptocurrency. For example, Shopify merchants can allow customers to choose their preferred crypto payment method—like BitPay and Crypto.com.\n\n12. Subscription Services for Consumer Loyalty\n\nEcommerce subscription models turn one-time purchases into recurring sales. They increase revenue and customer lifetime value (CLV) while cultivating loyalty and ongoing convenience.\n\nThe subscription box industry continues to expand and influence shopping habits. Market research company IMARC projects a 14% growth rate between 2024 and 2032.\n\nIn the example below, Bouqs customers can buy any boxed flower bouquet as a one-time purchase. Or turn it into a subscription with monthly deliveries. \n\nSubscriptions to the floral brand include discounted pricing—to incentivize the initial purchase while enhancing CLV.\n\n13. Faster Delivery and Pickup Options\n\nOnline marketplace tools platform Jungle Scout found that 41% of consumers in 2021 expected to receive items bought online within two to three days.\n\nTwo to three days is still an acceptable delivery window as of 2023. But many shoppers want to receive their items much faster. \n\nAn OnTrac report shows that next-day delivery leads 74% of consumers to purchase. And same-day delivery drives 67% to buy.\n\nAim to offer next-day or same-day delivery to meet customer expectations. Consider adding an in-store pickup option if your business also has a brick-and-mortar facility.\n\nFor example, gaming retailer GameStop gives you three delivery options. Choose from standard one-to-three-day shipping, same-day delivery to select addresses, or same-day pickup at a physical store.\n\nThe GameStop website updates dynamically to reflect the number of items available at customers' preferred stores. It also shows how long customers have to place a same-day order for in-store pickup.\n\n14. Eco-Friendly Packaging and Practices\n\nSustainable ecommerce practices have become essential factors in consumers' purchasing decisions. NielsenIQ reports that 78% consider a sustainable lifestyle important. And 30% are more likely to buy eco-friendly items.\n\nAs an ecommerce retailer, you have several options for incorporating sustainable practices:\n\nUse eco-friendly packaging, including recycled materials\nOffer eco-friendly or carbon-neutral shipping options\nMake sustainability a core element of your company's mission and products\n\nFor Pact, sustainability is integral to virtually every element of the business. The ecommerce clothing company relies on organic farming, which Pact reports uses 81% less water and 62% less energy than conventional farming.\n\nThe company's products are all carbon neutral. It also uses recyclable paper bags to package products.\n\n15. Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Growth\n\nBrands that sell directly to consumers without involving a third-party wholesaler, distributor, or retailer now account for 17% of all U.S. online sales, KPMG reports.\n\nEcommerce brands benefit from this business model by saving on distribution and wholesale costs. They also have complete control over the entire business process—from manufacturing and marketing to sales and fulfillment.\n\nYou need a resilient logistics and fulfillment strategy to succeed with the DTC model. A dedicated employee or team for supply chain management can help you set up a reliable system and address potential challenges.\n\nYou'll also need to build a loyal customer base. \n\nLet’s consider apparel store Bombas as an example. The DTC brand's mission is to help people experiencing homelessness, donating an item for every piece of clothing bought.\n\nBombas continues to attract loyal customers who appreciate both its style and mission.\n\n16. Dedicated Options for B2B Ecommerce\n\nStatista projects that B2B ecommerce sales will grow from $2.3 trillion in 2024 to $3.1 trillion in 2027. \n\nMany B2C-leaning companies use separate B2B ecommerce platforms to attract customers and capture a portion of their revenue.\n\nDedicated B2B ecommerce websites use automation and AI to process orders, recommend repurchases at timed intervals, and invoice appropriate business units. \n\nAs a result, B2B customers can order items more efficiently, set up procurement workflows, and get expert advice.\n\nFurther reading: 18 Actionable B2B Ecommerce Best Practices\n\nTake Office supply company Staples’ three-tiered Business Advantage program for B2B customers. \n\nSmall businesses with up 20 staff get next-day delivery and access to expert assistance, while those that employ up to 500 people get flexible payment terms. \n\nLarger companies of 500+ workers can avail of eProcurement integrations and approval routing for more efficient purchasing.\n\n17. Prioritizing Privacy and Data Security\n\nBoth B2B and B2C ecommerce websites must prioritize data privacy in 2024 and beyond. Cisco reports that 86% of consumers care about data privacy, and 47% have switched companies over inadequate data policies.\n\nFor most ecommerce companies, tracking customers via cookies is no longer viable. \n\nGoogle Chrome intends to phase out third-party cookies by the end of 2024. And Statista indicates that only 25% of users have opted into mobile app tracking on iOS devices.\n\nOne of the most effective alternative ways to get to know customers is via zero-party data—information that your consumers willingly and voluntarily share with you.\n\nLet’s consider coffee roasters Counter Culture Coffee. Website visitors can take a quiz to discover their ideal coffee.\n\nThe quiz encourages—but doesn't require—visitors to share their email addresses. Using this zero-party data, the coffee company can build customer profiles for personalized marketing.\n\nNext Steps to Leverage B2C and B2B Ecommerce Trends\n\nKnowing how to start an ecommerce business is just the first step. To meet business goals and stay ahead of the competition, you should monitor emerging ecommerce trends and implement those most relevant to your business at the right time.\n\nAmong other things, Semrush can help you streamline your content and social media marketing efforts, improve your ecommerce SEO, and optimize your ad campaigns.
