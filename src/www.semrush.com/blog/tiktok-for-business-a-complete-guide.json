  "content": "TikTok's growth has been nothing short of incredible. According to Guinness World Records, TikTok is officially the fastest platform to accumulate a billion active users. A third of adults use TikTok in the US alone, and around 62% of adults 30 or younger are on the platform—with older adults representing a fast-growing segment of users.\n\nIn today’s digital landscape, businesses marketing to Gen Z or millennials can’t afford to skip out on TikTok’s potential. Even if your customer base skews older, TikTok's growing reach across age groups makes it a platform worth considering. But in light of the recent legal challenges and controversy surrounding TikTok, you might be wondering: Is investing in TikTok for business still a wise decision? \n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ll dive deep into why TikTok is worth your time—and how to use TikTok for business to supercharge your ROI. \n\nUnderstanding TikTok’s Culture\nWhat TikTok Can Do For Your Business\nDeveloping a TikTok Marketing Strategy\nCreating Engaging Content\nMeasuring Success: TikTok Analytics\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nUnderstanding TikTok’s Culture \n\nBefore we dive into using TikTok for business, let's take a quick tour of the current TikTok landscape—and how the platform has evolved. \n\nWhen TikTok first arrived in the US in 2018, it was primarily known for lighthearted content like music, dance, and lip-syncing videos. Today, it's a global powerhouse, home to a diverse range of short-form videos that inform, entertain, and inspire. The platform traces its roots back to Musical.ly, a social media app where users shared short clips of themselves lip-syncing to popular songs. While TikTok has expanded far beyond music-based content, Musical.ly's playful spirit continues to influence the platform's playful culture.\n\nToday’s TikTokers are highly engaged, spending an average of 90 minutes a day on the app. Music and sound remain central to TikTok's identity, playing a central role in who sees which content on their For You Page, and how likely they are to interact and engage with certain videos. As a result, many users discover new content, creators, and products through viral sounds and trending music. \n\nBut TikTok has become so much more than just entertainment. In 2023, over a third of American adults turned to TikTok for news and information, according to Pew. The platform now hosts a wealth of short-form videos covering virtually every topic imaginable, from political commentary to dating advice.\n\nTikTok is even changing how people search for information. In fact, Adobe found that 49% of millennials and a staggering 64% of Gen Z use TikTok as a search engine, with one in ten Gen Z users preferring it toGoogle. \n\nPopular TikTok searches include:\n\nLifestyle information (recipes, restaurant recommendations, DIY tips, fashion advice, etc.)\nHealth and fitness tips\nEntertainment recommendations (music, books, TV shows, movies)\nProduct reviews\nTravel inspiration\n\nTikTok also has its own unique social culture, with constantly evolving trends, memes, and slang terms. The term \"standing on business\", for example—which emphasizes authenticity, integrity, and focusing on one's goals in African American Vernacular English (AAVE)—has reached a global audience through TikTok. The more time you spend on TikTok, the more you'll notice these trends, phrases, and slang terms. \n\nIn a nutshell, TikTok today is fertile ground for new businesses looking to engage and grow their audience. If your product or service appeals to young adults, you likely have a ready-made audience on TikTok—and with careful planning and a well-crafted strategy, you’ll reach them!\n\n💡Pro tip: When a TikTok trend aligns with your brand, don't hesitate to join in! Remember the gummy bear concert trend set to Adele's \"Someone Like You\"? Even Lindt got in on the action with their chocolate bunny version.\n\nWhat TikTok Can Do For Your Business\n\nNow that we've explored TikTok's cultural landscape, let's get down to business: how can TikTok actually fuel your company's growth?\n\nWhile major global brands have been leveraging TikTok for business for years, smaller and medium-sized businesses often hesitate to invest time and resources into emerging platforms. However, TikTok's impact on businesses of all sizes is undeniable.\n\nIn 2023, TikTok partnered with Oxford Economics to measure the platform's impact on US businesses, including over 1,000 small businesses. The results were impressive:\n\nExpanded reach: Roughly two-thirds of small business managers surveyed reported reaching customers beyond their local area through TikTok.\nBusiness growth: More than half of TikTok users considered the platform valuable for expanding their business and customer base.\nIncreased sales: 69% of small business managers experienced a boost in sales thanks to their TikTok presence.\n\nIf you're in the ecommerce space, TikTok's Shopping and Showcase features offer even more opportunities. You can spotlight your products directly within your TikTok content, allowing customers to make purchases without ever leaving the app. But the benefits of TikTok extend beyond sales and reach, including boosted brand awareness, authentic engagement with your audience, and giving you a leg up on your competitors. \n\nTikTok is more than just a social media platform: it's a dynamic marketing tool that can transform your business. Whether you're a small business or a global brand, TikTok offers a unique opportunity to connect with your audience, drive sales, and build a thriving community.\n\n💡Pro tip: Lighthearted content can be a powerful tool for engagement and brand awareness. Duolingo's mascot-driven skits and slideshows are a hit with their audience, generating likes, shares, comments, and views.\n\nDeveloping a TikTok Marketing Strategy\n\nCreating a TikTok content marketing strategy follows the same principles as any successful social media marketing plan. It all begins with understanding your business goals. For example,\n\nAwareness: Do you want to reach new potential customers and establish brand recognition?\nLead generation: Is your goal to use TikTok to identify and nurture leads?\nSales: Do you want to sell products or services directly through TikTok? If so, are these impulse buys or do they require a longer sales cycle?\n\nOnce you've defined your objectives, you can tailor your strategy accordingly. For instance, if your goal is to drive sales, consider offering exclusive deals for TikTok users, creating a dedicated landing page, or implementing other promotional tactics to support your sales efforts.\n\nNext, identify your ideal customer or target market. Start by asking yourself the following:\n\nIs a significant portion of my target audience active on TikTok?\nWhat questions or pain points can I address through my content?\n\nWhile TikTok is most popular among younger adults, it's essential to understand the specific demographics and behaviors of your target audience on the platform. This will allow you to create content that resonates with them, encourages engagement, and ultimately increases your visibility.\n\nCrafting Your Content Strategy\n\nThe most effective TikTok for business strategies leverage the platform's unique features and culture. TikTok's algorithm quickly learns user preferences, serving up a personalized feed of content on the For You page. To succeed, your content must be engaging, relevant, and tailored to your target audience's interests.\n\nEmbrace the power of music, sound effects, and social trends in your TikTok videos. Authenticity and creativity are key to resonating with TikTok users, so let your brand's personality shine through.\n\nResearching Your Competition\n\nThorough research is essential for any successful marketing strategy. Analyze your competitors, non-competing brands in related industries, and influential figures in your field. Pay attention to:\n\nengagement levels and follower counts\ncontent types and audience response\nsuccessful strategies and tactics.\n\nBy studying the competition, you can quickly identify what resonates with your target audience. Use this knowledge to spark your creativity and produce unique videos that stand out from the crowd.\n\nSetting Up Your TikTok Business Account\n\nTo unlock TikTok's full marketing potential, you'll need a TikTok Business Account. You can convert an existing account or create a new profile. A business account provides access to valuable analytics, promotional opportunities such as advertising, and a suite of creator tools.\n\nCreating a TikTok Business Account is simple. Follow these steps:\n\nDownload the TikTok app.\nCreate an account on your desktop or mobile device.\nSwitch to a Pro Account through your profile settings.\nSelect the category that best aligns with your business.\nSwitch to a Business Account from the 'Manage account' section.\n\nIf you've converted a personal account to a business account and want to reverse it, you can easily unlink the business profile through your settings.\n\nOptimizing Your Profile and Bio\n\nYour TikTok profile is your brand's first impression. Make it count!\n\nUsername and nickname: Choose something short, memorable, and consistent with your business name or website.\nProfile picture: Use an eye-catching and recognizable photo or logo.\nBio: In 80 characters or less, briefly describe your business, your unique selling proposition, or the problem you solve. Keep it concise, engaging, and use emojis sparingly.\n\nWhile most accounts need to have 1,000 followers before they can add a clickable link to their bio, business accounts can list their website in their profile information, even with fewer followers. If you have fewer than 1,000 followers, TikTok may prompt you to register your business, providing you with a clickable link.\n\nLeveraging TikTok's Business-Friendly Features\n\nTikTok’s Business Center offers a suite of tools and features designed to help you succeed:\n\nCreator tools: Access scheduling tools, a commercial music library, and more.\nAnalytics: Gain insights into your audience and content performance.\nEngagement tools: Utilize auto-messaging and other features to connect with your audience.\nAdvertising: Create, purchase, and manage TikTok ads.\nWorking with TikTok's Algorithm\n\nTikTok's algorithm is a key driver of the platform's addictive nature. It quickly learns user preferences and serves up a tailored feed of content on the For You page. While some algorithmic factors are beyond your control, there are a few key SEO-style elements you can optimize, including:\n\nvideo titles\ncaptions and hashtags\nprofile bios\nposting schedules\nengagement with other profiles and comments\nparticipation in TikTok trends\n\nAccording to TikTok, the goal is to: “find balance between suggesting content that's relevant to you while also helping you find content and creators that encourage you to explore experiences you might not otherwise see.” \n\nWhen your audience watches and engages with your videos, TikTok's algorithm registers their interest and shows your content to more users with similar preferences. To that end, it’s important to create content with your ideal customer in mind!\n\n💡Pro tip: Your bio is your brand's elevator pitch on TikTok. Keep it concise, but don't be afraid to let your personality shine through. Crocs' bio is a perfect example, highlighting their unique selling point with a touch of humor.\n\n4. Creating Engaging TikTok Content\nCreating Engaging TikTok Content in Semrush's Social Poster\n\nThe type of content you create is crucial on TikTok. The platform thrives on creativity and authenticity, so don’t be afraid to use your imagination!

Choose your music and sound effects carefully, as they can significantly enhance your videos. While filming with your phone is perfectly acceptable, consider investing in a good microphone if you plan to include narration.\n\nDon't be afraid to experiment and let your brand's voice shine through. Even if you prefer a professional tone, your videos can still be casual, upbeat, and infused with your team's expertise.\n\nWhen shooting your videos, remember these tips:\n\nUse portrait orientation: This ensures your videos are correctly formatted for TikTok's vertical layout.\nFilm multiple versions: This gives you options to choose from and allows for A/B testing.\nKeep it short: Initially, aim for shorter videos to increase the likelihood of viewers watching them in their entirety.\n\nSuccess on TikTok comes down to understanding your audience, planning your content strategically, embracing creativity, and exploring collaborations. By following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to creating engaging content that drives real results for your business.\n\n💡Pro tip: Shareable content like tips, hacks, and recipes can boost engagement. Chipotle's menu hacks are a prime example, offering viewers quick and easy ways to elevate their dining experience.\n\n5. Scheduling TikTok Content\n\nDeveloping a regular cadence for posting content can feel overwhelming when you don’t know where to start. That’s where a content calendar comes in. A content calendar is an invaluable tool for streamlining your TikTok efforts, allowing you to plan your posts in advance and align them with key dates or events relevant to your business. Consistency is crucial on TikTok, so a schedule ensures you're posting regularly and maintaining audience engagement.

Measuring Success with TikTok Analytics\n\nTikTok Analytics is your secret weapon for maximizing your brand's impact on the platform. By diving into the data, you can fine-tune your content, engage more users, reach potential customers, and ultimately drive sales.\n\nTikTok's analytics suite focuses on three key areas:\n\nVideo performance: Track views, likes, comments, shares, and other metrics to gauge how your content is resonating with your audience.\nFollower demographics: Understand the age, gender, and location of your followers to tailor your content to their specific interests.\nEngagement indicators: Monitor likes, comments, and shares to identify which types of content spark the most interaction.\n\nBy closely monitoring these metrics, you'll gain valuable insights into what your audience finds most appealing. For example, if lighthearted videos featuring a company mascot consistently outperform other content, consider creating more of them. Look for opportunities to showcase your brand's unique personality and pay attention to how users respond. Don't forget to read the comments—your viewers might even tell you directly what they want to see!\n\nTikTok Analytics can also challenge your assumptions about your target audience. You might discover that your TikTok followers differ from your initial customer demographics. Embrace this new information and adapt your content strategy accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, TikTok Analytics reveals when your audience is most active on the platform. Posting during these peak times can significantly increase your content's visibility, leading to more views and engagement.\n\nIn essence, TikTok Analytics equips you with the data-driven insights you need to refine your marketing strategy, create content that truly resonates with your audience, and expand your TikTok presence.\n\n💡Pro tip: Even B2B brands can leverage humor while maintaining professionalism. Semrush's lighthearted jokes about marketers' daily struggles resonate with their target audience. Remember, TikTok's analytics can help you gauge what works best for your brand.\n\n6.
