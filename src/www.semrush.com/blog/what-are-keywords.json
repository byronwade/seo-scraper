  "content": "What Are Keywords?\n\nIn search engine marketing, keywords are terms you try to appear for in search engines like Google. So you can attract valuable traffic to your website or physical location.\n\nThis definition covers two categories:\n\nSEO keywords: Keywords you target through search engine optimization (SEO). This means you try to appear in the organic (unpaid) results.\nPPC keywords: Search terms you target through pay-per-click (PPC) search campaigns. This means you try to appear in the sponsored (paid) search results.\n\nFor example, a jeweler’s keywords might include “custom engagement rings.” Because it sells these products and wants to appear prominently when people search for them.\n\nLike these websites do:\n\nWhy Are Keywords Important?\n\nKeywords are important because search engines use them to find relevant content to show in search results. \n\nIf you use the term “custom engagement rings” appropriately on a webpage or in an ad campaign, a search engine is more likely to think it’s relevant. And rank it highly (position it high up on the page) when someone searches it.\n\nAnd that’s crucial. Because users are far more likely to click top-ranking content on search engine results pages (SERPs):\n\nPlus, keyword research (the process of finding and analyzing keywords) allows you to identify popular online search topics.\n\nThis means you can create content and ads that align with your target audience’s interests and needs.\n\nHow to Find Keywords\n\nIt’s possible to come up with keywords yourself. And get ideas from search engines or competitors’ websites. \n\nBut the best way to find keywords is by using keyword research tools.\n\nThese tools allow you to search keyword databases. So it’s quicker and easier to find relevant keywords to build content around. And harder to miss anything important.\n\nPlus, keyword research software typically provides access to useful metrics. So you can better gauge what content works best on your site.\n\nLet’s explore two of the most popular keyword research methods you can use.\n\nFurther reading: The Ultimate Keyword Research Checklist for 2024\n\nFind Keywords from Seed Keywords\n\nWith Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool, you can find relevant keywords by basing your search around a seed keyword—a broad term related to your niche.\n\nTo illustrate, let’s search “gold necklace” in our U.S. database.\n\nEnter the term in the tool. You can also add your domain to get personalized data if you wish.\n\nAnd click “Search.”\n\nBy default, you’ll get “Broad Match” results that contain any variation of your seed term. \n\nThis is generally the best way to ensure you don’t miss any relevant keywords.\n\nYou can get more specific results by looking at:\n\n“Phrase Match” keywords. Which contain your exact term with the words appearing in any order.\n“Exact Match” keywords. Which contain your exact term with the words in the order you specified.\n\nTo focus on keywords that trigger ads (not all keywords do), go to “Advanced filters” and select the drop-down under “SERP Features.”\n\nAnd add a filter for both:\n\nAds top: Keywords that trigger text ads at the top of the SERP\nAds bottom: Keywords that trigger text ads at the bottom of the SERP\n\nLater, we’ll explain how to use the metrics in the Keyword Magic Tool to choose the best keywords for your site’s search engine marketing (SEM) strategy.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nFind Keywords by Checking Your Competitors’ Keywords\n\nWith Semrush’s Keyword Gap, you can compare your keyword rankings against your competitors’ (i.e., conduct a keyword gap analysis).\n\nThis helps you discover relevant competitive keywords you might have otherwise missed. And gather useful insights into your market rivals’ search performance.\n\nSimply enter your domain and the domains of up to four competitors. And choose which type of keywords you’d like to focus on:\n\nOrganic keywords trigger a top-100 organic result for at least one of the analyzed sites\nPaid keywords trigger a search ad for at least one of the analyzed sites\n\nThen, choose your target country and click “Compare.”\n\nTip\n\nYour SERP rivals aren’t necessarily the same as your business rivals. Consider using the competitor domains suggested by the tool. Or check out our guide for help with identifying your online competitors. \n\nScroll down to the table to see a list of keyword ideas. \n\nWe recommend focusing on the following tabs:\n\nMissing: Keywords that all the rival domains rank for but you don’t. This suggests they’re highly relevant and you should consider targeting them.\nWeak: Keywords that all analyzed domains rank for but you rank lowest. Improving these rankings could help you gain more visibility over your rivals.\nStrong: Keywords that all analyzed domains rank for and you rank highest. Maintaining or improving these rankings can help you maintain a competitive edge.\nUntapped: Keywords you don’t rank for but at least one analyzed competitor does. This can help you identify keywords you’re missing out on.\nUnique: Keywords you rank for but your analyzed competitors don’t. This suggests they’re topics, products, or services you specialize in.\n\nIn the next section, we’ll explain how to understand the tool’s keyword metrics.\n\nTip\n\nFor more ways to find the right keywords, check out our guides on SEO keyword research and PPC keyword research.\n\nUnderstanding Keyword Metrics\n\nKeyword metrics are data points about particular keywords. They help you identify the best search marketing opportunities for your business.\n\nThe availability and accuracy of metrics depend on the keyword research tool(s) you’re working with.\n\nLet’s explore some of the most useful metrics and where you can find them.\n\nTip\n\nIf you can’t find the keyword metrics you need in the tool you’re using, try searching your keyword(s) in our Keyword Overview tool. It covers all the metrics in this list.\n\nSearch Intent\n\nSearch intent is the usual reason behind a user’s particular search.\n\nFor example, someone searching “lab created engagement rings” is typically shopping for engagement rings made with synthetic diamonds.\n\nAs the search results suggest:\n\nThere are four types of keywords when it comes to search intent:\n\nIntent Type\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nKeyword Example\n\n\n\n\nInformational\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to find information\n\n\t\n\n“how are diamonds made”\n\n\n\n\nNavigational\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to find a specific webpage or site\n\n\t\n\n“de beers diamonds”\n\n\n\n\nCommercial\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to research brands, products, or services \n\n\t\n\n“moissanite vs diamond”\n\n\n\n\nTransactional\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to take action (e.g., make a purchase)\n\n\t\n\n“diamond hoop earrings”\n\nSome keywords have mixed intent. Meaning significant portions of users want different things from the results.\n\nFor example, the SERP for “diamonds” contains informational pages like the one from Wikipedia. And transactional pages like the one from Diamonds Direct.\n\nYou can see keyword intent type(s) when you do keyword research in Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nYou can also visit the SERP for a more in-depth understanding. \n\nJust click the icon that looks like this:\n\nOr, click on a specific keyword to open it in Keyword Overview. Then click the “View SERP” link.\n\nNote\n\nThe search results you see in your own browser are personalized. When you view the SERP through Semrush, you get a better understanding of what the average user sees in your target location.\n\nSearch Volume\n\nSearch volume is the average number of monthly searches a keyword receives. So it gives you an idea of a high-ranking result’s potential reach.\n\nIn Semrush, you can see search volumes and how they’ve fluctuated over the previous year.\n\nFor example, Keyword Overview shows that “swimwear” gets 40.5K searches per month in the U.S. And that most searches occur around spring and summer.\n\nSo, an online swimwear retailer might want to plan a search advertising campaign well ahead of beach season. To capitalize on the potential to reach more audiences before they go on their summer vacations.\n\nKeyword Difficulty Score\n\nSemrush’s keyword difficulty score (KD%) measures how hard it’ll be to earn a top-10 organic search ranking. \n\nThis percentage metric is useful when choosing keywords for SEO. Because there’s little point in targeting keywords you’ll struggle to rank highly for.\n\nTo illustrate, let’s look at a couple of keyword examples we ran through Keyword Overview’s Bulk Analysis feature:\n\n“jewelry” has a 100% difficulty score. Which means the SERP is extremely competitive and most sites will struggle to rank on the first page.\n“star jewelry” has a 33% difficulty score. So even newly established sites stand a good chance of ranking if they create the right kind of content.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of all the possible keyword difficulty scores:\n\nPersonal Keyword Difficulty\n\nSemrush’s personal keyword difficulty (PKD%) score is an AI-driven insight that measures how difficult it’ll be for your specific domain to rank in the top 10 organic results for a given search term. It’s also expressed as a percentage.\n\nThis metric is calculated with our proprietary AI algorithm. And to determine ranking difficulty for your domain, it takes a look at:\n\nThematic relevance between the keyword and the domain you enter\nCompetition level for the topic you’re researching\nDomain metrics of your site and competitors present in search results\n\nFor example, the keyword “work management” has a KD% of 52% in Keyword Overview.\n\nBut for Monday.com, PKD% is 0%. Because the site’s content already has high topical authority in subjects related to the analyzed keyword.\n\nIf Monday.com wanted to rank for an unrelated term like “insulin,” it would have a difficult time. Because it isn’t relevant to the rest of their content.\n\nCost Per Click\n\nCost per click (CPC) is an important metric in PPC marketing because it's how much you pay each time someone clicks your ad.\n\nYou can get CPC estimates when you do keyword research in Semrush. \n\nFor example, “gold necklace” has an estimated CPC of $1.43 in Keyword Overview.\n\nAn ad’s CPC is determined by an auction between advertisers. While there are many factors that go into it, a higher CPC generally indicates that you can expect a higher conversion rate and/or a higher average order value.\n\n(Because advertisers are unlikely to pay for clicks that don’t generate a return.)\n\nBut what works for one business won’t necessarily work for another. That’s why it’s so important to monitor your PPC results and adapt your strategy accordingly.\n\nYou might also want to target high-CPC keywords through SEO. So you can attract valuable traffic in a more cost-effective way.\n\nCompetitive Density\n\nCompetitive density (Com.) is a Semrush metric that measures the level of competition for a paid search keyword in Google Ads.\n\nIt’s measured from 0-1 and can be seen in Keyword Overview. \n\nA score above 0.8 suggests that lots of advertisers are competing for the same spaces. To rank, you’ll probably need a high-quality ad campaign and a high budget.\n\nA score below 0.6 suggests that few advertisers are bidding on the keyword. This might just mean that the keyword is overlooked. But it could be that it doesn’t generate a good return on ad spend (ROAS).\n\nThe only way to know for sure is to run an ad campaign and measure your results.\n\nHow to Use Keywords in SEO\n\nIn this section, we’ll explain how and where to use SEO keywords on your website. So you can rank higher and get more organic traffic.\n\n1. Group Keywords into Topics and Pages\n\nTopic clusters are groups of thematically related pages that include a pillar (main) page and associated subpages. And creating them can help you build topical authority.\n\nEach topic cluster is made up of pages that contain keyword clusters—groups of keywords that share the same intent. So you can target all terms in the group through the same piece of content. \n\nThis is more efficient than targeting one keyword at once.\n\nAnd it helps you avoid keyword cannibalization—an SEO issue that occurs when multiple pages on a site satisfy the same search intent. Which also confuses search engines.\n\nYou can create clusters automatically with Semrush’s AI-powered Keyword Strategy Builder.\n\nEnter a few of the keywords you identified earlier and click “Create list.”\n\nThe tool will automatically generate both topic clusters and keyword clusters. \n\nHere’s what that looks like in our example:\n\nTo learn more about each topic cluster and keyword cluster, scroll down to the “Pages Details” section. \n\nIn the screen below, you can see a topic cluster centered around “gold chain bracelet” as the pillar page. And all its related subpages.\n\nYou’ll also see a breakdown of intent, keyword difficulty, and search volume for each page. Which can help you determine which topic clusters to prioritize over others.\n\nWe recommend that you use the keyword the tool shows as the pillar pages and subpages as your primary keywords for their corresponding pages. Meaning those should be the main keywords you want to rank for.\n\nAll the related keywords for each page (which you can view by clicking the arrow next to any pillar or subpage) become secondary keywords by extension. And you can use them to support the primary one.\n\nCreate Topic and Keyword Clusters\n\nwith Keyword Strategy Builder\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Create a Keyword Map\n\nA keyword map is a document that matches each of your keyword clusters with a target URL on your website. \n\nThe target URL is the page (or eventual page) on your site that should be optimized. Because it satisfies the cluster’s search intent.\n\nHere are a few examples to illustrate:\n\nPrimary Keyword\n\n\t\n\nTarget URL Slug\n\n\n\n\n“diamond rings”\n\n\t\n\n/rings/diamond/\n\n\n\n\n“lab grown diamond rings”\n\n\t\n\n/rings/diamond/lab-grown/\n\n\n\n\n“how to clean a diamond ring”\n\n\t\n\n/blog/how-to-clean-diamond-rings/\n\nOnce your map is complete, start working on the pages you identified as top priorities.\n\nNext, we’ll explain the on-page SEO techniques you can use to optimize your chosen pages for both search engines and people.\n\n3. Write Optimized Title Tags and H1 Tags\n\nSearch engines look at the title tag (the HTML page title) and the H1 tag (the main on-page heading) to understand what a page is about.\n\nSo, it’s important to include your primary keyword in both places in your HTML.\n\nLike this:\n\n<title>Diamond Rings</title>\n<h1>Diamond Rings</h1>\n\nTip\n\nAlways convert keywords into their correct grammatical form. For example, people might search for “engagement rings tiffany.” But you should use the term “Tiffany engagement rings” (or similar) in your content.\n\nSearch engines may also display your title tag (or a close variation) in the SERP.\n\nGoogle typically displays up to 60 characters in this spot:\n\nIt’s a good idea to include your primary keyword near the front to reduce the risk of it getting cut off.\n\nAnd make the most of any unused space by adding elements such as:\n\nYour brand name\nA call to action (e.g., “Shop Now”)\nA unique selling point (e.g., “Free Delivery”)\nSecondary keywords\n\nJust make sure to avoid unnaturally forcing in keywords. This is an issue called keyword stuffing, and Google may penalize you for it.\n\n4. Optimize Your Meta Descriptions\n\nYour meta description (HTML page summary) won’t directly affect your page’s rankings.\n\nBut search engines may display it in the SERP. \n\nIn this spot right here:\n\nSo, you should try to engage the searcher and encourage them to click on your result.\n\nOne way to do this is to include your primary keyword. And incorporate other relevant terms, if possible. \n\nThis will help signal to users that your result is relevant. Especially since Google bolds terms that correspond with the search query:\n\nTo increase the chance of your meta description being used in full, we recommend a length of around 105 characters.\n\n5. Add Secondary Keywords to Subheadings\n\nSubheadings allow you to break your content into sections. So, they’re often good places to include your secondary keywords.\n\nAnd if you use the correct heading tags (H2-H6), you’ll help search engines understand the structure and content of your page.\n\nFor example, you might have a heading structure that looks like this:\n\n<h1>Types of Gemstones</h1>\n<h2>Precious Gemstones</h2>\n<h3>Diamond</h3>\n<h3>Sapphire</h3>\n<h3>Ruby</h3>\n<h2>Semi-Precious Gemstones</h2>\n<h3>Amethyst</h3>\n<h3>Aquamarine</h3>\n<h3>Opal</h3>\n6. Naturally Incorporate Keywords in the Body Content\n\nWe recommend that you mention your primary keyword in the first paragraph of body content. To quickly establish what your content is about.\n\nAnd then incorporate all your keywords throughout the content where natural.\n\nRemember: \n\nKeyword stuffing can harm your SEO. And it’s likely to harm your conversion rates, too.\n\nFor inspiration, see how your top SERP competitors are using keywords.\n\nSemrush’s SEO Content Template tool makes it easy.\n\nJust enter your target keyword(s), choose your target audience, and click “Create content template.”\n\nThen, scroll down to see how your top 10 competitors use your target keywords.\n\nThe tool also provides a recommended word count, readability score, etc. Based on its analysis of the top-ranking content.\n\nWhen you’re ready to start writing, go to “Real-time Content Check” > “Open in SEO Writing Assistant.”\n\nSEO Writing Assistant is a Semrush tool that scores your content based on readability, keyword usage (SEO), tone of voice, and originality.\n\nIf you get stuck or want to save some time, you can use the built-in AI copywriting features to help you create your draft.\n\nWrite Keyword-Optimized Content\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign Up Now →\n7. Use Keywords in Your URLs\n\nIncluding keywords in each page’s URL (webpage address) helps search engines and users understand what they’re about.\n\nFor example, compare these fictional URLs for lab-grown diamond rings:\n\n✅ /rings/diamond/lab-grown/\n\n❌ /products/item/12345/view?category_id=789\n\nThe first is clearly more SEO- and user-friendly.\n\nTo optimize your URLs, you need to build a good website architecture. And use short, descriptive IDs for your folders, pages, etc.\n\nHow to Use Keywords in PPC Search Campaigns\n\nIn this section, we’ll share some tips for using PPC keywords effectively in your search ad campaigns. So you can achieve a higher return on ad spend (ROAS).\n\n1. Create Keyword Groups\n\nKeyword groups are sets of PPC keywords you target with the same ad campaign(s). Because users are looking for similar products or services.\n\nKeyword groups tend to be more efficient than targeting one keyword at a time.\n\nYou can organize your keywords into groups with the PPC Keyword Tool. \n\nDuring the setup process, import your keywords manually, from a file, or from a Semrush report. \n\nTip\n\nYou can send keywords to the PPC Keyword Tool from the Keyword Strategy Builder after you’ve set it up.\n \n\nAnd choose how to create your groups:\n\nCreate or select a group: Manually create a new group or choose an existing one\nAuto grouping: Automatically group keywords that share a root word or phrase\nCreate groups of 1 kw = 1 gr: Create single keyword ad groups (SKAGs)\n\nWhen setup is complete, click the “Recommendations” button in the upper right.\n\nFor each campaign, the tool may suggest:\n\nCleaning keywords (removing unnecessary elements from your keywords, such as punctuation)\nRemoving duplicate keywords\nAdding cross-group negatives (including negative keywords—which we’ll talk more about later—to prevent your ad groups from competing with one another)\n\nWhen you’re done, you can export your keyword data in a Google Ads-friendly format.\n\nOptimize Your PPC Keyword List\n\nwith the PPC Keyword Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Understand the Keyword Match Types\n\nIn Google Ads, the keyword match type you choose determines the scope of keywords that may trigger your ads.\n\nThere are three types:\n\nBroad match: Search queries that relate to your keyword may trigger your ad\nPhrase match: Search queries that include your keyword’s meaning may trigger your ad\nExact match: Search queries that match your keyword’s meaning may trigger your ad\n\nSo, choosing the right match type is key to maximizing your reach. While minimizing exposure on irrelevant SERPs.\n\n3. Use Negative Keywords Effectively\n\nNegative keywords are search terms that prevent your ads from showing.\n\nFor example, a jewelry retailer might want to add “tiffany” as a negative keyword. Because they don’t sell products from this brand and don’t want to pay for clicks from those SERPs.\n\nYou’ll need to choose match types for your negative keywords. But they work differently than normal:\n\nNegative broad match: Your ad won’t show if the query contains your keyword with the words in any order\nNegative phrase match: Your ad won’t show if the query contains your keyword with the words in the exact order you specified\nNegative exact match: Your ad won’t show if the query is exactly the same as your keyword\n4. Incorporate Keywords in Your Ad Copy and Landing Pages\n\nHow relevant your ad copy (the text that appears in your ad) and campaign landing page (the webpage that your ad links to) are to your chosen keywords plays a significant role in your ad rankings and performance.\n\nOne of the best ways to establish relevance is to incorporate your target keyword(s) in both your ads and landing pages.\n\nFor example, here’s a top-ranking ad for “lab grown diamond engagement rings”:\n\nAnd the corresponding landing page:\n\nTip\n\nFor advice on improving your landing pages, check out our content optimization guide.\n\nFor inspiration, you can look at your competitors’ ads and landing pages with the Ads History tool.\n\nEnter the PPC keyword you’re interested in, choose your target country, and click “Search.”\n\nThe blue boxes show each domain’s highest ad ranking by month.\n\nClick these boxes to see the corresponding ads. You can then click through to the campaign landing pages.\n\nView Ads from the Past Year\n\nwith the Ads History tool\n\nTry for Free →\nUse Your Keywords Strategically\n\nWith Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder, you can identify all the keywords you need to create pages and ads for in a matter of minutes.\n\nAnd Semrush’s other tools can help you with all the steps that come next.\n\nSign up for a free trial today.\n\nFind and Use Keywords\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\nKeyword Research Statistics \nOver 36% of SEOs say they spend most of their time on keyword research\nKeyword rankings are the third most important metric SEO professionals use to measure performance\nContent longer than 1,500 words published by the top 10% of websites ranks for a median number of 7 keywords\nAbout 4% of SEO professionals are looking to automate keyword research within the next year\nKeywords that are between 10-15 words in length get 1.76x more clicks than single-word terms",
