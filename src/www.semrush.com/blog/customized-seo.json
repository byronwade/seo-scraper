  "content": "If your business is already implementing SEO, that’s great. \n\nBut if you want to experience the full benefits of optimization, you need a customized SEO strategy for your business.\n\nThis guide shows you why a custom SEO strategy is essential for your business. It also gives you some actionable insights you can use to create your own strategy.\n\nWhat Is a Customized SEO Strategy?\n\nA customized SEO strategy is a tailored SEO approach specific to your business’s unique needs and objectives.\n\nThrough analysis of your goals, a custom SEO strategy maps out how your website can help you achieve them.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nBecause no two businesses are exactly alike. \n\nFor example, a service-based business has different goals than an ecommerce business (lead generation vs. driving sales).\n\nAn SEO strategy that’s customized to your business can help you:\n\nIncrease your credibility\nEstablish authority in your niche\nDrive relevant traffic to your site\nImprove your search engine rankings\nHow to Create a Custom SEO Strategy\n\nSo, how do you create a customized SEO strategy for your business?\n\nThere are a lot of steps involved, but we’ll break it down so you know exactly what to do. \n\nDefine Your Business Goals\n\nSMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) goals are measurable objectives that are highly relevant to your business.\n\nYou can use this framework to set SEO goals for your business, too.\n\nHowever:\n\nYou need to ensure that your business’s goals are realistic and achievable. And that you have the resources to achieve them. \n\nYou should also align your custom SEO efforts with your broader business objectives. This could include expanding into new markets and increasing brand awareness.\n\nFor example:\n\nYou could set a goal of generating 2,000 leads for your site in the next 18 months. Your custom SEO strategy may involve implementing more long-tail keywords into your website content. \n\nLong-tail keywords are highly targeted and tend to drive more conversions.\n\nAs another example:\n\nMaybe you set a goal of increasing the average session duration on your blog by 40% within a year. As part of your custom SEO strategy, you could focus on improving your content to increase engagement.\n\nFurther reading: SEO Leads: How to Get More SEO Clients\n\nEvaluate Your Competition\n\nUsing a platform like Semrush is an excellent way to keep tabs on your competitors’ custom SEO strategies. \n\nWith Semrush’s tools, you can analyze your competitors’ keywords, backlinks, and social media strategy. \n\nFor example:\n\nLet’s say you run a yoga blog. Your content will be competing with other yoga blogs in the space.\n\nUsing the Organic Research tool in Semrush, you can view your rivals’ best keywords, ranking changes, and estimated monthly traffic. \n\nSimply paste the domain you want to examine in the URL bar and click “Search:”\n\nThe Overview tab will show you that URL’s estimated monthly traffic, top keywords, keyword intent, SERP features, main competitors, and more.\n\nBrowse the top keywords to find which content angles your competitors are using and note the ones that overlap with your own personal business goals. \n\nYou also can identify gaps in your competitors’ strategies using a content gap analysis, then use your findings to make your own site more successful.\n\nFor example, you can find topics you’ve missed that your competitors have covered in detail using the Semrush Keyword Gap tool. \n\nWithin the Keyword Gap tool, you can enter up to five URLs (one being your own) to compare the shared keywords the sites rank for on the SERPs (search engine results pages). Click “Compare.”\n\nFrom here, you can view the “All keyword details for: [site]” section and select the “Missing” tab.\n\nThis will show you what keywords your competitors are ranking for that you are not.\n\nIf you see keywords that align with your specific goals, you can create content about these topics yourself.\n\nThis can increase organic traffic to your site. \n\nNote that your research shouldn’t just include content pages, however. \n\nYou should be analyzing your competitors’ money pages, too. How well are their landing pages optimized? How functional are they? \n\nThis can offer you valuable insight into how to optimize your own money pages.\n\nAnalyze Your Target Audience\n\nIt’s vital to know who your ideal customer is. \n\nCreating a buyer persona based on factors like age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors helps you customize your SEO campaign.\n\nIt allows you to work out your ideal customer’s pain points and how your business can solve them with products and services that resonate with your audience.\n\nBy understanding your customers, you can choose the right keywords to draw them in and identify which stage of the sales funnel they’re at.\n\nTo create a buyer persona, you can glean info from the following internal data sources:\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 (GA4)\nSocial media analytics \nCustomer relationship management (CRM) systems\nPast campaign performance metrics\n\nLet’s look at a simple example of a buyer persona: the Freelancer.\n\nThe Freelancer is a 28-year-old male who lives in California. He’s a freelance video editor who’s interested in tech. One of his pain points is finding a secure way to showcase his work to potential clients. \n\nEven such a basic profile gives you valuable information about the content, products, and services your target audience will be interested in. \n\nFor instance, the Freelancer is highly likely to be interested in the excellent security features of your product or services.\n\nSo, the content in your customized SEO strategy should speak to these needs, interests, and preferences. \n\nTargeting the right audience will then lead to improved conversion rates.\n\nAssess the State of Your Website\n\nSEO audits are important as they allow you to identify the current state of your website. \n\nThis includes analyzing your SEO performance and identifying areas that need to be customized to align with your objectives. \n\nConducting an SEO audit with a tool like Semrush’s Site Audit provides a picture of your site’s overall health.\n\nTo get started, enter your domain into the search bar and hit “Start Audit.”\n\nBased on the number of crawled pages, this process may take a while.\n\nOnce the audit has finished running, you’ll start at the main “Overview” dashboard.\n\nThis dashboard covers various aspects of SEO health, giving you a comprehensive overview of your site’s baseline. \n\nYou can click on any of the widgets to view more details of the audit. \n\nOn-Page SEO\n\nYour site's on-page SEO is crucial to your customized SEO strategy. It ensures optimization for both users and search engines. \n\nTo perfect your on-page SEO, you’ll need to do the following: \n\nConduct Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research forms an essential part of your customized SEO strategy. \n\nWhy?\n\nThrough this research, you’ll identify the words and phrases your target audience uses to search for services, products, and information relevant to your business. \n\nLet’s look at an example.\n\nSay you run an ecommerce store that sells handmade jewelry. \n\nInstead of focusing on broad terms like “jewelry” or “handmade accessories,” a custom SEO strategy emphasizes more specific long-tail keywords. \n\nThese keywords closely match the search intent of users and are farther down the sales funnel, closer to conversion intent.\n\nSo, you might instead target terms like “handcrafted silver necklaces” or “artisan gemstone earrings.”\n\nThis custom SEO strategy allows your business to align your content, product descriptions, and on-page optimization with the specific needs of your potential customers. \n\nYou can use tools like Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to conduct this research.\n\nTo use the Keyword Magic Tool, you first need to type in your seed keyword. Then, click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will show you a list of all the related terms.\n\nYou can select the different keyword groups at the left side of the page. For example, “silver.”\n\nFrom here, choose keywords to target from your selected group as part of your custom SEO campaign.\n\nFurther reading: How to Choose Keywords for SEO (A 5-Step Guide)\n\nWrite High-Quality Content\n\nA custom SEO strategy requires high-quality content tailored to your target audience's specific needs, interests, and pain points.\n\nA track record of producing high-quality content helps boost your rankings.\n\nSemrush’s Content Marketing Platform was designed to help you research, plan, and write optimized content that will perform well with audiences and on the SERPs.\n\nThe suite offers the following tools: Topic Research, SEO Content Templates, and SEO Writing Assistant. \n\nTo use the Topic Research tool, enter a topic you’re looking to generate content ideas about, and then click “Get content ideas:”\n\nYou can browse the Cards, Explorer, Overview, and Mind Map tabs to find relevant headline, subtopic, and question ideas related to your original query. \n\nTo turn your refined topic idea into a content brief, select SEO Content Template from the lefthand navigation bar under “Content Marketing.” \n\nType in your topic and click “Create content template.”\n\nFrom there, you will see your top 10 rivals and key content recommendations based on those rivals.\n\nFinally, the SEO Writing Assistant (SWA) is a smart writing and editing tool that will help optimize your content for engagement and SEO.\n\nTo get started, select SEO Writing Assistant from the lefthand navigation bar. Then, click “Analyze my text.”\n\nIn the editor window, begin writing your content. \n\nSWA will analyze the SEO potential and originality of your content in real-time.\n\nYou can use AI to compose or rewrite content using the Rephraser, Compose with AI, and Ask AI features.\n\nSWA will also gauge and score your content based on readability, SEO, and tone of voice, and originality, which allows you to make improvements where necessary. \n\nPrioritize Your Website’s User Experience (UX)\n\nA positive UX is important for all types of SEO, and custom SEO is no different. \n\nThis is because UX improves engagement and satisfaction while also potentially improving your rankings. \n\nA generic SEO strategy may prioritize general usability principles without considering the specific preferences and expectations of the target audience. \n\nCustom SEO takes an audience-centric approach to UX. \n\nThe focus is on understanding the target audience's specific needs, preferences, and behaviors. You must tailor your website’s design, navigation, and content to meet these specific requirements, resulting in a more personalized and relevant user experience. \n\nFor example, an ecommerce site’s custom strategy could involve including easy-to-use filters and sorting options. \n\nSee Wayfair for example:\n\nThis allows users to quickly narrow their search based on criteria—like price range and size—and find the products that suit their needs. \n\nOff-Page SEO\n\nWhile custom on-page SEO strategies are everything that happens on your website, off-page SEO involves efforts outside of your website.\n\nThis plays into building the authority and credibility of your site without actually doing anything to the site itself. \n\nHowever, much like on-page SEO, it's an important part of improving your site’s rankings and increasing its visibility. \n\nOn-page and off-page SEO work hand-in-hand to create the perfect recipe for success. To improve your off-page SEO, try the following: \n\nBuild High-Quality Backlinks\n\nA custom SEO strategy takes a more targeted, personalized, and relationship-focused approach to building backlinks. \n\nIt prioritizes high-quality backlinks from authoritative sources within your target industry. \n\nIt also focuses on leveraging content as a catalyst for earning natural backlinks and building relationships to secure ongoing link opportunities.\n\nSome ways to earn high-quality backlinks include:\n\nCreating useful, high-quality content\nGuest posting on other blogs\nResponding to HARO queries\nCreating linkable assets (studies, infographics, etc.)\n\nFurther reading: How to Get Backlinks: 10 Strategies That Work\n\nThe Semrush Backlink Analytics tool lets you review the number and quality of backlinks for your or a competitor’s URL.\n\nOpen the Backlinks Analytics tool, enter the URL, and click “Analyze.”\n\nThen, click the “Backlinks” tab to view a full list of source pages, anchor text, and an authority score (AS) for each source.\n\nWhile good backlinks can boost your website’s SEO, poor-quality or toxic backlinks can damage it. \n\nIf you’re concerned about toxic backlinks, you can use the Semrush Backlink Audit tool.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your URL, and click “Start Backlink Audit.” The audit may take a few minutes to run.\n\nFrom the audit dashboard, you can review the toxicity score of your URL. \n\nMove any toxic backlinks to a Remove or Disavow list. \n\nThen, you can send removal requests directly to domain owners right from the Remove tab with ready-made or customizable email templates.\n\nTo disavow backlinks, the tool will prepare a single file with all the backlinks you want to remove. You can upload this file to the Google Disavow Tool.\n\nFurther reading: Backlink Analysis: How to Spot Quality and Toxic Backlinks\n\nUtilize Online Directory Listings\n\nCustom SEO campaigns focus on identifying and utilizing niche-specific online directories. These cater specifically to your target audience or your industry. \n\nHaving listings in online directories is an important strategy in influencing your rankings for local SEO (more on that below).\n\nThese listings contain your business’s name, address, phone number, and web address. \n\nThey help both users and Google establish the legitimacy of your website and can lead to increased trust and traffic.\n\nMost online directories are free to use, and they help build authority while improving your local search rankings. \n\nYou can use Semrush’s Listing Management tool to check your directory listings and make sure they're properly optimized with up-to-date information.\n\nWithin the tool, you can enter your business name, phone number, website, or run an advanced search.\n\nThe tool allows you to add and update your business’s NAP (name, address, phone) information to various online directories. You can also see which directories have incomplete information:\n\nThe tool also lets you manage your business’s reputation by monitoring your ratings and reviews.\n\nTechnical SEO\n\nTechnical SEO forms another part of your comprehensive customized SEO strategy. Focusing on technical SEO will increase your site’s UX.\n\nYou can nail your technical SEO strategy by doing the following: \n\nImprove Site Load Speed\n\nWhen your website is as fast as possible, users are less likely to bounce quickly back to the SERPs and more likely to convert. Ideally, your page load speed should be 2.5 seconds or less.\n\nIn a custom SEO strategy, there may be a greater emphasis on optimizing the load speed of specific key pages or features (widgets, contact forms, etc.) crucial to achieving business objectives. \n\nThis could involve identifying high-priority landing pages, checkout processes, or interactive elements that require faster load times to maximize user engagement or conversions. \n\nResearch conducted by Google shows that bounce rates (the number of users who leave your site without interacting with it) go up by 90% when page load time increases from one second to five.\n\nThe same research demonstrates that bounce rates go up by 32% if page load time increases from one second to three. \n\nEnsure Your Website Is Mobile Friendly\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, 58.33% of global website traffic came from mobile devices. \n\nIf your website isn’t mobile-friendly, you're going to miss out on a lot of traffic.\n\nA customized SEO strategy allows you to prioritize the mobile-friendly elements most relevant to your business goals. \n\nFor instance, if you have an ecommerce store, you’ll want to ensure that you streamline your checkout processes for mobile devices.\n\nIf you have a physical store, you’ll want to focus on website features like click-to-call buttons. \n\nA mobile-friendly site enhances both user engagement and UX. Plus, conversions and sales can increase and your rankings should improve.\n\nAdd Schema Markup\n\nSchema markup is a type of microdata that provides context for search engines. It’s often also referred to as structured data. \n\nYou can customize your schema markup based on the needs of your customers. \n\nFor example, if you run a food and recipes site, you can use it to display star ratings for your recipes: \n\nSchema markup turns the elements on your website into a language understood by all major search engines. \n\nThen, search engines can provide users with richer, more informative search results.\n\nLocal SEO\n\nIf you’re a local business, or part of your activity is location-based, then your custom SEO strategy needs a strong focus on local SEO.\n\nLocal SEO differs from traditional SEO because it aims to improve your site’s visibility for local searches.\n\nFor example, let’s say you have a brick-and-mortar shoe store.\n\nWhen someone types in a search like “shoe shop near me,” you want your business details to appear in Google’s Map Pack as in the image below.\n\nThis can dramatically improve the visibility of your business for local searches, increasing traffic and ultimately leading to more conversions. \n\nFor brick-and-mortar stores, a local SEO strategy leads to more foot traffic.\n\nOptimize for Local Keywords\n\nAs part of your customized local SEO strategy, you should create content based on keywords related to the geographic location you’re targeting. \n\nThese could be phrases like “SEO services New York” or “best sushi in San Diego.”\n\nBy basing content on these keywords, you can show up for search queries related to products and services within a specific area.\n\nThis ensures that your custom strategy aligns with your business objectives. \n\nSet up Google Business Profile\n\nA customized local SEO strategy means creating a Google Business Profile that includes your business’s name, address, and contact details.\n\nTo make the most of your listing, you should also respond to customer reviews and keep your opening hours updated. \n\nFor example, Sam LaGrassa’s Google Business Profile includes its service options, address, opening hours, a link to its menu, and a phone number.\n\nYour custom SEO strategy could include incorporating local keywords into your Google Business Profile business description. This will improve your visibility in local search results. \n\nAs a hypothetical:\n\nIf you have a dental business in Austin, you could include keywords like “affordable dental services in Austin” in your profile. \n\nThis increases the likelihood of you appearing in local search results when users in your area search for dental services. \n\nThe Benefits of a Custom SEO Strategy\n\nNow that we’ve talked about the components of a customized SEO plan, let’s look at why you need one.\n\nStand Out from the Competition\n\nBy implementing a customized SEO strategy, your business can take advantage of your competitors’ shortcomings and go above and beyond what they’re offering.\n\nCustomized SEO goes further than simply optimizing your website for generic keywords related to your industry. \n\nIt involves identifying specific niches within your target market and creating tailored content that directly addresses those audiences’ unique needs and preferences.\n\nThis approach allows you to capture highly targeted traffic and position yourself as an expert, giving you a competitive edge in the market. \n\nImprove Search Engine Rankings\n\nCustomized SEO tailors your strategy by identifying relevant keywords, creating valuable content, and acquiring high-quality backlinks specific to your business’s goals.\n\nThis approach ensures your website ranks higher in SERPs, delivering targeted traffic and increased visibility to your target audience.\n\nImprove Your Authority and Credibility\n\nA custom SEO strategy helps you determine exactly what steps to take to improve your site’s authority and credibility. \n\nCustomized SEO analyzes your industry, competitors, and target audience to identify the specific steps required. \n\nThese steps aim to enhance your site’s reputation, build trust, and establish your brand as an authoritative source in your niche.\n\nIt ensures that your efforts focus on the most impactful actions for boosting your site’s credibility.\n\nIn SEO, authority refers to a website’s perceived expertise, trustworthiness, and credibility in the eyes of users and search engines.\n\nIt’s based on factors such as the age and history of the domain, the quality and relevance of its content, and the level of engagement and interaction from its audience. \n\nCredibility refers to how safe and trustworthy a site’s reputation is. \n\nWhen you create content full of expert knowledge relevant to your niche, you establish your site as a trusted and authoritative source. One of the best ways of achieving this is by adhering to Google’s Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) guidelines. \n\nWriting well-researched content with links to other credible sources helps to build your website's authority by showing you’re sourcing information from trusted sources. \n\nTarget Your Ideal Audience and Drive Relevant Website Traffic\n\nYou want website traffic to be relevant to your business, right?\n\nUsing a customized SEO strategy that’s tied to your business goals is the best way to achieve this.\n\nIt helps you target the right keywords and create content your target audience is looking for. \n\nAs a result, visitors to your site are more likely to stick around, interact with your content, and (hopefully) make a purchase, sign up for a newsletter, etc. \n\nTrack and Measure Your Results\n\nUsing a custom strategy makes it easier to track the KPIs (key performance indicators) that are important to your business. \n\nFor example:\n\nIf your main goal is to increase engagement with a specific audience, you can track metrics such as engagement rate and organic traffic volume for that audience.\n\nYou can then evaluate the success of your SEO efforts and identify which areas need improvement.\n\nThere are hundreds of KPIs that you could choose to monitor, so pay attention to those that are most relevant to your business goals and objectives.\n\nAs another example:\n\nIf you run a SaaS company, your custom SEO strategy can help you focus on metrics like free trial signups generated from organic search. \n\nYou can then optimize keywords and landing pages to increase conversion rates. \n\nOr, if you have an ecommerce store, you can pay close attention to abandoned cart rates. This allows you to focus on improving site usability and optimizing the checkout process. \n\nFurther reading: SEO Results: How to Track & Measure SEO Performance\n\nMaintain Brand Exposure\n\nCustom SEO strategies help users trust your brand and identify with it—as long as your content is valuable and credible.\n\nMaintaining brand exposure helps your business to stay top of mind for your customers. It makes them more likely to return to your site as a trusted source within your niche and to promote it to others.\n\nFor instance:\n\nIf you’re a travel blogger, a custom strategy aligns with your goals by attracting a global audience interested in travel. \n\nIt does this by targeting specific keywords related to travel destinations, tips, and experiences. \n\nYou can then create valuable content that establishes and maintains a strong brand identity. \n\nThis enhances your credibility among your target audience, leading to repeat visitors and more shareability. Which gives your brand continuous exposure. \n\nAttract Customers at Different Stages of the Sales Funnel\n\nTo ensure your conversion rates are as high as possible, you need to understand the different stages of the marketing funnel and how to use custom SEO to attract customers at each level.\n\nAwareness stage (top of the funnel, or ToFu): At this stage, users are looking for information to help them overcome problems they’re facing. Keyword analysis is very effective—you’ll often find queries revolving around questions like “how to,” “what is,” and more. \n\nBy focusing on keywords like these, your custom SEO efforts become more precise, making the right customers aware of your business.\n\nResearch stage (middle of the funnel, or MoFu): At this stage, users are interested in your product or service but will still research other options and compare different solutions. Your custom SEO strategy can provide users with in-depth comparison articles between different products. \n\nFor a tech company, this could be an article comparing Dell and HP laptops. This helps guide users in their decision-making process and increases the likelihood of your site attracting qualified leads. \n\nConversion (bottom of the funnel, or BoFu): As the user reaches the bottom of the funnel, your custom SEO strategy gives them the final push into converting. This involves convincing them to convert with optimized landing pages highlighting your business’s USPs (unique selling points).\n\nThese (often transactional) pages should reassure customers that they’re choosing the best option and reduce the barriers to purchase. \n\nFurther reading: ToFu, MoFu, BoFu: A Practical Guide to the Conversion Funnel\n\nReduce Marketing Costs\n\nInvesting in custom SEO services can lead to sustainable long-term success by increasing traffic and improving organic sales without spending money on advertising campaigns.\n\nCustomized SEO also reduces marketing costs, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.\n\nIncrease Your Conversion Rates\n\nA custom SEO strategy helps you attract users specifically interested in your products or services through personalized and targeted content. \n\nThis can lead to significant increases in your conversion rates. \n\nTechnical SEO tactics (such as improving website speed and ensuring mobile-friendliness) increase traffic and can boost conversions by facilitating a more effortless flow along the sales funnel. \n\nPlus, on-page custom SEO practices optimize your landing pages for your specific business and your target audience. \n\nThis alignment significantly increases the likelihood of conversions—users are more likely to convert when they land on precisely what they’re seeking. \n\nDevelop a Custom SEO Strategy for Higher Rankings\n\nEvery business needs a customized SEO strategy. Now, it’s time to start building your own.\n\nYou can sign up with Semrush to start analyzing the competition, creating a winning strategy, and climbing the SERPs.\n\nFAQs\nHow Do Online Reviews and Reputation Management Impact Customized SEO?\n\nOnline reviews benefit your customized SEO strategy by providing valuable user-generated content. \n\nYou can use the information you gather from reviews to gain a deeper understanding of your target audience’s preferences and pain points. \n\nThen, you can further customize your strategy to provide value to your potential customers. \n\nCan Customized SEO Help Local Service-Based Businesses Improve Their Online Visibility?\n\nYes, it certainly can. \n\nYour customized SEO strategy can involve creating location-specific content tailored to the needs and preferences of your audience. \n\nFor example, if you run a plumbing business in Seattle, you could create an article called “Common Plumbing Issues in Seattle.” \n\nThis content aligns with your specific goal of attracting relevant traffic to your site and improving your rankings in local search engine results. \n\nWhat Are Some Common Mistakes to Avoid When Implementing a Custom SEO Strategy?\n\nThis varies depending on the type of business you run and what your goals are. \n\nFor instance, failing to optimize product descriptions for your target audience is a common error in custom SEO strategies for ecommerce businesses. \n\nIf you run a digital marketing company, a common mistake to avoid is targeting too broad of an audience. Instead, you should target a specific niche based on your goals and optimize your site accordingly.",
