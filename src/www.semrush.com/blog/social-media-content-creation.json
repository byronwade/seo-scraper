  "content": "To reach your brand’s social media marketing goals, you need a plan. You have to create the right content for the right audience and post it on the right channels.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover everything from researching followers to choosing formats to writing social media copy. And we’ll recommend top tools for your social media content creation workflow.\n\nWhat Is Content Creation in Social Media?\n\nSocial media content creation is developing content to publish on social platforms. Common types of social media content include:\n\nText\nVideos\nImages\nLink posts\nLivestreams\n\nThe content creation process typically starts with researching the target audience and developing ideas. It usually ends with analyzing the results of the content you've published.\n\nWhether you're a content creator or you manage social media for a brand, it's worth investing time in creating relevant, high-quality content.\n\nGreat social media content helps you:\n\nBoost awareness of your brand, products, and services\nExpand your reach across social media platforms\nCultivate a community of loyal fans and customers\nDrive traffic to your website\nGenerate leads and convert customers\n8 Essential Steps for Social Media Content Creation\n1. Set Clear Goals\n\nStrong social media marketing goals define what you want to achieve and why. They help you understand what to publish, which speeds up your content creation process. And ensures you prioritize the right tasks.\n\nUse the SMART framework as a guide for your goals:\n\nSpecific: What exactly do you want to achieve and why? Provide as much detail as possible.\nMeasurable: How will you quantify or qualify the results? Identify the metric(s) you plan to use.\nActionable: What steps will you take to achieve the goal? Prioritize goals with realistic steps.\nRelevant: Is the goal related to your current scope of responsibilities? Focus on goals that matter.\nTime-bound: When do you need to achieve the goal? Set a deadline for yourself or your team.\n\nHere's an example of a SMART social media marketing goal focused on building brand awareness:\n\nOur team aims to get 10,000 YouTube video views (measurable) by July 31st (time-bound). To reach this goal, our team will create and publish one long-form video per week (actionable).\n\nBased on past performance, this number of video views will lead to at least 1,000 new YouTube subscribers (specific). Which will increase brand awareness as we expand to a new market (relevant).\n\nAnd a goal targeting website traffic might read like this:\n\nWe need to drive 5,000 clicks to the landing page (specific, measurable) within the first 24 hours of the marketing campaign (time-bound) to achieve our quarterly traffic goal (relevant). To do so, we will create and publish a Facebook post, an X post, and an Instagram story with a link to the page (actionable).\n\nWe will then retarget these website visitors by creating a remarketing audience. And guide potential customers toward making a purchase.\n\n2. Research Your Audience\n\nTo achieve your goals, you need to know how to connect with your audience. Research your followers to get social media content creation ideas.\n\nUse Semrush's Social Analytics tool to research Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn followers. On the main dashboard, select the social media profile you want to research. Or hit “+ Add profile” to add a new one.\n\nThen, make note of demographic data like your followers' age and gender.\n\nYou can also toggle between the \"Countries\" and \"Cities\" tabs to get more or less granular location data about your followers.\n\nFor more data on your target audience (but not necessarily your current social media followers), use Semrush's One2Target. You can find this tool under “Trends.”\n\nInput up to five of your closest competitors. After you enter the first, the tool will automatically suggest others. Click the \"Analyze\" button.\n\nThen, review the age ranges and gender breakdown for your competitors. To get a better sense of the demographics of the audience you're targeting.\n\nNavigate to the \"Socioeconomics\" tab to learn about your target audience's household size, income level, education level, and employment status.\n\nFor example, Patagonia’s largest audience segment includes households with three to four people. This Patagonia Facebook post appeals to this segment by featuring families enjoying the outdoors.\n\n3. Analyze Your Competitors\n\nOne way to get content ideas that resonate with your audience is to analyze the competition. Use Semrush's Social Tracker to see the social media campaigns competitors are running and find opportunities for your brand.\n\nScroll down to the \"Comparison With Competitors\" panel. Click \"+ Add competitor\" to choose more brands to compare.\n\nClick \"+ Add competitor,\" enter the brand’s name, and hit \"Add.\" The tool automatically identifies the brand's social profiles and adds them to the list.\n\nToggle between the \"Audience,\" \"Activity,\" and \"Engagement\" tabs on the \"Comparison With Competitors\" panel to see how your brand measures up.\n\nFor a platform-specific comparison, select one of the platform tabs. Then, choose which category to compare.\n\nFor example, when you opt to compare Facebook engagement, you can see the total engagement for your brand's Facebook profile. And how it compares to the competition.\n\nTo see what's driving engagement for your competitors, go to the \"Posts\" tab and sort by \"Engagement.\" Click any post to expand or view the original content to get ideas for your own brand.\n\nFor example, look for trends or memes your competitors are engaging with. If they’re relevant to your brand, consider adding them to your content plan.\n\n4. Choose Content Formats\n\nSelect the right format for your content. Use your goal to inform your choice.\n\nFor example, if you want to tell a complex story, consider using a short-form video.\n\nHere are some of the most popular social media content formats:\n\nText posts\n\nText posts work well when you want to tell a story, share a lesson, or ask a question. Like this beehiiv X post:\n\nBy asking this open-ended question, email newsletter platform beehiiv generated dozens of responses. \n\nImages\n\nImage posts are great for showcasing products or sharing lifestyle content. Like this Mokuyobi Instagram post:\n\nThe accessories company uses image posts to draw attention to its colorful products. And encourage customers to tap to browse the brand’s shop.\n\nMany platforms allow you to upload multiple images at once in a grid or carousel format.\n\nVideos\n\nVideos are ideal for sharing more complex ideas and thought leadership. They're also great for educating and entertaining viewers.\n\nLike this Red Bull YouTube video, which has generated over 1.5 million views:\n\nThe beverage brand regularly uses video to showcase extreme sports. And create a sense of adventure around its energy drinks.\n\nLink posts\n\nLink posts are best when you want to drive traffic to your website. Like this Semrush X post:\n\nFor example, Semrush shares link posts to point followers toward blog posts and other online resources.\n\nMany platforms allow you to add links within image and video posts as well.\n\nLivestreams\n\nLivestreams let you connect with your audience in real-time. They're great for demonstrating products, hosting panel discussions, and sharing expert insights.\n\nLike this Motion LinkedIn Live event:\n\nFor example, this Motion livestream is one in a series that shares expert tips with the company’s target audience: creatives and digital advertisers.\n\n5. Identify the Right Social Media Platforms\n\nTheoretically, you can create content for more than a dozen different social media networks. But it may be more effective for your overall social media strategy to focus on far fewer.\n\nTo find the right platforms for your brand, start with statistics. The Pew Research Center shares data on the percentage of adults who use each social platform based on age, gender, income, and other factors.\n\nFor example, Pew’s data shows that Facebook and YouTube are the most popular platforms for users aged 50 to 64. And X is most popular among college graduates and users with advanced degrees.\n\nAnother way to research the right platforms for your audience is by checking One2Target in Semrush. Click the \"Behavior\" tab to see the number of followers each competitor has on each platform.\n\nIn the example above, each competitor has particularly large audiences on both YouTube and Facebook.\n\nThe most popular social media platforms include:\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook is the largest social media network, with 3.05 billion monthly users. It attracts B2B and B2C brands alike. It supports everything from text and link posts to photo and video content.\n\nHere’s an example from Blue Bottle Coffee Facebook post, which uses text and images to announce a limited-time sale:\n\nInstagram\n\nAlthough Instagram started as a photo-based platform, it now supports short-form videos. And stories, which expire after 24 hours.\n\nInstagram is popular with both B2B and B2C brands. However, more B2C social media marketers consider it their most important platform, according to Statista.\n\nTake this Olipop Instagram story, which depicts the brand’s camp-themed influencer event:\n\nLinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is a professional networking platform ideal for B2B brands and working professionals. Businesses and employees can share text posts, events, and slideshows on this platform.\n\nLike this UserGems LinkedIn post, which shares slides with five tips for signal-based selling:\n\nPinterest\n\nKnown as a platform for shopping and learning new skills, Pinterest is popular with B2C brands. The platform has 518 million monthly active users.\n\nFor example, this ban.do pin links directly to the brand’s ecommerce store:\n\nX\n\nX is one of the smallest major platforms, with over 500 million monthly active users. But unique features for live events (Spaces) and long-form thoughts (articles and threads) make it popular with B2B and B2C users.\n\nFor example, this ColourPop Cosmetics X thread, which uses a thread to promote a product relaunch:\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube is a video platform for both long-form and short-form videos. It boasts 2.49 billion users, making it the second most popular social network worldwide. This channel is ideal for brands that invest in storytelling or that produce how-to content.\n\nLike Notion, which produces YouTube videos like the one below to show customers how to use the company’s productivity software:\n\n6. Write Engaging Copy\n\nNo matter which platforms you use or what type of content you create, you need engaging copy. Even when you post images and videos.\n\nSocial media copy is essential for sharing context and telling stories. In many cases, it also includes calls to action (CTAs), which prompt people to take the next step.\n\nUse these tips to write better copy for social media:\n\nStart with a hook. Grab your audience's attention from the very beginning. Start with a line that makes your audience want to read more. Avoid writing clickbait or misleading copy.\nDevelop post templates. While your copy should always be original, the format and style don't have to be. Use analytics to find what works best for your audience and turn top-performing posts into templates.\nTest different post lengths. Don’t assume your audience will always prefer shorter or longer posts. Instead, test different lengths to see what performs best.\nExperiment with CTAs. Calls to action don't always have to wait until the end of the post. Use CTAs with different wording throughout the post to prompt the next step.\n7. Develop a Content Calendar\n\nPut your social content strategy to work by mapping out a calendar for your posts. With a social media calendar, you can keep track of ideas, draft content, and schedule posts.\n\nUse Semrush's Social Poster tool to create a social media content calendar. Select the social profile you want to use. Then, click \"New post.\"\n\nWrite or copy and paste your caption. And upload an image or video.\n\nToggle the \"Post needs approval\" switch if you need to get another team member to approve the post. Then, opt to publish right away, save as a draft, or choose a time to schedule the social media post.\n\nWith Social Poster, you can also publish content regularly under the “Publish regularly” tab. For example, you can schedule the same post to publish once a week for a month. Specify the date range and publishing frequency. Then, click “Publish regularly.”\n\n8. Analyze and Optimize Your Social Media Content\n\nReview the content you've already published to optimize your social media marketing strategy. And continue to create even better social media posts.\n\nEnter Semrush's Social Analytics under the “Social Media” tab. Select the social profile you want to analyze. Then, choose the social network you want to review. Or click “+ Add profile” to connect a new one.\n\nGo to the \"Posts\" tab to analyze your content. The \"Top posts\" panel reveals your top-performing content. Use the posts to create templates for future ones.\n\nThe \"Posts that upset people\" panel shows posts that received negative feedback. Review them and read the comments to learn the reason. Then, make a note to avoid creating posts with these elements again.\n\nTools for Creating Social Media Content\n\nHere are some of the top content creation tools for social media.\n\nSemrush\n\nSemrush is an online marketing software platform with a social media management suite.
