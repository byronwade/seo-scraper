  "content": "You might already know that link building is huge for SEO. \n\nBut how do you actually get other sites to link to your amazing content? \n\nThe answer: link building outreach. \n\nLink building outreach is all about contacting the right people with the right message at the right time. \n\nAnd in this guide, you’ll learn exactly how to do that. \n\nWhat Is Link Building Outreach?\n\nLink building outreach is the process of contacting other sites or influencers and asking them to create links that point back to your own website.\n\nThe purpose is to increase your site’s visibility and credibility—which can help improve its rankings on search engines. \n\nBut getting links isn’t easy. You can't just spam people with random requests. You need to offer them something valuable in return.\n\nThat's where link building outreach comes in.\n\nLink building outreach involves finding relevant and authoritative websites, crafting personalized and persuasive messages, and building relationships with other webmasters.\n\nThe goal is to convince them that your content is worth linking to. And that linking to it will benefit them and their audience.\n\nTip\n\nNot sure who to reach out to? Use the Link Building Tool to find prospects and manage your link building campaign. \n\nWhy Is Link Building Outreach Important?\n\nLink building outreach is one of the most effective ways to boost your website’s visibility in search engine results.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause link building outreach helps you get high-quality backlinks from other relevant and authoritative sites in your niche.\n\nAnd backlinks are like votes of confidence for your website. They signal to search engines that your content is valuable, trustworthy, and relevant to your target audience.\n\nThe more high-quality backlinks you have, the higher your website will likely rank for your target keywords. \n\nAnd the higher you rank, the more organic traffic you typically get from search engines.\n\nThat’s why link building outreach is important. It’s not just about getting links. It’s about getting links that matter.\n\nHow Link Building Outreach Works\n\nSo, you know that link building outreach is all about getting other websites to link to your content.\n\nBut how do you actually do it?\n\nIt boils down to three main steps:\n\n1. Create High-Quality Content People Will Be Interested in\n\nThe first step is to create content that’s valuable, relevant, and engaging for your target audience.\n\nThis could be a blog post, a video, an infographic, a case study, a guide, or anything else that provides useful information. Or solves a problem.\n\nThe key is to make sure your content is:\n\nOriginal: Don’t copy or rehash what others have already said. Add your own insights, data, and perspective.\nComprehensive: Cover the topic in depth and don’t leave any gaps or questions unanswered\nActionable: Give your readers clear and specific steps they can take to apply what they’ve learned\nVisual: Use images, screenshots, charts, graphs, and other visual elements to make your content more appealing and easier to understand\n2. Identify Websites, Journalists, or Influencers Who May Want Your Content\n\nThe next step is to find potential link partners who are interested in your topic and have a similar or complementary audience to yours.\n\nThere are many ways to do this, but here are some of the most common:\n\nUse Google: Search for keywords related to your content and see which websites rank. You can also use advanced search operators like “inurl:,” “intitle:,” and “intext:” to narrow down your results.\nUse social media: Look for popular posts, hashtags, and accounts that are related to your content on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. See who’s sharing, commenting, and engaging with them.\nUse tools: Use tools like our Link Building Tool to find potential prospects you can reach out to. Or Backlink Analytics to see who’s linking to your competitors and which types of content tend to earn the most backlinks. \n3. Pitch Your Content in a Personalized Way\n\nThe final step is to contact your prospects and ask them to link to your content.\n\nBut don’t just send a generic email that says “Hey, I have this awesome content. Please link to it.”\n\nThat won’t work.\n\nYou need to:\n\nPersonalize: Address your prospect by name and mention something specific about their website, content, or profile that shows you did your research and aren’t spamming them.\nExplain: Express why your content is relevant, valuable, and useful for them and their audience. Highlight your content’s main benefits and features. And how it can help them achieve their goals or solve their problems.\nAsk: Ask for a link in a polite and friendly way. Don’t be pushy or demanding. Make it easy for them to say yes by providing a clear call to action (CTA) and a link to your content.\n\nHere’s an example of a good outreach email:\n\nSubject line: Loved your post on SEO trends for 2024\n\nHey David,\n\nI’m Carlos, a content marketer at Semrush.\n\nI just read your post on SEO trends for 2024 and really enjoyed it. You did a great job of covering the latest developments and best practices in the industry.\n\nI especially liked your point about voice search and how it’s changing the way people behave online.\n\nIn fact, I recently published a guide on how to optimize your site for voice search. And I think it’d be a great addition to your post.\n\nIt covers concepts like keyword research, content creation, schema markup, and technical SEO that can help you rank higher and get more traffic. All from voice search.\n\nYou can check it out here: [link to your content]\n\nI think it could provide a lot of value to your readers and help them get better results from voice search.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nCheers,\n\nCarlos\n\nP.S. I’m also a big fan of your podcast. Keep up the good work!\n\nAnd that’s it.\n\nFollow these steps, and you’ll be on your way to getting high-quality backlinks from authoritative and relevant sources.\n\nEffective Link Building Methods\n\nNow that you know what link outreach is and why it matters, let’s dive into some of the most effective tactics you can use to do it. \n\nTip\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along with the steps in this guide. \n\nThe Skyscraper Technique\n\nThe skyscraper technique is a tactic where you find the best piece of content on your topic, create something better, reach out to people who linked to the original, and ask for them to link to you instead.\n\nThis technique works because you’re not reinventing the wheel. You’re building on what’s already working. \n\nAnd you’re offering something valuable to the people who care about your topic.\n\nHere’s how to execute the skyscraper technique in three simple steps:\n\n1. Find a Popular Piece of Content on Your Topic\n\nThe first step is to find content that’s already attracted a lot of links from other sites. \n\nThis is your base for creating something better.\n\nOne way to do this is to enter a competitor’s domain into Backlink Analytics and head to the “Indexed Pages” tab. \n\nYou’ll see a list of your competitor’s pages sorted by the number of referring domains (i.e., websites linking to those pages). \n\nUse the external link icon to view the pages in a new tab. Do this for at least the top five.\n\nAnalyze them in more detail. And look at the format, style, and length. \n\nFor example: \n\nDo they use lots of visual assets?\nAre the formats more short-form or long-form?\nAre they how-to guides, listicles, templates, or something different?\n\nThen, click the number in the “Backlinks” column to see all the pages linking to that resource. \n\nThose are the prospects you’ll reach out to.\n\nDo this for several competitors. To compile a list of potential topics you can create pieces around. \n\nThen, choose one that matches your niche and audience. This is what you’re going to create content for to improve upon what your competitor created and outrank them. \n\n2. Create a Better Version of That Content\n\nThe second step is to create a better version of the content you found in step one.\n\nThis means providing more value, more depth, more insights, more examples, more visuals, and more up-to-date information than the original content.\n\nBut what does “better” mean?\n\nIt depends on the content type and format. But here are some general ways to make your content better:\n\nMake it longer and more comprehensive: Cover more angles and details. Provide more examples, case studies, and data. And include more images, videos, and infographics.\nMake it more current and relevant: Update any outdated information, statistics, or references. Add new trends, insights, and developments. And address any recent changes or challenges in the industry or niche.\nMake it more engaging and user-friendly: Write in a clear, concise, and conversational tone. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and lists to break up the text. Use transitions, hooks, and storytelling to keep the reader interested. And optimize your content for SEO and readability.\nMake it more actionable and practical: Provide clear and specific steps, tips, and advice. Include tools, resources, and templates that the reader can use. And show the results and benefits of reading your content.\n\nThe goal is to create a piece of content that’s so good, it makes the original piece look outdated, incomplete, or boring.\n\nTip\n\nUse the SEO Writing Assistant to check for SEO-friendliness, readability, tone of voice, originality, and more. \n\nFurther reading: What Is Quality Content & How to Create It\n\n3. Promote Your Content to the Right People\n\nThe third and final step is to promote your content to the sites that linked to the original piece. \n\nThese are your ideal link prospects. Because they’ve shown interest in your topic and are willing to link to similar content.\n\nHere’s how you can reach those prospects:\n\nAdd the URL of the original resource you chose to improve to Backlink Analytics and head to the “Backlinks” tab. \n\nYou’ll see all the pages that link to the resource.\n\nThen, open each page to see if you can find the author and their contact information. \n\nIf the page doesn’t list an author, try reaching out to someone on the editorial/content team.\n\nAnd know that there are tons of ways to find email addresses. \n\nFor example, you can use a prospecting tool like FindThatLead Domain Searcher to search a website, see who works there, and gather those employees’ email addresses. \n\nOnce you have the contact information for each page’s author, craft a personalized and compelling email—don’t use generic or spammy templates. \n\nWrite a short and friendly email that addresses the recipient by name, compliments their work, introduces your content, explains why your piece is better than the original piece they linked to, and asks for a link. \n\nFurther reading: Email Outreach: How to Write Outreach Emails that Convert\n\nThe Moving Man Technique \n\nThe moving man technique involves contacting sites linking to outdated content and requesting they link to you. \n\nThe key is finding outdated links on pages within your niche that have a quality backlink profile. \n\nTip\n\nYou can quickly check the quality of any website’s backlink profile by running it through Backlink Analytics and looking at the “Authority Score” widget. \n\n1. Locate Outdated Content\n\nFirst, find resources or sites that are outdated or inactive. \n\nLinks can often become obsolete due to: \n\nRebranding \nNew URLs \nDefunct services \nDefunct products \nLack of maintenance\n\nTo find these now outdated resources, you can use the following advanced search strings or search modifiers on Google:\n\n“service not available” + [industry keyword/article topic]\n“we have moved” + [industry keyword/article topic]\n“page no longer exists” + [industry keyword/article topic]\n“this website is no longer updated” + [industry keyword/article topic]\n“this page is no longer updated” + [industry keyword/article topic]\n\nFurther reading: How to Use Google Advanced Search Operators to Improve Your SEO\n\n2. Find Backlinks to Outdated Content\n\nOnce you have a list of outdated resources, use Backlink Analytics to find the pages linking to each of them. \n\n3. Create or Update Content\n\nCreate a new page or update an existing page with high-quality, helpful content. \n\nYou want your content to be as unique and engaging as possible.\n\nFor every link building technique, the resource you pitch needs to be excellent. Because you want people to want to link to it.\n\n4. Promote Your Content\n\nYour last step is to find the authors or site owners and promote your new, updated content. \n\nLet them know about their outdated link. And kindly pitch yours. \n\nGet Insights on Any Website’s Backlink Profile\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nGuest Posting\n\nGuest posting involves writing and publishing articles on other websites or blogs in exchange for a backlink to your own site.\n\nHere’s how you can start.\n\n1. Find Authoritative Blogs in Your Industry\n\nFirst, find high-performing or authoritative blogs in your industry that accept guest posts. \n\nOtherwise, you may be wasting your SEO outreach efforts. \n\nTo find these blogs, try using different search strings. Like these:\n\n“Guest author” + [industry keyword]\n“Guest post” + [industry keyword]\n\nThen, use Domain Overview to analyze each site. And pay special attention to the overall traffic, Authority Score (a metric that estimates how reputable a site is), and backlink profile.\n\n2. Request a Guest Post\n\nNext, you’ll need to contact these blogs in an approachable manner. Not all are equally as receptive to guest posting. \n\nIt might help to already have the article created. So they can review it while considering your pitch. \n\n3. Deliver Content with Links\n\nThe final step involves writing the guest post if you haven’t yet. \n\nYour guest content should be just as engaging, helpful, and accurate as the content you create for your own website. If not more so. \n\nThen, ensure that a backlink to your site with relevant anchor text is included in the article. This step is different for every prospect you contact, so make sure you follow their guidelines. \n\nFurther reading: How to Guest Post for SEO\n\nJournalism Sourcing Platforms\n\nJournalism sourcing platforms are online services that connect journalists (or other content creators) with experts like you. \n\nThey can be great ways to get high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites and publications.

Set Up Customized Alerts\n\nOnce you register with a journalism sourcing platform, set up alerts to get notified of relevant queries from journalists. \n\nDepending on the platform, you can customize your alerts by topic, keyword, industry, or publication.\n\nFor example, on Qwoted, you can select topics you’re able to speak to as an expert when setting up your profile. Which will send relevant media opportunities to you. \n\n3. Respond to Journalist Requests with Unique Content\n\nThe final step is to respond to journalist requests with unique and valuable content. \n\nThis is where you need to stand out from the crowd and show your expertise.\n\nHere are a few tips for a winning pitch:\n\nBe quick: Journalists often work on tight deadlines, so you need to respond as soon as possible\nBe relevant: Make sure your pitch matches the query and the journalist’s niche\nBe professional: Proofread your pitch for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors\nDigital PR\n\nDigital PR is a link building tactic that involves creating and promoting high-quality content about your brand or niche to relevant journalists and publications. \n\nThe goal is to earn editorial links from authoritative and trustworthy sources that can boost your site’s rankings and visibility.\n\nDigital PR content can include: \n\nOriginal, data-driven content promoted to journalists\nPress releases \nNewsjacking (writing about trending topics that are attracting a lot of attention)\n\nAmong other content types and approaches. \n\n1. Come Up with Ideas\n\nFirst, brainstorm ideas for your content that are newsworthy, interesting, and relevant to your niche. \n\nYou can use tools like Topic Research to find popular topics and questions in your industry. \n\nYou can also look for internal data, surveys, reports, or case studies that you can use to create original and compelling stories.\n\n2. Create Your Content\n\nThen, create your content based on the idea you chose.\n\nMake sure that your content is high quality, engaging, and informative. \n\nInclude a clear CTA and a link to a relevant page on your site. \n\nUse catchy headlines, visuals, facts, statistics, and quotes to make your content more appealing and credible. And use a friendly and conversational tone that matches your brand voice and audience.\n\n3. Build an Outreach List\n\nThe third step is to build a list of journalists, bloggers, and influencers who might be interested in covering your content. \n\nYou can use the Link Building Tool to find relevant prospects and their contact information. \n\nOr you can use social media, Google News, or online directories to find potential targets. \n\nWhichever method you choose, select outreach prospects based on their site’s Authority Score, traffic, topic relevance, audience size, and linking history.
