  "content": "In this post, you’ll learn exactly how to create and implement an effective SaaS SEO strategy—step by step.\n\nThis is the same strategy we’ve used to grow our own blog to over 1.5 million organic search visitors around the world per month.\n\nSo if you want to get higher Google rankings, you’ll love the actionable steps in this guide.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nWhat Is SaaS SEO?\n\nSaaS SEO is the process of optimizing your SaaS website to improve its visibility and rankings on search engines like Google and Bing. To attract more organic traffic, leads, and customers who are interested in the software solution your SaaS company offers. \n\nIt involves implementing different SEO techniques, such as keyword research, technical SEO (optimizing your site for search engines and the user experience), and link building (gaining links that point to your site)—and requires a SaaS-specific approach. \n\nFor both B2C and B2B SaaS, SEO efforts can help you:\n\nAttract potential customers\nBuild trust and authority\nImprove conversion rates\nReduce customer acquisition costs\n\nAnd more.\n\nWhy SEO Is Important for SaaS Businesses\n\nSEO helps you reach and attract potential customers looking for software solutions like yours. Whether you do it yourself or work with a SaaS SEO agency.\n\nCompared to most other types of businesses, SaaS companies rely more heavily on their websites to showcase their products, features, benefits, pricing, and testimonials. \n\nWhich means:\n\nHaving a high-ranking site that provides relevant and valuable information is crucial for generating leads, conversions, and revenue.\n\nHere are some of the main benefits of SEO for SaaS companies.\n\nScale Growth Exponentially\n\nSEO can drive consistent and qualified organic traffic to your site. \n\nOrganic traffic is traffic that comes from unpaid search results. And it’s valuable because it represents visits coming from people who are actively interested in the topics surrounding your business and offering.\n\nAs you create more content, your site ranks for more keywords. And you can attract more traffic from different regions, countries, and languages. \n\nWhich can help you expand your customer base and increase your global presence.\n\nImagine this at scale.\n\nThe more high-quality SEO content you create, the more traffic you'll likely drive. And this is exactly one of the techniques SaaS companies use for growth.\n\nReduce Customer Acquisition Costs\n\nSEO can reduce customer acquisition costs (CAC) and increase customer lifetime value (CLV). \n\nCAC is the money you spend to acquire a new customer. While CLV is the money you earn from a customer over their entire relationship with your business. \n\nAnd SEO is one of the most cost-effective ways to lower your CAC and increase your CLV.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause in pay-per-click (PPC) search campaigns like the one below, you pay for every single click to your website. Drive more clicks, pay more money. \n\nAnd with paid ads, traffic stops when you stop paying.\n\nSEO is quite the opposite. The cost per acquisition is initially high. But it continuously drops as growth compounds over time. Because the content you create can continue to rank and attract visitors for months or even years with very little additional investment.\n\nLet’s say you sell project management software to other companies. \n\nWith SEO, you could rank for keywords like:\n\n\"best project management software\"\n\"project management software for agencies\"\n\"how to manage multiple projects\"\n\nThese terms can represent different segments and stages of the buying process. And SEO allows you to capture them all, without paying anything aside from what it takes to create and maintain your content.\n\nEspecially for B2B SaaS, SEO’s cost efficiency can be huge. Because those companies tend to have higher acquisition costs than their B2C counterparts.\n\nFurther reading: The ROI of SEO: How to Measure SEO ROI (with Formulas)\n\nConvert Customers from Other Channels\n\nSEO can complement and enhance your other marketing channels. Such as social media, email, and paid ads.\n\nHow?\n\nIt can provide additional touchpoints and opportunities for prospects who already recognize you to interact with your brand. \n\nFor example, you can use SEO to drive traffic to high-converting pages focused on keywords your customers are likely to search after they’ve seen your Google ads and LinkedIn posts. And then use those pages to convert visitors into leads or customers.\n\nHow Is SaaS SEO Different from Traditional SEO?\n\nSEO for SaaS companies is different from regular SEO in two main ways:\n\nFirst, SaaS SEO is all about personas and problems. \n\nYou need to know who your target customers are, what they struggle with, and how your software can help them.\n\nSecond, SaaS (particularly B2B SaaS) SEO is often more about conversions than traffic. \n\nYou’re not selling a one-off product. You’re selling a long-term solution. So, you need to optimize your site and content for sign-ups—not just clicks.\n\nHow do you do that? \n\nBy using different types of content (like case studies, demos, and free trials) to show your prospects your software’s value and benefits. Across the entire customer life cycle. \n\nSaaS SEO and the Marketing Funnel\n\nIn SaaS SEO, it’s important to understand the different stages of the marketing funnel. And how to target the right keywords for each stage.\n\nThe marketing funnel is a model that describes the customer journey from awareness to purchase in three main phases. \n\nAnd if you align your SaaS SEO strategy with the marketing funnel, you can attract more qualified leads, nurture them with relevant content, and convert them into paying customers.\n\nLet’s look at the different types of keywords across the funnel. \n\nWe’ll use customer relationship management (CRM) software company Pipedrive as an example:\n\nNote\n\nWe used Organic Research to uncover all the keywords in this section.\n\nTop-of-the-Funnel Keywords for SaaS \n\nTop-of-the-funnel (ToFu) keywords are search queries people use when they’re looking for a solution to a problem or need. \n\nThey’re not necessarily aware of your product or brand, but they are interested in learning more about the topic. \n\nFor Pipedrive, a good example of some ToFu keywords they're ranking for are:\n\n“sales pipeline”\n“gross sales”\n“gross sales vs net sales”\n\nSomeone searching for these keywords isn’t looking for Pipedrive, specifically. But they’re likely working in sales and browsing for a solution Pipedrive offers. \n\nThe point of targeting ToFu keywords is to generate awareness and interest in your product category. And to educate prospects about the benefits of your solution. \n\nYou should create content that answers their questions, provides value, and builds trust. \n\nSome types of content that work well for ToFu keywords are:\n\nBlog posts\nEbooks\nGuides\nVideos\nMiddle-of-the-Funnel Keywords for SaaS\n\nMiddle-of-the-funnel (MoFu) keywords are search queries prospects use when they’re evaluating options and comparing features and benefits.\n\nThey’re aware a solution exists, but they aren’t ready to buy yet. They’re looking for more information and guidance to help them make a decision. \n\nFor Pipedrive, this means keywords like:\n\n“simple crm”\n“crm experience”\n“format of a business emails with an example”\n\nThe point of targeting MoFu keywords is to generate consideration for your product. And to persuade prospects that your solution is the best fit for their needs. \n\nYou should create content that showcases your product’s value proposition, differentiators, and success stories. \n\nSome types of content that work well for MoFu keywords include:\n\nCase studies\nTestimonials\nProduct features\nDemos\nBottom-of-the-Funnel Keywords for SaaS\n\nBottom-of-the-funnel (BoFu) keywords are search queries prospects use when they’re ready to buy or sign up for your product. \n\nThey know a solution exists, and they know who provides it. They just need a final push or incentive to take action. \n\nFor Pipedrive, this means focusing on keywords like:\n\n“pipedrive pricing”\n“pipedrive quickbooks integration” \n“pipedrive forms”\n\nThe point of targeting BoFu keywords is to generate conversions and sales for your product. And to overcome any objections or doubts your prospects might have.\n\nYou can create content that reinforces your product’s benefits, offers discounts or bonuses, and provides social proof and guarantees. \n\nSome types of content that work well for BoFu keywords are:\n\nLanding pages\nSales pages\nFAQs\nPiecing Together the Entire Marketing Funnel\n\nKeep in mind that there will always be people at different stages of the customer journey. And that the journey isn’t always linear. \n\nSome prospects might be in the BoFu stage, but then go back to some of your ToFu content to learn more about a high-level topic. Or be in the ToFu stage but ready to purchase soon after.\n\nThe key is creating content that connects these different stages. So prospects can move forward at their own pace. \n\nFor example, this article focused on “sales pipeline” covers the basics and establishes Pipedrive as an authority on the topic. \n\nWithin the article, they have internal links to other valuable content. And also include a form that allows users to download a guide in exchange for their contact information. To convert them into leads.\n\nThey also give a prominent spotlight to their own solution.\n\nFinally, interested readers who want to rapidly move through the funnel are just a click away from signing up for a free trial. \n\nBy strategically connecting your content across the funnel, you're better able to guide prospects toward becoming paying customers.\n\nFurther reading: ToFu, MoFu, BoFu: A Practical Guide to the Conversion Funnel\n\nA 9-Step Plan to Create Your SaaS SEO Strategy\n\nHere’s a step-by-step SaaS SEO strategy you can use to boost your organic traffic, leads, and conversions. \n\nTip\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along with the steps.\n\n1. Set Your Goals and KPIs\n\nSetting goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) is the most important part of any SEO strategy, SaaS or not. \n\nYou need to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve and how you’ll measure progress. \n\nFirst, your goals. \n\nGoals are the big-picture outcomes you want to achieve with SEO, such as:\n\nBoosting brand awareness and authority \nAttracting more qualified leads and customers\nLowering customer acquisition costs and increasing customer lifetime value\nEducating and engaging your target audience with valuable content\n\nKPIs are the specific metrics that show how well your SEO efforts are working. And how close you are to your goals.\n\nFor example:\n\nOrganic traffic: How many visits your site gets from search engines\nOrganic conversions: How many people take a desired action on your site. Like signing up for a free trial, requesting a demo, or subscribing to your newsletter.\nOrganic rankings: How high your website ranks in the search engine results pages (SERPs) for your target keywords\nOrganic click-through rate (CTR): The percentage of clicks on your site in the SERPs\nOrganic bounce rate: The percentage of visits that end without engaging with your content\nOrganic retention rate: The percentage of people who come back to your site after their first organic visit\nOrganic revenue: How much money your site generates from organic traffic\n\nThink about your business goals. And which KPIs can help show your progress. It’ll help you have a clear sense of direction and a way to measure success. \n\nFurther reading: SEO KPIs: 12 KPIs for SEO to Track & Measure\n\n2. Define Your Customer Personas\n\nThe next step in SaaS SEO is to figure out who your target audience is.\n\nAnd the best way to do that is to do research and create customer personas.\n\nCustomer personas are fictional characters that represent your ideal customers. And include details like:\n\nDemographics: age, gender, location, education, income, etc.\nPsychographics: interests, hobbies, values, attitudes, etc.\nBehaviors: online habits, search patterns, social media usage, etc.\nNeeds: problems, challenges, goals, desires, etc.\n\nAnd they’re important for SaaS SEO.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they allow you to understand who your target audience is, what they’re looking for, and how they make decisions. \n\nWhich helps you create content that matches their search intent (the purpose behind their query), solves their problems, and guides them through the buyer’s journey.\n\nStart by having a customer persona template you can fill out. Like this one:\n\nThen, use a tool like One2Target to learn more about your audience.\n\nAdd your domain and click “Analyze.”\n\nThe tool will provide four reports with information about your audience’s demographics, socioeconomic status, behaviors, and more. \n\nUse this data to segment your audience. Then, divide prospects into different groups based on their similarities and differences. \n\nFor example, you can segment them by location, industry, education level, budget, etc. Or a combination of characteristics.\n\nThen, create a different customer persona for each segment using the templates. \n\nFinally, validate and update your personas. Test them with real customers and prospects. And get feedback from your sales and customer service teams. \n\nAnd update your personas regularly to reflect any changes in your market and target customer behavior.\n\nGet In-Depth Audience Behavior Insights\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\n3. Find Your Competitors and Analyze Their Strategies\n\nOne of the best ways to improve your SaaS SEO performance is to learn from your competitors. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause they can show you what does and doesn’t work in your niche. So you can capitalize on their weaknesses and replicate their strengths. \n\nHere’s how to find and analyze your competitors:\n\nOpen Organic Research, enter your domain name, and click “Search.”\n\nThen, choose the “Competitors” tab to see a list of your top organic search competitors.\n\nClick on any competitor in the chart to learn more about their organic traffic trends, top keywords, top pages, and more. \n\nThen, find keywords your competitors rank for but you don’t. \n\nTo do this, use the Keyword Gap tool. \n\nEnter your domain and up to four competitors’ domains. Then, click “Compare.”\n\nScroll down to the table and select “Missing.” To show only keywords you don’t rank for but your competitors do. \n\nYou can also conduct a backlink gap analysis to find sites linking to your competitors but not to you. \n\nOpen the Backlink Gap tool, add your domain, add your competitor’s domains, and click “Find prospects.”\n\nThe table below shows the referring domains that send backlinks to the competitors you entered. \n\nYou can get more specific information about the links and URLs from each referring domain by clicking on the drop-down arrows.\n\nThis will show the domain’s Authority Score (a number out of 100 that indicates how reputable a site is), anchor text (the clickable text used for the link) and target URL, the date the backlink was first found, and more.\n\nLike this:\n\nNow, you have a list of sites you can reach out to for backlinks to your content (more on that later). \n\nAll of this probably sounds extensive. And it should be extensive.\n\nYou'll want to know as much as possible about what's driving your competitors' strategies. Then, you can feed this insight into your own roadmap.\n\nFurther reading: What Is a Competitor Analysis & How to Do It\n\n4. Build a Keyword List Around Pain Points\n\nOne of the secrets to SaaS SEO is to understand the problems or challenges your target personas have. And how your product can solve them. \n\nThat way, you can create content that attracts and educates potential customers at the top of the funnel.\n\nTop-of-the-funnel keywords are usually informational in nature. And often have high search volumes but low conversion rates. \n\nBut that’s OK. \n\nThe goal now is to bring people in to build awareness and trust with them. \n\nHere’s how you can start: \n\nBrainstorm the common questions, pain points, or goals your personas have related to your product or niche. \n\nFor example, if you offer a sales CRM software (like Pipedrive), you might think of questions like:\n\nHow do you build a sales pipeline?\nWhat is a sales funnel?\nHow do you measure and track a sales team’s performance?\n\nFor more ideas, use the Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nOpen the tool and enter a seed keyword from your niche. A seed keyword is a broad keyword you can use to find other keyword ideas. \n\nAnd you’ll get a table with tons of ideas based on the keyword you entered. \n\nThen, click the “Intent” drop-down menu and select “Informational.” \n\nThis will show only keywords with informational intent (when searchers want to find answers to questions). \n\nDo this for several seed keywords, and you’ll have a long list of ToFu keywords in no time. \n\nThen, you need to create content that provides value to your personas based on these keywords. And that positions your product as a potential solution. \n\nHere are some tips for creating top-of-the-funnel content for your SaaS company:\n\nUse the keywords in your content title, headings, URL, meta description, and body\nUse storytelling, data, statistics, and examples\nAdd clear and compelling calls to action (CTAs) that encourage your personas to take the next step\n\nTo streamline your content creation process and ensure it's optimized for both readers and search engines, use Semrush's SEO Writing Assistant tool. \n\nJust write (or copy and paste) your text in the editor. And the tool will assess your content in real-time for SEO, tone of voice, readability, and originality.\n\nIf you get stuck, use the AI-powered Smart Writer features to help reword sections, generate new content, or come up with ideas.\n\nOnce you’re done, you can move the article forward in your editing process. Or publish it directly to your WordPress site. \n\nBy creating content focused on your personas’ challenges like this, you can educate your potential customers and lead them to your product.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nKeyword Research for SEO: What It Is & How to Do It\nWhat Is Search Intent?

Find Keywords for High-Value Landing Pages\n\nAs you go down the sales funnel, you need to make sure you're targeting the right keywords for your commercial pages.\n\nYour commercial pages are your product and feature pages—those that provide insights into what your software offers.\n\nThink keywords like:\n\n“best sales crm”\n“crm experience”\n“free sales crm”\n“sales pipeline management tools”\n\nOnce you're ranking for these types of queries, you'll be able to drive more traffic that's closer to converting. \n\nThese searchers are actively looking for a solution like the one you offer. So, you need to make sure you're covering all bases and aren't missing out on terms your personas are searching.\n\nFind these keywords by using the “Intent” filter and selecting the box next to “Commercial” in the Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nThen, optimize your landing pages for these keywords. By using them in natural and relevant ways. \n\nFor example, include your keywords in your page title, meta description, headings, subheadings, body text, images, and calls to action. \n\nYou should also use synonyms, variations, and related keywords to avoid keyword stuffing (an outdated tactic meant to “trick” search engines) and improve relevance.\n\nThis is all easy to do with Semrush's On-Page SEO Checker. \n\nFollow the steps to configure the tool. And be sure to use the “Manually” tab on the “Add pages to optimize” screen. So you can make sure all your landing pages are included.\n\nClick “Collect ideas” when you’re done.\n\nOnce you run the tool, it will evaluate your content against your top competitors and give you an overview of how much your organic traffic could increase by implementing the suggestions.\n\nScroll down to “TOP pages to optimize” and click “# ideas” next to the first landing page you want to address.\n\nYou’ll then see a list of recommendations that can help your page perform better.\n\nFor example, it can help you:\n\nImprove readability: To make your content easier to read and understand for both users and search engineS\nEnhance semantic relevance: To enrich your content with related keywords and topics to include that can make your content more discoverable\nAvoid keyword stuffing: To ensure you're not overusing keywords, which can hurt your rankings and make your content less appealing to readers\nOptimize meta descriptions: To create meta descriptions that accurately reflect the content of your pages and entice searchers to click\n\nGet Optimization Ideas\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nSign Up Now →\n6. Build Out a Comparison Keyword Plan\n\nThe next step in your SaaS SEO strategy is to target comparison keywords. \n\nEssentially, \"[you] vs. [them]\" keywords.\n\nWhy?\n\nOnce your prospects get lower down in the sales funnel, there's a good chance they'll be comparing solutions. Hopefully, one of those solutions is yours.\n\nThese comparison keywords are important for a few reasons:\n\nPeople who search for these keywords are usually getting ready to buy—they just need a little push\nWriting content focused on them helps show how your product is different from (and better than) your competitors’ products \nThese terms often attract qualified traffic and leads—people who know you exist and are more likely to purchase\n\nFind these keywords with the Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nJust search for your product name, click the “Include keywords” filter, type “vs,” and click “Apply.”\n\nAnd you’ll get a filtered list like this:\n\nOnce you have a list of comparison keywords, create content for them. \n\nHere are some tips to do that:\n\nUse the keywords in your page title, meta description, headings and subheadings, body text, and images\nPresent the facts and features for both products without being overly promotional or negative\nUse a clear and consistent format (like a table, a list, or a chart) to compare the products\nClearly explain how your product can solve the user’s problem or meet their needs\nProvide a clear and compelling call to action, such as a free trial, a demo, or a discount\n\nHere's a great example from Pipedrive that compares Pipedrive vs. HubSpot:\n\nEven if these keywords have a low search volume, it's important to capture them. Because content geared toward lower-funnel searches can persuade users to convert. \n\nGet in there first before your competitors do. And if they're already targeting these queries, make sure your page is better.\n\n7. Create Better Content Than Your Competitors\n\nContent is the backbone of any SaaS growth strategy. It helps you rank for relevant keywords, attract qualified traffic, and convert visitors into customers.\n\nBut creating content isn’t enough. You also need to create better content than your competitors.\n\nFirst, you need to see what’s already working for them. \n\nOpen Organic Research, enter any competitor’s URL, and click “Search.” \n\nThen, head to the “Pages” tab. \n\nThese are all of your competitor’s pages sorted by traffic. Review the best-performing pages and look for patterns. \n\nFor example, consider:\n\nAre they mostly blog posts? Or something different?\nIs the content short-form or long?\nDo they use lots of videos?\n\nUse the answers to these questions to guide your content strategy. And replicate what’s already working in a better way. \n\nHere are some tips to help you create better content:\n\nWrite for humans. Write in a clear, conversational, and engaging tone. Use headings, bullets, images, and charts to break up your text and make it easy to scan. Avoid filler, jargon, and errors. \nDeliver value to your readers. Don’t just pitch your product. Solve your readers’ problems, and show them how you can help them. Provide practical tips, insights, examples, and case studies.\nOptimize your content for search engines. Use your target keywords and related terms in your content, but don’t overdo it. Use them naturally and in context. Include them in your title, headings, URL, meta description, and image alt text. \n\nFurther reading: Quality Content: What It Is + 10 Actionable Tips for Success\n\n8. Leverage On-Page & Technical SEO\n\nOn-page SEO (optimizing your webpages for users and search engines) and technical SEO make sure that your site is fast, secure, user-friendly, and easy to crawl.\n\nAnd they can make or break your success in SaaS SEO.\n\nThat’s why you need to optimize these key on-page and technical SEO factors:\n\nSite speed. Site speed is how fast your website loads on different devices and browsers. It affects your user experience, conversion rates, and rankings.\nMobile-friendliness. Mobile-friendliness is how well your site adapts to different screen sizes and orientations. Mobile SEO affects the user experience, conversion rates, and rankings. So, make sure your website is responsive, easy to navigate, and readable on mobile devices. \nHTTPS. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol that transfers data between your website and your visitors. It encrypts your data and protects it from hackers and eavesdroppers. And it affects user trust, conversion rates, and rankings. \nURL structure. URL structure is how your site’s pages are organized and named. And it’s a key factor for the user experience, crawlability, and rankings. Be sure that your URL structure is simple, descriptive, and consistent. \nMeta tags. Meta tags are snippets of code that provide information about your site’s pages to search engines and users. They also affect crawlability, click-through rates, and rankings. So, aim for meta tags that are relevant, unique, and optimized.\n\nTo check your site for these types of issues, use Site Audit. \n\nThe tool scans your site for 140+ technical and on-page SEO mistakes.
