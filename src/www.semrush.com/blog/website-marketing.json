  "content": "What Is Website Marketing?\n\nWebsite marketing is the promotion of a site to increase its traffic and awareness.\n\nStrategies to make this happen could involve SEO. Where you optimize your site’s content to increase its chances of ranking higher in search results. \n\nOr influencer marketing. Where you partner with relevant influencers to promote your website.\n\nRegardless of what strategy you choose to implement, the goal of website marketing is to drive targeted traffic to your site. \n\nWith more visitors, you can generate more leads. And ultimately more sales.\n\nHow to Build a Tailored Marketing Plan for Your Website\n\nA well-crafted marketing plan aligns your team and resource allocation.\n\nAnd by tailoring it to your specific goals and audience, you can ensure that every step contributes to success within your business. \n\nHere’s how:\n\n1. Define Your Objectives\n\nClear objectives give your website marketing plan direction. And they help you stay laser-focused.\n\nAsk yourself what you hope to achieve with your online presence. Do you want to increase traffic? To position yourself as an authority?\n\nList your objectives. And make them SMART (specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound).\n\nFor example, your objective might be to increase traffic by 25% by the end of the quarter.\n\n2. Identify Your Target Audience\n\nA clearly defined target audience makes it easier to market your website to the right people.\n\nThat’s because you’ll know what they struggle with. And what types of content you can create to ease those pain points.\n\nResearch demographic data to define your target audience. Such as:\n\nAge\nIncome\nGender\nMarital status\nOccupation\nLocation\n\nYou’ll also want to know psychographic information, which includes your audience’s:\n\nInterests\nHobbies\nValues and beliefs\nOpinions\nLifestyle\n\nSemrush’s One2Target tool shows you relevant information about your audience. Simply enter one (or more) of your competitors’ websites and click “Analyze.”\n\nClick into the four different reports along the top: “Demographics,” “Socioeconomics,” “Behavior,” and “Audience Overlap.”\n\nEach report provides key data and insights. For instance, the “Behavior” tab shows which social media platforms are the most popular with your target audience. So you know which ones to reach them on.\n\n Use the insights gained to build your website marketing plan.\n\n3. Evaluate Your Current Website\n\nWebsite errors may prevent people from converting on your site. Fix any issues to increase your chances of higher conversion rates through your website marketing efforts.\n\nStart by evaluating your website’s:\n\nDesign: Your site should look attractive, use quality visuals, and match your brand \nUsability: Make it easy to use (and navigate) so visitors can complete their goals. Whether that’s finding your contact information or buying a product. \nResponsiveness: A website should look great and function smoothly on all devices\nUser experience (UX): Ensure good UX across your site. Broken links or pages that return errors hurt the user experience. Run a site audit to spot any such issues. \n\nTo run an SEO-focused audit, go to Semrush’s Site Audit tool. Enter your domain and click “+ Create project.”\n\nEnter your domain and project name. Click “Create project”:\n\nThen head back to the Site Audit dashboard and select your project.\n\nNext, configure the basic settings. When ready, click the “Start Site Audit” button.\n\nTip\n\nUse our detailed setup guide to help you tailor the audit to your goals and needs. \n\nClick the “Issues” tab to find errors that are hurting your site’s UX and SEO.\n\nFix each error before implementing your website marketing strategy. To potentially give your site visitors a great experience with no roadblocks.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Outline Your Strategies and Tactics\n\nStrategies are overarching plans with broad objectives. Examples of strategies for website marketing include social media marketing and paid advertising.\n\nTactics are specific actions to accomplish smaller goals within your strategy. \n\nIn the case of social media marketing, a tactic could be to grow your Instagram account by posting Instagram Reels that promote your website. \n\nOutline your strategies and tactics to give you a concrete roadmap for your website marketing plan.\n\n9 Recommended Website Marketing Strategies \n\nWe’ll now go over nine different strategies to help you pick the right ones for your business.\n\n1. SEO\n\nSEO is a set of processes that aim to improve your visibility in search engines.\n\nWhen you rank highly or prominently on a search engine results page (SERP), you increase your online visibility. Which markets your site more effectively to drive more organic traffic and conversions.\n\nFor website marketing purposes, consider these four types of SEO:\n\nOn-page SEO\nOff-page SEO\nTechnical SEO\nLocal SEO\nOn-Page SEO\n\nOn-page SEO is when you optimize elements of your webpages—like your homepage or blog posts—to boost their ranking potential. And get more traffic that way.\n\nConsider the following optimization practices:\n\nAdd to your website content keywords (words and phrases people use to search for information online) you would like to rank for in search engines\nCreate a clear and unique title tag for each page\nInclude relevant and optimized internal links (links from your site that point to other pages on your site)\n\nUse the On Page SEO Checker to spot areas on your website that need improvement. Access the tool and click “+ Create project.”\n\nAdd your domain and give your project a name. Click “Create project.”\n\nNext, click the blue “Set up” button beside your website name.\n\nNow it’s time to configure your settings. \n\nTip\n\nUse our On Page SEO Checker configuration guide if you need help setting up your project. \n\nWith the On Page SEO Checker configured, click the “Optimization Ideas” tab followed by one of the blue “# ideas” buttons.\n\nEach row in the table below represents a specific page on your site. Sort them by “All Ideas” in descending order. You’ll see which pages have the most suggestions—and may need urgent attention.\n\nThe “Optimization Ideas” report also tells you how to improve each page’s on-page SEO. Along with helpful tips so you know what to do each step of the way.\n\nGo through each page and implement the suggested changes where appropriate.\n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\nOff-Page SEO\n\nOff-page SEO refers to factors outside of your website that influence its rankings. \n\nThese factors primarily include backlinks (links from external websites that point to yours).\n\nImproving off-page SEO can contribute to more traffic and aid your website marketing efforts. \n\nTechnical SEO\n\nTechnical SEO focuses on optimizing a website for search engines. It includes tactics like:\n\nOptimizing your website for mobile devices\nRemoving duplicate content\nEnsuring Google can crawl (access your web content) and index your website (storing your pages in its database). Making it more efficient for Google to rank your content in search results.\nAdding HTTPS so your website is secure\n\nAnd more.\n\nHaving good technical SEO on your site can improve its rankings. So you can get more traffic.\n\nThe Site Audit tool can evaluate your website (see step four above). It’s a straightforward and simple way to improve your technical SEO.\n\nFixing the flagged issues can improve your technical SEO performance.\n\nLocal SEO\n\nLocal SEO is about optimizing your online presence to improve visibility in local search results: Google Maps, SERPs for local search queries, and more.\n\nBy improving your local SEO, you can appear in the local pack (a Google feature that prominently displays businesses for a specific location): \n\nVisibility in Google’s local pack lets you promote your website to users in your target area.\n\nTo increase your chances of appearing in the local pack, create a Google Business Profile (GBP) for your business.\n\nGBPs look like this:\n\nThen, encourage customers to leave honest reviews. \n\nReviews can impact local rankings. And by ranking higher, you can continue to widely promote your website and win more traffic.\n\nNote\n\nLocal SEO is only relevant to your website if you are a local business or otherwise rely on local traffic (as opposed to traffic from anywhere or a very large geographical area).\n\n2. Web Content\n\nCreating content for your website—like blog posts and case studies—can drive traffic to your site. \n\nWhen people want to find something, like a specific product or answers to their questions, they often go on Google.\n\nAfter searching their query, they click on a webpage in the search results.\n\nThe higher you rank here, the more likely people are to click on your website listing. More than 68.7% of clicks go to the top three organic search results.\n\nTo rank well, write helpful, people-first content that gives information on topics your audience is interested in. Google will reward you for it.\n\nHere’s how to do it.\n\nFirst, find topics to write about. To get topic ideas, go to Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder and enter up to five seed keywords—broad terms related to your niche. We’ll use “website design for ecommerce” as an example.\n\nSelect a database (the country you’d like to gather keyword information for) and click “Create list.”\n\nThe following page displays your Topics and Pages broken into pillar pages and subtopics. \n\nIf you scroll down, you can see your pillar pages with lists of keyword clusters (groups of similar keywords) relevant to your content marketing needs:\n\nPick a subpage or cluster to write a blog post on and click the “Write content” button. \n\nChoose whether you want to target desktop or mobile searchers. (Search results can differ for desktop and mobile devices. Selecting a device gives you tailored writing recommendations.)\n\nThen, click “Send keywords.”\n\nThis opens the SEO Writing Assistant. Follow the recommendations provided here to help you write content that ranks.\n\nYou can copy and paste existing text or write new text directly in the SEO Writing Assistant’s editor. Right here:\n\nThe SEO Writing Assistant gives helpful suggestions to improve your content’s readability, SEO, originality, and tone of voice.\n\nGo through this process whenever you write a blog post to improve your chances of ranking highly in the search results.\n\nPublish quality content at a scale and frequency that is manageable for you. \n\nHere’s the key: \n\nThe more pages Google crawls and indexes from your site, the more opportunities for your content to appear in organic search results. But the content has to be good. Otherwise, it likely won’t rank at all.\n\n3. Organic Social Media Marketing\n\nOrganic social media marketing refers to unpaid methods of growing your social media accounts. \n\nThis means you don’t use ads. \n\nInstead, you create helpful content for your audience to gain followers and generate engagement naturally.\n\nShowing up frequently on social media lets you build brand awareness. And develop deep connections with those interested in your brand.\n\nIn turn, you’ll continue to increase your visibility. Which can help drive traffic to your website.\n\nHarness your social media presence to share useful tips and promote content from your website.\n\nLet’s say you own a yoga studio. You could post different yoga poses with tips on your socials. And direct followers to your website for more detailed information.\n\nImportant: \n\nRefer back to your target audience research to determine their favorite social media platforms. \n\nThen, create content at scale for each relevant platform with AI Social Content Generator. (Always thoroughly edit AI-generated content before publishing.)\n\nNext, you can schedule your content using Semrush’s Social Poster. \n\n4. Paid Advertising\n\nPaid ads put your website in front of specific people for a fee.\n\nThey’re ideal if you want to scale your business faster. And get more eyes on your website.\n\nWe suggest using two highly effective types of paid ads to market your website: social media and search engine ads.\n\nLet’s learn about each one.\n\nSocial Media Ads\n\nPaid ads on social media help you reach your ideal audience on different social platforms.\n\nWith social media ads, you can target people based on criteria like their demographics, interests, and behaviors. This way, you can reach a highly targeted audience relevant to your business or niche.\n\nUse social media ads to both grow your social following and effectively market your website in one swoop. \n\nHere’s an example of a website-linked Facebook ad from Mailchimp:\n\nClicking the “Learn more” button on the ad brings you to the website. Where you can sign up to receive the advertised report.\n\nSearch Engine Ads\n\nSearch engine ads—like Google Ads—appear above or below search results carrying the “Sponsored” label.\n\nPaying to appear prominently on the SERP can drive traffic back to certain pages on your website. Like your shop or specific product pages.\n\nBefore starting your first Google Ads campaign, head to the Advertising Research tool to see what ads your competitors are running.\n\nEnter your competitor’s homepage URL and click “Search.”\n\nThe report shows you essential information like how much traffic your competitors get from their ads. And the keywords they use.\n\nUse this information to generate ideas on which keywords to target.\n\nNext, click the “Ads Copies” tab to see your competitor’s live ads.\n\nReview their copy to inspire your own ad campaigns.\n\nUncover Your Competitors’ Search Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Email Marketing\n\nEmail marketing involves sending emails to people—known as subscribers—who have given you permission to do so. \n\nYou secure direct contact with your audience to be able to promote your website and products. Which increases your opportunities to drive purchases and repeat customers.\n\nFor example, you can email your subscribers links to newly published blog posts on your website. Or announce new products.\n\nGet started with email marketing by signing up with an email marketing platform like Mailchimp or ActiveCampaign. \n\nThese platforms let you collect email addresses and schedule emails to your recipients.\n\nCraft compelling messages to promote your website and offerings. Each email should have:\n\nAn enticing subject line: This short email “summary” is the first thing people read, so make sure it grabs their attention. Mailchimp indicates you should keep your subject line under nine words or 60 characters. Otherwise, it could get truncated (shortened) across different devices. \nValuable content: Pack your emails with useful and actionable information. Add eye-catching visuals and introduce white space where needed to make your emails easy to read.\nA strong call to action (CTA): Your CTA is what you want people to do after they read your email, like click a link to read your blog post. Or buy a product. Tell subscribers what next step to take with a strong CTA. Consider something like “Read the full blog post” or “Shop the sale.”\n6. Influencer Marketing\n\nCollaborating with influencers—social media personalities and bloggers—in your niche can expand your website’s reach to a new audience. \n\nYou can partner with an influencer and have them promote the products on your website. As in this promotional post on LinkedIn:\n\nOr get a blogger to write a post about your brand. Where they include a sponsored link to your website. \n\nReaders can then click the link to learn more about your business. Here’s an example of a sponsored blog post:\n\nWhen choosing influencers for your campaigns, make sure their audience aligns with yours. This gives you the best chance of advertising your website to interested people—in other words, qualified leads.\n\nInfluencer Analytics has a database of over 27+ million influencers. You can sort these influencers by different filters and keywords to find one that fits your needs.\n\n7. Affiliate Marketing\n\nIn affiliate marketing, you pay people a commission every time they refer a buyer to you.\n\nIt can be a hands-off way to market your website—specifically, products or services on your website. It’s also cost-effective since you don’t pay anyone until they bring you a sale.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nSay a blogger writes a review about your business. Their review includes an affiliate link (a URL with tracking information) to your website. \n\nWhen someone purchases through this link, you pay the blogger a flat fee or a predetermined percentage of the sale.\n\nYou can create unique affiliate links a few different ways:\n\nThrough plugins like AffiliateWP\nWith affiliate networks like ShareASale\nWith custom software built by a developer \n\nYou can also track purchases through coupon codes. Just like this post between an affiliate and Rogue Energy:\n\nThe key to successful affiliate marketing campaigns is to select affiliates who align with your target audience. \n\nAgain, Influencer Analytics will find you affiliates who fit your brand.\n\n8. Online Reviews\n\nOnline reviews and testimonials build credibility and social proof. They can be a vehicle to market your website, too.\n\nPeople often read reviews when they’re searching for a product or service. Like those on Facebook or Google.\n\nReading reviews helps consumers decide whether they want to do business with you. If they see good reviews, they’re more likely to click through to your website or buy your product.\n\nConsider setting up an email campaign that automatically asks people who have made a purchase to leave you an online review on Google or Facebook.\n\nOr reach out to customers and ask for a testimonial for your social media or website.\n\nMake sure to reply to those who leave reviews—even if they’re negative. According to ReviewTrackers, 45% of customers are more likely to visit a business that also responds to negative reviews.\n\nRun Semrush’s Review Management feature (part of our Listing Management tool) to keep track of and respond to Google reviews:\n\nTo start, head to Review Management and enter your business name in the search bar. \n\nScroll down to “Manage reputation & track competitors.” Here, you’ll see your average star rating and total number of reviews.\n\nClick “Manage reviews now” and sign up to access Semrush Local. Next, click the “Review Management” tab to see your reviews from various directories. \n\nYou can now respond to your Google reviews directly in the tool.\n\n9. Guest Blogging\n\nGuest blogging—publishing a blog post to another website in your niche—is an effective way to reach a wider audience with your website.\n\nAs a guest blogger, you’ll often receive an author bio with a link to your website. Some websites might also let you promote your content within the guest blog. Both can help you grow brand awareness and boost referral traffic to your site.\n\nHere’s an author bio on Forbes that includes a link to Tomoko Yokoi’s website:\n\nIt’s essential to find authoritative websites in your niche to ensure you target the right audience. \n\nPro tip: Search this query in Google to find websites to guest post on:\n\n“guest post” OR “guest column” OR “guest author” OR “become a contributor” OR “write for us” AND keyword\n\nGo through the search results to find websites that accept guest posts.\n\nNext, run Backlink Analytics to check if a website would be good to guest post on. Enter the site’s domain and click “Analyze.”\n\nPay attention to the “Authority Score” section.\n\nYou’ll learn if the site you’ve earmarked gets good organic traffic or if it’s spammy. Among other things.\n\nAvoid publishing guest posts on sites with signs of spam. It can hurt your website’s SEO (and damage your reputation).\n\nMetrics to Track Your Website Marketing Strategies\n\nTrack the right metrics to know how your website marketing strategy is performing.\n\nIt will help you spot areas that need improvement. And highlight what’s going well so you can keep up the good work.\n\nHere are four useful metrics to monitor the success of your website marketing strategies.\n\nNote\n\nYou can find the below metrics in Google Analytics 4. For further reading, read our guide to Google Analytics.\n\nConversion Rate\n\nYour conversion rate is the percentage of people who take a specific action on your website. \n\nThat could mean filling out a form. Or purchasing a product.\n\nA high conversion rate often proves that your website provides a good experience and attracts the right audience. A clear indication that your website marketing efforts are paying off.\n\nYou can monitor conversions in your Organic Traffic Insights report:\n\nLook at pages with lower-than-average conversion rates. Compare them with high-converting pages and try to pinpoint what they lack. \n\nFor example, maybe your low-converting pages don't have clear CTAs. And your visitors don’t know what they should do next.\n\nFix any low-converting pages to make the most of your website marketing efforts. \n\nNote\n\nFor this to be a useful metric to track website marketing efforts, you will need to set up conversions in Google Analytics.\n\nSessions\n\nA session is a metric that defines a group of activities a user performs on your site during a single visit. \n\nFor example, someone can land on your homepage, click to a blog post, then click to a product page before leaving. That’s one session.\n\nSomeone else might visit your homepage and then leave. That’s another session.\n\nAs you promote your website, you should notice an increase in sessions as more people click through to it. \n\nQuality sessions should convert into leads and sales. \n\nConfigure the Organic Traffic Insights tool to be able to view sessions for each page on your website.\n\nLook through the report and note if your website traffic is increasing or decreasing. You’re off to a good start if sessions are increasing. But you also want those sessions to be engaged, and, ultimately, to convert. \n\nEngagement Rate\n\nThe engagement rate is the percentage of engaged sessions. \n\nEngaged sessions in GA4 include those who spend more than 10 seconds on your website, have a conversion event, or show at least two page views or screen views.\n\nYou can also view engagement rate in the Organic Traffic Insights report:\n\nA high engagement rate can suggest you’re attracting the right audience to your site. And those people enjoy the content your site has to offer.\n\nHowever, a low engagement rate may mean you’re advertising to the wrong audience. Or that the UX on your website is poor, such as a confusing site navigation.\n\nLook through your website and try to address potential reasons for a low engagement rate. Then make adjustments until your engagement rate improves. \n\nTraffic Source\n\nIdentifying where your traffic comes from helps you evaluate the effectiveness of your website marketing strategies.\n\nSay you spend 50% of your time promoting your site on LinkedIn. But after reviewing your traffic source, you realize LinkedIn doesn’t bring in many visitors.\n\nYou might decide to shift your efforts to other social media platforms that drive more traffic. And yield more conversions that way.\n\nYou can find traffic sources in your web analytics software. \n\nFor Google Analytics, head to “Reports” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.” Select “Session source” from the drop-down menu.\n\nYou can also view the clicks you get from Google search results to your site in Google Search Console. This helps you track your SEO efforts.\n\nBuilding a Solid Marketing Strategy for Your Website\n\nYour website marketing strategy will have many moving parts.
