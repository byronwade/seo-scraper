  "content": "A Google Ads competitor analysis involves monitoring and evaluating the advertising campaigns of competing businesses in your industry. To learn about their tactics and get you ideas for your own campaigns.\n\nAnd it can focus on Google Search ads, Google Shopping ads, and ads on websites that partner with Google through the Display Network.\n\nWhy You Should Perform a Google Ads Competitor Analysis\n\nAnalyzing your competitors' Google Ads campaigns can help you find ways to boost your campaigns’ performance. \n\nFor example, if you discover competitors are bidding on keywords you're not targeting, you can add those terms to your campaigns. \n\nThis can help you capture potential customers you might have missed to drive more relevant traffic to your site, increase conversions, and more.\n\nPro tip\n\nOne way you can find these keywords is by using Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool and setting the keyword type in the setup screen to “Paid Keywords.” Try it for free.\n \n\nAnalyzing your competitor’s Google Ads also lets you:\n\nLearn what works and what doesn’t in their ads to avoid making similar mistakes\nCompare how much they spend on ads to help plan your advertising budget\nKeep up with changes in advertising trends \n\nNow, let’s go over how to do your first analysis. \n\nHow to Perform a Google Ads Competitor Analysis\n\nFollow these steps to analyze your competitors’ Google Ads:\n\nNote\n\nWhile there are multiple ad types you could evaluate, we’ll be focusing on search ads in the steps below.\n\n1. Identify Your Google Ads Competitors\n\nThe first step is figuring out which businesses are your top Google Ads competitors. \n\nUse the Advertising Research tool to do this.\n\nAdd your domain and click “Search.”\n\nFrom the \"Positions\" report, click the “Competitors” tab.\n\nScroll down to the “Paid Competitors” table to see your top search ad competitors based on the number of keywords their ads share with yours. \n\nThe more keywords you have in common, the higher the competition level.\n\n2. Find Your Competitors’ Paid Keywords\n\nNext, you’ll want to analyze the keywords your competitors bid on in Google Ads. To find additional relevant terms to use in your own campaigns.\n\nIf you’re just getting started and haven’t yet started running ads, return to the “Competitors” tab in the Advertising Research tool. And click any of the competitors’ URLs to go to the “Positions” tab for their domain.\n\nThen, look at:\n\nTheir ads’ positions in search results (the “Pos.” column)\nThe average number of searches each keyword gets every month (the “Volume” column)\nThe average cost per click (CPC) for those keywords—which is the average amount advertisers are willing to pay for a click on their ads\nThe estimated amount of traffic a given keyword drives to the domain being analyzed\n\nReview this list to look for valuable keywords. \n\nYou’ll want to choose keywords that align with your specific campaign plans. And ones that have attributes like:\n\nDecently high search volumes: Indicates many people search for it\nSpecificity: Suggests they’re long-tail keywords. Which are often less competitive but can lead to higher conversion rates.\nHigh traffic: Suggests the keyword is effective at driving traffic through ads\nLow CPC: Means a keyword is more affordable. What counts as “low” for you will largely depend on your budget and your industry.\n\nIf you already run ads, use the Keyword Gap tool to find keywords your competitors bid on that you don't.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your and your competitors' domains, and select the target country. Then, click \"Compare.\"\n\nYou'll see a report like the one below. Click “Paid keywords.”\n\nScroll down to the \"All keyword details for\" section. And click the \"Missing\" tab to see which keywords all of your competitors are ranking for but you’re not.\n\nIf you’ve entered more than one competitor, click the “Untapped” tab to see keywords for which you have no rankings but at least one of your competitors does.\n\nReview these keywords against the same criteria as before. Targeting those that are relevant to your business, have high search volume and traffic potential, and (ideally) a low CPC.\n\nFind Paid Keyword Opportunities\n\nwith the Keyword Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Review Rivals’ Ad Copy\n\nAnalyzing your competitors' ad copy shows how they try to appeal to potential customers. You can see the messaging, unique selling points, and calls to action (CTAs) they use to drive clicks.\n\nTo do this, head back to the Advertising Research tool. \n\nWith a competitor’s domain entered, navigate to the \"Ads Copies\" tab.\n\nYou'll see:\n\nThe exact ad copy they use\nLanding page URLs the ads link to\n\nClick the arrow next to \"Keywords\" on any of the cards to view all the keywords that trigger the ad. Along with specific metrics like average monthly searches, estimated cost per click, and your competitor’s ad position for each keyword.\n\nYou can use this data to identify even more keywords you might want to target. And see how your competitor incorporates them into their ad copy.\n\nTo analyze your competitor’s product listing ads, check out the PLA Copies report of PLA Research.\n\nOpen the tool, enter a competitor's domain, and select your target country. Then, click \"Search.\"\n\nYou’ll land on the “Positions” tab, which shows the products your competitor has PLAs for and how those ads rank in search results. \n\nHead to the “PLA Copies” tab to see your competitors’ best-performing ads.\n\nThis will show a grid of product listing ads, along with a keyword drop-down for each one. \n\nClicking one of these shows more data about the keywords that trigger that ad.\n\nAs you review your competitor's ad copy, pay attention to:\n\nThe key benefits they highlight\nEmotional triggers and pain points they mention\nPromotions like discounts or free shipping\nCalls to action that create urgency\n\nThe goal is to understand what motivates potential customers to click. And how your competitors are successfully gaining their attention.\n\nUse these insights to create ad copy that showcases your product as the ideal solution for the same needs.\n\n4. Track Competitors’ Campaign History\n\nAnalyzing your competitor's Google Ads history shows you how their strategy evolves over time. So you can learn from what has and hasn’t worked for them. \n\nWith a competitor’s domain entered, go to the “Ads History” tab in Advertising Research. This provides a 12-month view of your competitor's paid keywords and their positions.\n\nPay attention to keywords they consistently bid on and rank for each month—those are likely valuable terms. \n\nClick the blue cells to see how their ad copy changed over time. \n\nLook for messaging themes they stick with or offers they repeat. Those are likely driving strong results.\n\nUse these insights to identify your competitor's core terms and most effective hooks. And consider how you can apply these ideas to your own ads.\n\nAnalyze Your Competitors’ Ad History\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Review Corresponding Landing Pages\n\nYour competitors' ad landing pages show you how they attempt to convince visitors to take action. Which can help you understand what motivates your shared audience.\n\nTo find these landing pages, go to the \"Pages\" tab in the Advertising Research (when analyzing a competitor’s domain). \n\nYou'll see top landing pages associated with competitors' paid ads. Sorted by those that get the most traffic. \n\nClick the gray icon next to an individual URL to check out the landing pages.\n\nHere are a few elements to consider when looking at these landing pages:\n\nLayout and design: Look for simple, clean designs that help visitors easily find what they need\nHeadlines and copy: Check if the headlines are attention-grabbing and the copy is clear and benefit-driven\nCalls to action: Note the clarity and prominence of CTAs, and how they use action-oriented words to create urgency\nSocial proof: Look for the presence of testimonials, reviews, and trust badges that add credibility\nPage speed: Consider the general responsiveness and loading speed of the pages\n\nThe goal is to identify elements that make your competitor's page effective. And to adapt those elements to your own message and offering. To boost your conversion rate.\n\n6. Estimate Rivals’ Ad Expenses\n\nAnalyzing your competitors' Google Ads spending gives you an indication of how much advertising costs in your industry. This can help you set a realistic budget to stay competitive.\n\nTo see this data, jump back into the Advertising Research tool for one of your competitors. And head to the “Positions” tab.\n\nFirst, look at the \"Traffic Cost\" data at the top. This is an estimate of how much it would cost each month to rank for the keywords that appear in the report.\n\nYou can also see traffic cost stats for individual keywords. Just scroll down to the “Paid Search Positions” widget. And check the “Costs” and “Costs %” columns.\n\nThis shows approximately how much the competitor likely invested in each term over the past month. And what percentage of the total cost is attributed to individual keywords (higher percentages in the “Cost %” column can indicate which keywords are most valuable to that competitor). \n\nIf competitors are drastically outspending you on relevant terms, you may need to allocate more of your budget to maintain visibility.\n\nBut don’t just copy their spending. Because actual costs vary based on factors like ad relevance and targeting. And bigger budgets don't always mean better results.\n\nInstead, use these competitive insights as a starting point. And let them guide your budgeting decisions along with your own data on which keywords yield the best results.\n\nTools to Analyze Competitors’ Google Ads\n\nYou’ve already seen how some tools can be used to perform a Google Ads competitor analysis. But here’s a quick overview of some good options:\n\n1. Advertising Research\n\nSemrush’s Advertising Research tool shows which keywords your competitors bid on in Google Ads, the ad copy they use, how much they spend, and more. \n\nPlus, you can track their ad positions over time to gauge how their strategy evolves. \n\n2. Keyword Gap\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Gap shows you which keywords your competitors rank for that you don’t. And which keywords their ads rank higher for than yours (if you use the “Weak” tab).\n\n3. PLA Research\n\nPLA Research gives you an inside look at your competitors' Google Shopping campaigns—also known as product listing ads (PLAs).\n\nIt shows which products they advertise the most, how they price and promote items, and keywords that trigger their product listing ads.\n\nAnalyze Your Competitors’ Google Ads Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\n4. Google Search\n\nGoogle Search provides a basic method for manually researching your competitors' ads by entering target keywords.\n\nThis lets you view and analyze the ads displayed in the search results. And focus on elements like headlines, descriptions, calls to action, offers, and ad assets.\n\nThis manual approach works for a quick, surface-level check. But you need specialized tools for a more detailed competitive ad analysis.\n\n5. Google Ads Auction Insights\n\nThe Google Ads Auction Insights report shows how your ads perform compared to other advertisers participating in the same auctions. \n\nIt includes metrics like:\n\nImpression share: The percentage of impressions you (or a competitor) received out of the total you could have received\nOverlap rate: A measure of how often that competitor’s ads showed at the same time as yours \nTop of page rate: How often your ads (or your competitors ads) appeared at the top of the page above the organic (unpaid) search results\n\nBut know that you’ll only see data for keywords you’re already bidding on. And it’ll only show if your impression share is at least 10% for the selected time period.\n\n6. Google Ads Transparency Center\n\nGoogle’s Ads Transparency Center lets you view ads a specific advertiser has run across Google's network. \n\nYou can also see the geographic regions where the ads were displayed. And when they were last shown.\n\nBut it doesn't provide data on keywords, bids, or performance.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Ads to Improve Your Campaigns\n\nDoing a Google Ads competitive analysis isn't about copying your competitors. It’s about understanding their tactics to discover opportunities.\n\nCombine these insights with your own performance data, audience research, and business goals. To create an effective Google Ads strategy.\n\nGet started with Advertising Research to find your competitors, discover the keywords they're targeting, and learn from their ad campaigns.\n\nAnalyze Your Competitors’ Ads\n\nwith the Advertising Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
