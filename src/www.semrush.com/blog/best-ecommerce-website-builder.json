  "content": "Building a new ecommerce website doesn’t have to be a nerve-racking process.\n\nThere are plenty of ecommerce website builders to help you create one from scratch. But it’s important to pick the right one based on your specific needs. \n\nWe’ve researched the best ecommerce website builders—here are the top nine, along with our favorite features. \n\n1. Shopify\n\nShopify is a no-code website builder that allows you to seamlessly create an online storefront. Pair this with a custom domain and you’re on your way to establishing a recognizable brand.\n\nIt’s among the most popular website builders available. More than 1.75 million merchants and 3.76 million live websites currently use Shopify.\n\nShopify is versatile, offering thousands of themes and the ability to connect with over 8,000 apps. \n\nWhether you run a small startup or a large enterprise, Shopify has features designed to accommodate businesses of different sizes. \n\nShopify also provides other tools like centralized inventory tracking, built-in ecommerce SEO features, SSL certificates, email marketing tools, Shopify Shipping, and Shopify Payments.\n\nThese features make the platform user-friendly for both beginners and experienced ecommerce entrepreneurs.\n\nApart from the technicalities, Shopify places a strong emphasis on user experience (UX). The intuitive dashboard means even those with minimal tech knowledge can navigate, manage, and modify their online store without hassle.\n\nFor those who want to sell across platforms, Shopify’s omnichannel capabilities can easily sync your store with different marketplaces and social media sites. \n\nThe result? A unified and seamless shopping experience for your customers, regardless of where they shop.\n\nShopify doesn’t offer email hosting, so you need a third-party service provider to set up emails.\n\nThe platform also charges transaction fees for all payment gateways other than its own, which is an extra cost you must consider when budgeting.\n\nOur favorite features:\n\nLow barrier to entry: It’s quick, easy, and cheap to get started\nGood for dropshipping: You can streamline the dropshipping process for you and your customer, reducing hassle for you and improving customer experience\nWide selection of apps in its marketplace: Some of the features you could add include collecting and displaying external reviews, setting up a loyalty scheme, or improving your site’s search functionality\nSocial media selling: For example, you can connect your Facebook shop to your Shopify store. Any changes you make in Shopify automatically reflect in Facebook, too.\n\nInterested in trying out the tool before committing to the fees? Shopify and Semrush offer a bundle, so you can try both tools free for 14 days. \n\n2. Wix\n\nWix is a great choice for those looking to get started with an ecommerce website. Its easy-to-use drag-and-drop website builder allows you to create complete online stores. \n\nWix also offers product categorization, discount promotions, payment processing, and customer reviews. \n\nAnd with its vast library of pre-made templates, you can create a website that reflects your brand’s unique voice and style. \n\nWix only provides 500 MB of storage on its free plan, so you’ll need to upgrade to the paid version if you upload a lot of product images or videos.\n\nWix is also a closed platform, so it might be challenging to integrate your store with third-party services like email marketing or analytics tools. \n\nIt does come equipped with plenty of extras, though.\n\nYou can expand your ecommerce business with advanced features like abandoned cart emails, inventory tracking, customer segmentation, and over 50 payment methods. \n\nOn top of that, Wix supports a variety of customized business models. Whether you’re dropshipping or creating exclusive content subscriptions, Wix can help your ecommerce business succeed.\n\nPricing for Wix starts at $16 a month. \n\nOur favorite features:\n\nEasy and intuitive to use: Wix’s drag-and-drop interface gives it a low barrier to entry. It’s easy to create a functional website.\nWix Editor: To help to include eye-catching imagery on your site, Wix has a built-in image library. This includes high-quality images, videos, vectors, and shapes.\n3. Squarespace\n\nSquarespace is a holistic website-building platform catering to upstarts and established brands. \n\nIts design gives users a palette of attractive and responsive templates suitable for any niche or industry. \n\nA user-friendly drag-and-drop interface supports these layouts and ensures a smooth building experience, even for the non-tech savvy. \n\nPlus, these templates are mobile-optimized out of the box. That ensures a consistent and engaging user experience across devices.\n\nSquarespace also enhances your online visibility. Its integrated SEO tools and blogging capabilities make it simple to rank on search engines and connect with your audience. \n\nThe platform also offers streamlined inventory management, various payment gateways, and tools to provide a seamless shopping journey for customers.\n\nCustomization options on these templates are limited, though—so they might not suit you if you want to make significant changes.\n\nAlso note that Squarespace doesn’t have a dedicated app store like Shopify or WordPress. Keep that in mind if you need integrations.\n\nPricing plans for Squarespace start at $23 monthly. \n\nOur favorite features:\n\nMobile-friendliness: Squarespace makes it easy to create a user-friendly, responsive website\nAttractive design: Squarespace is known for helping people create attractive websites. It has a wide range of templates for you to choose from.\nGreat support: You can get support from their in-depth FAQs. Or if you need something more specific, via live chat or email.\n4. BigCommerce\n\nBigCommerce is an all-in-one ecommerce platform with omnichannel capabilities designed to power high-growth online stores. \n\nIts architecture can handle high traffic and sales volumes without compromising site speed or performance. Unlimited storage plans and user accounts also make it easy to manage your store.\n\nWith integrations using tools like Feedonomics and Codisto, you can sell, advertise, and expand your presence across digital marketplaces, social commerce platforms, and search engines. \n\nThe advanced FeedAi™ and FeedDNA™ features also allow you to categorize product listings automatically and optimize performance across channels. \n\nOpen API architecture, multi-storefront capabilities, and a growing set of pre-integrated apps make BigCommerce a great choice for high-growth ecommerce businesses.\n\nThe platform’s extensive features can sometimes overwhelm users new to ecommerce, though. \n\nThere’s a steeper learning curve compared to simpler website builders, so you may need to spend time playing around with it.\n\nOur favorite features:\n\nGreat for time-saving: Its AI features and integrations mean that it can save you time with admin and store maintenance\nMore standard features: Potentially leading to cost savings, especially for larger stores\nGreat for SEO: Giving your products the chance to rank higher in search engines and reach more potential customers\n\nEach pricing plan comes with an annual sales threshold.

You can customize your store with free or paid themes, multiple languages, currency options, and coupons.\n\nPlus, thousands of plugins are available to add all sorts of features to your WooCommerce store. \n\nWooCommerce also supports over 70 payment gateways, including PayPal, Stripe, and Klarna. \n\nRegular updates, compatibility with SSL, and a range of plugins make WooCommerce a secure choice. \n\nUnlike hosted ecommerce solutions, businesses using WooCommerce need to handle hosting and security measures.

It takes some time to familiarize yourself with all the functionalities.\n\nBut where Shift4Shop stands out is its features for B2B ecommerce.\n\nEspecially since these businesses often need flexible pricing structures based on volume, customer relationships, or contract agreements.  \n\nYou can also assign your customers to specific groups, each with dedicated price lists. That allows for dynamic pricing based on customer loyalty, purchase history, or volume.\n\nWith over 160 payment options, built-in SEO features, and abandoned cart integrations, Shift4Shop is a complete ecommerce solution for businesses targeting both B2C and B2B markets.\n\nShift4Shop has a minimum sales requirement.

Advanced users may find it restrictive in terms of design and functionality.\n\nAlso, GoDaddy’s hosting is great for small or medium-sized sites. \n\nHowever, high-traffic or resource-intensive websites might experience performance issues.\n\nOur favorite features:\n\nManage everything in one place: GoDaddy can handle everything from web hosting to email hosting to your ecommerce site\nChoose how customers pay for shipping: You can choose whether customers pay a flat rate for shipping, or based on the weight of their purchase\nDesign branded content with GoDaddy Studio: For you to use on your site, social media, or in emails\n24/7 appointment booking: If you provide services, customers can book and pay online without the risk of double-bookings\nFree to start: You only pay when you’re happy with the design and ready to start fulfilling orders\n9.

These include:\n\nUser-Friendly Interface\n\nAn intuitive, user-friendly interface is essential so people without coding knowledge can build ecommerce websites. These tools typically utilize drag-and-dropfunctions, so you can customize the look and feel of your store easily.\n\nWix, for example, has pre-made templates for pages you can add. \n\nThe best ecommerce website builders also offer easy-to-follow tutorials so you can get started in no time. \n\nFor example, BigCommerce offers in-depth video tutorials and an extensive knowledge base to guide you through the process.\n\nUser-friendly interfaces remove barriers to entry and make it easy for anyone to start selling online.\n\nSEO\n\nSEO tools help search engines understand your website’s content and structure. \n\nThe result is higher rankings on search engine results pages. \n\nSo, check that your builder offers SEO features like customizable URLs, meta tags, and sitemaps. \n\nThe bare minimum features you’re looking for include page titles, meta descriptions, and page content editable fields.\n\nSemrush offers an extensive SEO toolkit that helps with technical optimization, keyword research, and linking strategies.\n\nIf you’re just starting, you might want keyword ideas to target. \n\nHead to the Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nEnter a keyword related to your business.

Additional features help you branch out, amplify your social reach, and make decisions faster.\n\nMobile Responsiveness \n\nMobile responsiveness ensures your website adapts to the device someone views it on which it’s viewed. This way, the design, images, and functionality work as intended across various screen sizes and orientations.\n\nMobile sales make up almost 60% of all ecommerce sales worldwide, so mobile responsiveness has become a necessity for ecommerce sites.\n\nCheck if the builders you want to use you’re considering offer mobile-friendly templates. They’re usually pre-optimized for every device size.\n\nSquarespace, for example, offers responsive templates that adjust to fit any screen.\n\nThese sites often let you preview how your design looks on phones via a “mobile view” feature. It’s a great way to see if the design needs to make any adjustments without having to switch between multiple devices. \n\nHere’s what Wix’s mobile editor looks like: \n\nHaving a responsive site ensures users browsing your website on mobile devices convert into paying customers.\n\nPricing Plans\n\nThe right pricing structure aligns with your business goals, the features you need, and the budget you’ve allocated.\n\nMany builders offer tiered pricing so you can ensure the features offered at each tier match your requirements. \n\nShopify, for example, offers different pricing plans based on the size of your business.\n\nLook for platforms that state their prices clearly without hidden fees. Unexpected charges for essential features can be frustrating and detrimental to your bottom line.\n\nComparison charts (like the one Shopify offers) state what you get (or miss out on) with each pricing plan.\n\nLastly, free trials are helpful since they give you hands-on experiences with the tools and interface. If the options you’re considering offer them, use them so you’re sure.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nReliable customer support helps you troubleshoot any issues and ensures there are minimal interruptions in your workflow. Look for platforms that offer live chat, call centers, and email support, along with thorough FAQs and tutorials.\n\nFor example, Shopify’s live chat feature is available 24/7.

You don’t want to wait hours for an answer after your site breaks down.\n\nWebsite Security\n\nCheck that the builder you choose secures their servers with SSL Certificates and provides features like fraud detection, payment gateway integration, and customer account security.\n\nA robust security system helps customers feel safe when entering their payment details on the checkout page. It also safeguards you from malicious attacks, saving you money in the long run.\n\nSee the padlock next to Apple’s URL?\n\nIt shows the website is secure with an SSL Certificate. URLs also have “https” next to them to indicate this added layer of security.  when they’re secure.\n\nFor instance, GoDaddy offers multiple SSL Certificate options compatible with any website builder.\n\nYou can choose from various encryption levels, depending on how much security you need. \n\nApart from this, look for access control options that help you manage user or admin permissions based on roles. \n\nThat helps you limit the types of tasks each user can access, adding an extra layer of security to your ecommerce store. \n\nScalability\n\nScalability allows your platform to grow with your business. As you add more products, customers, and transactions, the platform can keep up with demand without slowing down or crashing. \n\nLook for features like:\n\nUnlimited listings: Platforms that allow unlimited product uploads to ensure you’re not restricted as your inventory grows\nRobust hosting: A hosting solution that guarantees fast load times and minimal downtime, even during peak traffic\nFlexible payment gateways: Ensure your builder integrates solutions seamlessly, from PayPal to Stripe to localized payment methods\nBulk import/export: This feature helps you update large quantities of product details or migrate data when necessary\n\nA website builder that eliminates the need to switch platforms as your business scales is a great bonus. \n\nIntegrations\n\nIntegrations extend the functionality of your platform. They also ensure that as your business evolves, your website can keep up without needing major overhauls.\n\nLook for platforms that offer integrations with popular payment gateways, shipping companies, customer relationship management (CRM) tools, and email marketing services. \n\nFor example, BigCommerce offers a wide selection of pre-integrated apps.\n\nApplication Programming Interface (API) access is another key factor to consider. \n\nBigCommerce’s open API architecture makes it easy to integrate with third-party services and build customizations.\n\nSuppose you want to create a personalized website experience that reflects your brand. \n\nCustomization options allow you to create a unique look and feel for your ecommerce store. They also help you tailor the customer experience with features like one-click checkouts and abandoned cart reminders.\n\nKeep Your Ecommerce Website in Check\n\nBuilding an ecommerce website from scratch is an exciting process.
