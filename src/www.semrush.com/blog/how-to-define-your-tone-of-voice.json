  "content": "Quick Summary\n\nOur article explains how a consistent \"tone of voice\" can help a company create a unique and recognizable brand identity.\n\nWe discuss defining your target audience and tailoring the tone of voice to appeal to them.\n\nWe cover the importance of a consistent tone of voice across all marketing materials, including website copy, social media posts, and customer communications.\n\nOur article suggests a style guide to ensure consistency in language, grammar, and punctuation across all materials.\n\nWe conclude by encouraging you to review and update the tone of voice to ensure it remains consistent with your company's evolving brand identity.\n\nWhat Is Tone of Voice?\n\nTone of voice is the way a person speaks to someone. It refers to the choice of words, volume, pitch, and speed of the message, and can affect how the listener perceives and responds to the speaker.\n\nIf not done correctly, the message might be misunderstood or overlooked.\n\nTone of voice can affect how the listener perceives and responds to the speaker. \n\nIn the context of branding and marketing, tone of voice is how a brand communicates with its audience through messaging and customer interactions.\n\nIt helps businesses differentiate themselves from the competition and communicate their brand values to their audience.\n\nFor example, Old Spice is known for their humorous tone of voice.\n\nTheir absurd, memorable ads set them apart from others in the personal care industry:\n\nTone of voice includes the words and imagery you choose (and the order you put them in) across every content format. Including emails, landing pages, ads, social media posts, blog posts, and more.\n\nBy the end of this article, you’ll learn how to:\n\nIdentify your brand’s values\nFind the perfect tone of voice for your business\nObserve how your audience communicates\nCreate and implement a tone of voice guide\n\nReady to get started? \n\nUse our template to follow along.\n\nFirst, let’s cover a few examples.\n\nTone of Voice Examples\n\nNike’s tone of voice is serious and powerful. They’ve run many campaigns over the years encouraging athletes to be the best they can be.\n\nHere’s an example from their “Dream Crazier” campaign:\n\nMany brands also show off a more playful side, as Dunkin’ does in this Instagram post:\n\nOld Spice, Nike, and Dunkin’ show how tone of voice can vary drastically from brand to brand. \n\nWhy Tone of Voice Is Important\n\nThe words and images you use shape how your customers view your brand.\n\nWhich is crucial, because 88% of respondents in a recent survey said it was important to purchase from brands that they trust.\n\nThink about crafting a personality for your brand—how should your brand “speak” to others? What message should come across?\n\nNailing down a specific tone of voice will help you:\n\nCut through the competition \nBuild your brand (and authority)\nEmulate face-to-face communication\nCut Through the Competition\n\nMany brands fall into the trap of adopting a tone of voice someone in their industry “should” use. However, your goal should be to stand out so you customers remember you.\n\nTake BlenderBottle for example. They avoid the typical hyper-masculine tone of protein powder and fitness brands:\n\nBuild Your Brand (and Authority)\n\nLet’s look at Duolingo as an example here. They’ve taken TikTok by storm, gaining over four million followers and becoming an ongoing meme on the site.\n\nTheir videos always include “Duo,” the green owl, who’s often seen engaging in office shenanigans, lamenting over their crush (Dua Lipa), and following the latest TikTok trends:\n\nDuolingo took a risk by fully embracing an irreverent, goofy tone on this app, but it clearly paid off. They now have a massive organic presence on users’ “for you” pages and have become a familiar character for many on TikTok.\n\nEmulate Face-to-Face Communication\n\nThese days, customers will often reach out to brands via social media or online chat rather than call a customer service number.\n\nYou can also take this time to reinforce your tone of voice.\n\nMany brands take it one step further and proactively respond to complaints that mention their brand name on social media.\n\nHere’s an example of Spotify doing that on Twitter:\n\nSpotify is “really protective of tone of voice.” Each member of the social media team goes through rigorous writing assessments, and the brand has specific Twitter accounts dedicated to customer service.\n\nBrand Voice vs. Tone of Voice: What’s the Difference?\n\nBrand Voice represents your brand’s unique perspective and the values you stand for. In other words, this is your brand’s overall personality.\n\nYour tone of voice refers to how your brand communicates with your audience, which can include word choice, communication style, and emotional tone.\n\nThis means your tone of voice can change somewhat based on what’s most appropriate for the situation.\n\nLet’s use Volvo to demonstrate the difference. Their brand voice is about safety, which they spell out on their website:\n\nTheir tone of voice communicates how safety is a priority by making it a focal point in most of their marketing materials.\n\nSeatbelt specifics aren’t always a big selling point of vehicles, but Volvo makes this a focal point in their ads:\n\nVolvo does a good job of driving home its main values and puts the customer and their safety first. It’s clear that they have a defined mission statement and are communicating it to their audience (more on this next).\n\nHow to Find Your Brand’s Tone of Voice\n\nNow that you understand what a tone of voice is and why it’s important for business, we’ll show you how to find yours. \n\nStep 1: Define Your Core Values\n\nTo define your core values, reflect on what makes your company unique and what your brand stands for.\n\nLet’s look at an example of a core values statement by Zappos. They not only list their ten core values, but also take the time to explain what they represent and why they’ve chosen them.\n\nThis makes it easy for both employees and customers to know what to expect when interacting with Zappos.\n\nTo start defining your core values, you need to do two things:\n\nCreate a mission statement\nEstablish a brand message architecture \n\nHere’s how:\n\nCreate a Mission Statement\n\nCompose a concise brand mission statement that shows your users who you are, what you care about, and what your brand does to achieve its goals. \n\nStrong mission statements answer these questions:\n\nWhat are your company goals?\nHow do you plan to achieve your goals?\nWho is your target audience?\nWhat do you want your company to be known for?\n\nWrite down your answers to these questions and work with your stakeholders to come up with a mission statement based on the results.\n\nHere’s a mission statement from Microsoft: “Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.”\n\nGrounds & Hounds, an online coffee store, has a page dedicated to their mission statement:\n\nThe Grounds & Hounds mission statement shows that the company is purpose-driven. A study by Zeno Group shows that customers are four to six times more likely to support and buy from companies that are purpose-driven.\n\nOnce you have a mission statement, you can share it on your website, with your audience, and with your employees. \n\nEstablish a Message Architecture\n\nBrand messaging architecture aligns your brand’s overall communication and brand values across all your content creators. \n\nA message architecture is a set of communication goals (usually a list of terms, phrases, and statements). \n\nFor example, your message architecture might include goals like “friendly and playful” aor “professional and authoritative.”\n\nHere’s an example Optimizely put together for Facebook:\n\nTo create your own message architecture, compile a list of up to 50-100 adjectives that describe your industry, and sort them together into three groups:\n\nWho we are\nWho we would like to be\nWho we are not\n\nAfter sorting the adjectives, focus on the words listed in the “Who we would like to be” category. Group adjectives into categories and organize them in order of priority (like the above Facebook example).\n\nYou can flesh these out with sub-bullets and color-coding as needed to help clarify their meanings.\n\nFinally, update your content strategy with your completed architecture.\n\nStep 2: Define Your Brand’s Tone of Voice\n\nNow that you’ve determined the “why” behind your company, you can begin to craft a unique tone of voice.\n\nTo start defining your tone of voice, come up with adjectives that describe your desired tone.\n\nYou can use the Nielsen Norman Group’s four dimensions of tone of voice to map where your brand falls in each category:\n\nFunny vs. serious\nFormal vs. casual\nRespectful vs. irreverent\nEnthusiastic vs. matter-of-fact\n\nYou can also use these “tone of voice words” to define how you want your brand to communicate:\n\nDecide where your brand’s voice should fall on each spectrum to determine the right tone of voice to use.\n\nHere’s an example from The Adventurists that’s on the irreverent side:\n\nYou can use AI tools like ContentShake to determine whether your copy uses a consistent and relevant tone of voice.\n\nFirst, the tool will help you write your article using AI and competitive data suggestions. Then, it'll score your draft based on its readability, SEO, and tone of voice.\n\nFor example, you’ll be able to see which sentences are too formal or too casual and quickly edit them.\n\nNow let’s look at some examples.\n\nFormal vs. Casual\n\nUsing a formal tone can help your brand appear more authoritative, but may also feel impersonal.\n\nCasual language can help create a sense of personality and friendliness. On the other hand, using too casual a tone in the wrong context can make you seem inexperienced or unprofessional.\n\nThis tweet from Prada is formal and to the point. It doesn’t include emojis and has more serious, editorial photographs that showcase the outfits.\n\nThis tweet from Healthy Roots Dolls is more playful in tone. It includes an emoji as well as fun images:\n\nFunny vs. Serious\n\nWhen choosing between a funny and serious tone, remember that a funny tone won’t fit all companies. And humor shouldn’t get in the way of actually communicating with your audience.\n\nBarkbox’s 404 page is modeled after a comic strip and includes a joke:\n\nDesigner News keeps things more serious with their 404 page. They add a touch of creativity, but keep the tone pretty dry:\n\nRespectful vs. Irreverent\n\nIt’s good to be respectful to your audience, but you also don’t want to overdo it. You may not come across as genuine if you’re always pandering to your users.\n\nUsing an irreverent tone, on the other hand, can make your brand seem confident and fun. But, be careful not to intimidate or offend your audience.\n\nSafety Wing keeps things on the respectful side. Their overall design and tone isn’t stuffy or serious, but they keep their tone helpful and direct.\n\nDeadhappy’s homepage, however, is the epitome of irreverent tone. It’s fun, unexpected, and atypical for the insurance industry:\n\nEnthusiastic vs. Matter-of-Fact\n\nAn enthusiastic tone can help you come across as helpful and friendly. But when used at inappropriate times, it may irritate your audience.\n\nWhile matter-of-fact language gives a feeling of honesty and simplicity. But when executed poorly, it may be seen as indifferent or lacking in personality.\n\nFirst, let’s look at 8000Kicks, a hemp shoe brand. Their copy is on the enthusiastic side and includes several tongue-in-cheek moments in just a few lines of text:\n\nOff the Clock, an eyeliner and false eyelash brand, is more matter-of-fact. They thank the customer for their purchase and include helpful links within the message.\n\nNow let’s use these examples to create your brand’s tone of voice profile.\n\nHere’s what that might look like:\n\nEvaluate your tone of voice\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\nStep 3: Observe Your Audience\n\nNow that you know how to define your tone of voice, let’s discuss how to tweak it for your customers.\n\nCustomers expect brands to understand their needs and expectations. One great way to get to know your customers is to find out what social media platforms they use and how they interact with one another.\n\nTo begin, find out which channels your audience prefers. \n\nThe best way to do so is to go directly to the source, whether that’s Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, or elsewhere.\n\nBut how do you find which sites your audience uses? Start with a Google search.\n\nUse the “site search” method, which looks like this: site:www.website.com your brand here\n\nBy searching this way, Google will show you results only from the sites you include.\n\nYou can search on multiple sites by including “OR” between them.\n\nSo if you wanted to see what people were saying about Chipotle on Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram, it would look like this:\n\nTip: You can also use Semrush’s Market Explorer tool to find out more about your audience’s demographics.\n\nTake some time to research your results and take notes. What positive things are people saying? What negative things? Are there any trends? \n\nYou can use this information to tweak your overall tone of voice, or even plan social content.\n\nIf your brand is new or you don’t get a lot of results this way, you can also perform the search with your competitor’s brand names.\n\nTake Note of How Your Audience Communicates with One Other\n\nNow that you know where your audience hangs out online, pay attention to how they communicate with one another and use their vocabulary as inspiration.\n\nFacebook groups can be a treasure trove of information. \n\nTo start, head to Facebook and type in your keyword in the search bar (we chose “SEO”).\n\nOnce you get your results, click “Groups” on the left-hand navigation to only view Facebook groups.\n\nJoin relevant groups to see how members talk about brands in your industry. This is a great place to start learning how your audience members communicate.\n\nMirroring how your audience communicates can make your content pieces more relatable. If done right, this can even lead to an increase in sales.\n\nHere are questions to consider when analyzing your customers’ voices on social media:\n\nDo they speak in full sentences or more casually?\nDo they incorporate emojis?\nWhat kind of slang do they use?\nDo they talk to brands directly?\nWhat generation are they from?\nWhat do they like?\nWhat do they dislike?\n\nIt’s also a good idea to answer the same questions about your competitors’ audiences. Learn from their previous successes and mistakes to determine what might work for your audience.\n\nHere’s an example of how Chipotle successfully mirrors tone on TikTok by using a casual, Gen Z-leaning tone:\n\nAnd another example from Wendy’s on Instagram:\n\nKeep in mind that this isn’t a “one-and-done” step. Social media trends and slang are constantly evolving.\n\nSpend some time doing social media research each month when you’re planning your social posts. \n\nAnd, of course, consistently interact with your followers. This doubles as research and tone of voice establishment for your brand. A win-win.\n\nStep 4: Create & Implement Tone of Voice Guidelines\n\nTo successfully implement your tone of voice, start by setting clear brand guidelines. Review them every once in a while, especially when there are changes in your target audience.\n\nStart with creating your guidelines in the brand’s tone of voice you have defined—this will create a perfect example of correctly using it when writing.\n\nInclude both correct and incorrect examples of your tone of voice to show your team members what to do as well as what to avoid.\n\nYour internal guidelines should include:\n\nA portrait of your target audience and their voice\nYour brand’s attitude to your audience (i.e., how formal or casual to be)\nYour brand’s core values\nYour mission statement\nYour message architecture\nVocabulary to use\nVocabulary to avoid\nGrammar rules\n\nOnce you’ve created the first version of your style guide, share it with your company.\n\nCreate Your Own Tone of Voice Guidelines\n\nYour tone of voice is how you connect and engage with your audience. The best way to do that is to align it with your brand values and mission as well as with your audience’s voice. \n\nOnce you have an idea of what it should look like, match your tone of voice to the content format you’re using to communicate.\n\nIf you haven’t already, create your own tone of voice guidelines with our free template.\n\nDon’t be afraid to get creative—the goal is to stand out from your competition. And by sticking to a consistent, unique tone of voice, your brand can gain authority (and popularity) within your niche.\n\nMaintain a Consistent Tone of Voice in Your Copy\n\nEasily improve every piece of content with ContentShake - optimize your text for readers and search engines.\n\nTry it Now for Free →",
