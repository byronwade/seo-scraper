  "content": "What Are Key Performance Indicators?\n\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) are specific metrics companies choose to quantify their performance and measure progress toward their unique goals. Which means goals play a huge role in choosing key performance indicators.\n\nThat also means every company’s KPIs will be slightly different.\n\nAnd they can range in scope from affecting the entire organization to a particular department, team, or even individual project. \n\nMetrics vs. KPIs\n\nMetrics are any quantitative measures you use to track and assess business activities. They’re raw data about your business and its departments—and there are countless ones you can measure.\n\nKPIs are also metrics. But they’re the specific ones that indicate how well you’re achieving business goals. \n\nHere’s a quick overview of the main differences:\n\n \t\n\nKPIs\n\n\t\n\nMetrics\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\t\n\nPerformance evaluation against business goals\n\n\t\n\nGeneral tracking and reporting\n\n\n\n\nImportance\n\n\t\n\nCritical for business success\n\n\t\n\nNot always important but can be\n\n\n\n\nSelection\n\n\t\n\nA few, based on importance to your business\n\n\t\n\nMany available\n\nBenefits of Implementing KPIs\n\nKPIs provide a clear, quantifiable way to evaluate performance.\n\nMore specifically, they help with:\n\nObjective measurement: KPIs offer a way for you to determine whether you’re moving in the right direction to meet your goals. For example, you might use revenue growth, customer acquisition rates, or social media engagement as KPIs to measure success toward specific department goals.\nIdentifying problems: Regularly monitoring your KPIs can highlight areas where performance is lagging. For example, if website traffic is a KPI and suddenly drops, it could indicate issues with search engine optimization (SEO), content, or technical matters.\nMaking informed decisions: KPIs help you base your decisions on concrete findings rather than guesswork. For example, if your marketing campaigns aren’t achieving your intended conversion rate, you can take steps to optimize your ads and content for conversions.\nEnsuring alignment: KPIs serve as a common language for everyone to see if they’re on track\nTypes of KPIs\n\nWhile your specific KPIs will depend on your business and departments, these are some of the main ones:\n\nFinancial KPIs\n\nFinancial KPIs measure a business's financial performance. And provide insight into its overall health. \n\nExamples include:\n\nKPI\n\n\t\n\nFormula\n\n\t\n\nWhat It Measures\n\n\t\n\nSample Use Case\n\n\n\n\nRevenue growth\n\n\t\n\n((Current period revenue - previous period revenue) / previous period revenue) x 100\n\n\t\n\nAbility to make more money over time\n\n\t\n\nAssessing the impact of a new pricing strategy \n\n\n\n\nGross profit margin\n\n\t\n\n((Revenue - cost of goods sold) / revenue) x 100\n\n\t\n\nHow profitable the business is\n\n\t\n\nEvaluating profitability after implementing a new system\n\n\n\n\nReturn on investment (ROI)\n\n\t\n\n(Revenue from investment - cost of investment) / cost of investment\n\n\t\n\nHow successful or effective investments are relative to others\n\n\t\n\nMeasuring the financial return of a marketing campaign \n\nMarketing KPIs\n\nWhat are KPIs in marketing?

Identify Your Priorities\n\nStart by identifying what successful performance would look like. And use that to inform your broad, long-term goals. \n\nExamples might include:\n\nIncreasing market share\nBoosting profitability\nExpanding product lines\n\nThen, solidify those goals for your organization. Which will help in defining departmental goals.\n\nAnd all these goals should be SMART:\n\nSpecific: It should be clear and provide enough detail\nMeasurable: It should be something you can easily track with the metrics (these will become your KPIs)\nAchievable: It should be something you can realistically attain\nRelevant: It should logically align with your vision\nTime-bound: It should include some sort of timeline for when you want to see results\n\nYour KPIs will naturally emerge once you’ve determined your goals.\n\nFor example, let’s say one of the main marketing goals is to increase website conversion rates by 30% in the next year to support the business’s overall goal of increasing revenue by 10% over the next year.\n\nYour marketing KPIs might be:\n\nWebsite conversion rate\nClick-through rate (CTR) from organic (unpaid) search engine results\nClick-through rate from paid search engine ads\n2. Balance Leading and Lagging Indicators\n\nIt could be helpful to split your indicators into two types: leading and lagging.\n\nLeading indicators are metrics that help to predict future outcomes. And help you make adjustments early on to better reach goals. \n\nLagging indicators are the metrics that reveal how effective your past efforts are. And help you see clearly whether you reached your goals.\n\nTo get a well-rounded view of your performance, combine leading and lagging indicators.\n\nUsing the same example from above, both CTRs are leading indicators. And website conversion rate is a lagging indicator. \n\n3. Benchmark Against Industry Competitors\n\nCompetitive benchmarking is when you compare your business’s performance against that of your rivals. Which helps you understand what needs improvement and where you stand in the market.\n\nAfter you’ve determined your KPIs, do some research to see how you compare against your rivals. You can do this by reading competitors’ annual reports, industry studies, etc.\n\nYou can also gather competitive insights using Semrush tools. \n\nFor example, Organic Research can help you uncover a lot of SEO-related metrics that you might be using as KPIs. Like total keyword rankings.\n\nAnd Social Tracker (part of Semrush Social) makes it easy to see how your social media marketing efforts stack up against your competitors.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ SEO Results\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Set a Review Cadence and Measure Results\n\nRegularly reviewing KPIs helps you track progress and make informed decisions. \n\nThe exact frequency depends on your KPIs. But common frequencies include:\n\nDaily: For dynamic metrics that change frequently (e.g., social media engagements)\nWeekly: For metrics that benefit from regular monitoring but don’t require daily attention (e.g., organic traffic)\nMonthly: For more strategic metrics that take time to show significant changes (e.g., customer retention rate)\nQuarterly/annually: For metrics that provide a broad overview of business health (e.g., revenue growth)\n\nThen, use appropriate tools to measure your KPIs.\n\nAs an example, let’s illustrate how to track organic search rankings with Semrush’s Position Tracking tool.\n\nEnter your domain and configure the tool in a few steps.\n\nClick the “Overview” tab. \n\nYou’ll see a graph of your visibility and how it’s changed over time.\n\nScroll down to the “Rankings Overview” section. You’ll see a table of your keywords and their positions.\n\nYou can then use this information (and information on your other KPIs) to build reports and dashboards to easily review performance. Visuals like charts and graphs highlight trends to help you understand the data. \n\nSemrush’s My Reports is one place you can track and report on KPIs.\n\nSimply select one of the ready-to-use templates or start a report from scratch (depending on your needs).\n\nUse the widgets on the left-hand menu to guide your report creation.\n\nYou can also add commentary to provide more insight into what each KPI is showing. Which makes it easy for anyone to understand and interpret the results. \n\nFurther reading: KPI Reports 101: A Beginner’s Guide to Business Metrics\n\nTrack Your Rankings\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nCommon KPI Pitfalls to Avoid\n\nHere are some common KPI pitfalls to avoid:\n\nSetting Too Many KPIs\n\nYou might believe that tracking more data will provide a more comprehensive view of performance. But this really just makes it easy to lose focus on what truly matters.\n\nLimit your KPIs to only ones that align with your goals. \n\nFocusing on Vanity Metrics\n\nVanity metrics are numbers that look good on paper but don't necessarily mean much in terms of performance (like total views for a specific page). And they can give you a false sense of success. \n\nInstead, prioritize meaningful KPIs that reflect on your desired outcomes. \n\nFailing to Communicate the Importance of KPIs to Everyone\n\nIndividual employees may not understand how their work contributes to their larger department or the company. Which makes it less likely that your KPIs will be taken seriously.\n\nClearly communicate the importance of each KPI. Explain how they align with business goals and how individual contributions can be impactful.\n\nChoose and Track of Meaningful KPIs\n\nWithout carefully chosen KPIs, you won’t have any idea of how you’re progressing toward goals. Or whether you eventually meet them.\n\nWhich is why you should take the time to set goals and pick a select number of metrics to use as your KPIs.\n\nFrom there, Semrush tools can help with much of the tracking.\n\nSign up for free to try them out.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
