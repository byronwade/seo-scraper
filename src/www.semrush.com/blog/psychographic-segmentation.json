  "content": "What Is Psychographic Segmentation? \n\nPsychographic segmentation in marketing is a form of market segmentation where you group consumers into segments based on criteria. Like consumers’ personalities, interests, and social statuses.\n\nWhy Is Psychographic Segmentation Useful?\n\nPsychographic market segmentation helps you create detailed buyer personas (a fictional profile of your ideal customer). \n\nAnd gives you a deep understanding of your audience. \n\nThat deep understanding helps your business perform several activities that can improve your business.\n\nImprove Messaging\n\nUnderstanding consumer interests helps you improve your messaging. Like the copy for your ads. Or the content in your blog posts.\n\nFor example, say you own a fitness apparel brand. And you discover through psychographic research that a large segment of your audience likes to hike.\n\nIn your messaging, you can reference how your apparel is made from material that keeps hikers cool. \n\nThis callout can help your brand relate deeply to your consumer.\n\nTailor Your Marketing Funnel\n\nYour marketing funnel is a simplified approach for how people become aware of your brand and turn to customers. \n\nConsumers expect tailored messaging tuned to their needs. These needs differ depending on where they are in your funnel. And what types of people they are.\n\nFor example, say a clothing brand learns a segment of their customers is environmentally conscious. So, they decide to create an email sequence that highlights how their brand is eco-friendly. To help this segment in the “consideration” stage.\n\nThese tailored touchpoints can turn more people into loyal customers. \n\nIncrease Brand Loyalty\n\nMany consumers say they’re more likely to buy from a brand that shares their values. And psychographic research helps you uncover those values. \n\nThen, you can build those same values into your business.\n\nSay you learn that your audience values a good work-life balance. You could highlight how your company empowers team members to take time off and focus on hobbies outside of work.\n\nCustomers will be more likely to turn to repeat buyers when they see their values reflect back to them.\n\nDevelop Innovative Features and Products\n\nBy developing psychographic segments, you can spot opportunities for new offers that grow your business.\n\nA grocery store might learn that a segment of their customers likes to cook. But they also work long hours and don't have time to prepare food. So, the store could create a selection of prepared meals that only require cooking. But no preparation. \n\nIt’s easier to develop products your consumers will enjoy when you understand them.\n\nSegment Your Audience by Psychographics\n\nwith Audience Intelligence\n\nTry for Free →\nLimitations of Psychographic Segmentation\n\nHere are some things to take into consideration before investing into psychographic market research. \n\nCostly\n\nPsychographic research can be costly to run. \n\nA single focus group may cost anywhere from $4,000 to $15,000. \n\nAnd surveys may range from $0.95 to $5 per completed survey response. Meaning a single survey with 500 responses can cost $475 to $2,500. \n\nYou can reduce the cost by leveraging published insights. And using tools that analyze audiences for you. \n\nRoom for Error\n\nPsychographic research contains a mix of qualitative data—non-numerical data—and quantitative data—numerical data. \n\nFor example, asking someone to describe their morning routine gives you a qualitative response. (“I get up and have coffee. Then, I shower and get ready for work.”)\n\nAsking someone what time they wake up gives you a quantitative response. (6 a.m.)\n\nQuantitative data is easier to sort and analyze. Because it uses concrete numbers. While qualitative data is often up for interpretation. And your team might draw incorrect conclusions. Which can lead to a strategy that doesn’t align with your audience.\n\nFor example, say you’re an outerwear brand. And a survey reveals that your audience likes extreme sports. So, you create a new apparel line that caters to thrill-seekers. \n\nHowever, your product launch flops. And further research reveals that your audience only likes to watch extreme sports—not participate in them.\n\nTo avoid errors, cross-check various data points. And test new ideas on a small scale to validate findings. \n\nEvolving Preferences\n\nConsumer preferences change constantly. And the psychographic segmentation you conduct this year might not be relevant in several years. \n\nBut that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t perform psychographic research.\n\nBuild systems into your business that constantly collect feedback and data from customers. Like a sales team that adds customer insights into a living document. \n\nThen, compare this data over the years to see how your audience is changing. \n\nMajor changes in preferences might indicate that it’s time to redo your psychographic segmentation. \n\nAs a bonus, you’ll have a head start on data collection if you’re continuously collecting customer insights.\n\nHow to Build Psychographic Segments\n\nThese steps walk you through the entire process to create valuable psychographic segments.\n\nCollect Current Data\n\nCompile the data you have already so you know where to focus your energy. \n\nFor example, if you recently conducted a survey, you might not want to spend time reasking the same questions (assuming the responses were insightful).\n\nPull audience data from sales teams, past customer interactions (like surveys), and your web analytics software. \n\nGoogle Analytics offers basic psychographic information on the people who visit your site. Like their interests.\n\nIdentify Broad Segments\n\nBroad segments help you initially define who to research, survey, and speak with.\n\nFor example, you might not know the age ranges of your audience. Age isn’t a psychographic factor, it’s a demographic factor. But it helps you nail down the right group of people to research for your psychographic segmentation.\n\nTo build out broad segments, use Semrush's One2Target tool. In your Semrush account, click “One2Target” under “.Trends.”\n\nSelect your location, enter up to five competing domains, and click “Analyze.”\n\nClick the four tabs along the top to access detailed reports. Like this one for “Demographics.”\n\nWe used eBay for this example. And its demographic report tells us that most of their audience resides in the United States. And is 25 to 34 years of age. \n\nThis tells you the age ranges, genders, and residing countries to use for your psychographic segmentation research. For example, eBay likely wouldn’t host a focus group with people over 65 years old. This age group is too small of a segment for them.\n\nNext, click the “Socioeconomics” tab to discover household size, income level, employment status, and education level. \n\nAnd the “Behavior” tab tells you what this audience likes and which social platforms they use. \n\nTip\n\nKnowing which platforms consumers frequent helps you pinpoint where to focus your marketing efforts. And spend your ad dollars.\n\nLastly, the “Audience Overlap” tab tells you which other websites your audience visits. This can help you identify their hobbies, interests, and lifestyles. Which are psychographic variables we’ll cover later on.\n\nIdentify Audience Segments\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\nSelect Data Collection Methods\n\nThere are several ways to collect psychographic data on your audience:\n\nFocus groups: Schedule in-person or online focus groups. Tools like User Interviews help you create virtual focus groups.\nSurveys: Use a tool like Hotjar to add surveys to your website. Or SurveyMonkey to send surveys to specific groups of people.\nBrainstorming sessions: Sit with customer-facing team members and brainstorm what you already know about your audience.\nPublicly available research reports: Places like government websites, public libraries, and nonprofits (like Pew Research Center) have free reports you can use to learn more about your segments. \nWeb analytics: Tools like Google Analytics may provide basic psychographic information.\nMarket research tools: Use One2Target to gather immediate and actionable data. Or, get in-depth insights with the Audience Intelligence app.\nCustomer interviews: Interview customers one on one to gather in-depth information.\nSocial media: Spend time where your audience hangs out online. See how they interact with one another, what they say, and how they describe their pain points. \n\nUnsure which research methods are best for you?\n\nAnswer these two questions:\n\nWhat level of depth do we need? You may need deeper insight if you don’t have previous information on your audience. For example, focus groups can yield deep exploration into your audience. But they’re more expensive. Surveys can get you a large amount of data, but the data tends to be broad. \nWhat’s our budget? Larger budgets can accommodate activities like focus groups. Whereas teams with smaller budgets may want to opt for other methods of data collection (like market research tools or surveys).\n\nIf possible, combine multiple methods. To get a range of data and insight.\n\nGather Data\n\nThe time it takes to gather data depends on your data collection methods. Methods like customer interviews and focus groups can be more time-consuming than a survey blast. \n\nHowever, as a general rule, aim to spend a few weeks on data collection. This ensures you don’t rush the process. And have enough time to gather the information you need for useful psychographic segments.\n\nAs for which types of data to collect, there are five main variables used in psychographic segmentation:\n\nPersonality\nLifestyle\nSocial status\nActivities, interests, and opinions\nAttitudes \nPersonality\n\nPersonality traits help you understand how your audience moves through the world. And how they interact with people. \n\nUse the the big five personality traits (OCEAN) to analyze your audience:\n\nOpenness (how open someone is to new experiences): People with a high level of openness tend to be more adventurous and are eager to learn. Whereas someone with a low level might struggle with new experiences. \nConscientiousness (how responsible and organized someone is): Conscientious people plan ahead and think about how their actions affect others. Someone who isn’t conscientious doesn’t like schedules and rigidity. \nExtroversion (how social and assertive someone is): Someone with high levels of extroversion is talkative and likes being the center of attention. On the other hand, someone with a low level of extroversion prefers solitude.\nAgreeableness (how cooperative and trustful someone is): People with a high level of agreeableness often help others. The opposite is those who are manipulative and uncooperative. \nNeuroticism (how emotionally stable someone is): People who are highly neurotic can be moody and anxious. Whereas someone with low levels of neurosis can cope with stress.\n\nFor example, if you learn a segment of your audience is not open, you may assume that this cohort needs additional educational resources to move them from skeptics to buyers.\n\nThe easiest way to collect OCEAN information is with the Audience Intelligence app.\n\nSimply enter the handle of an X (formerly Twitter) account that has a relevant follower base. (For example, your own handle or the handle of a popular influencer in your niche.)\n\nThen, go to the “Personality” tab to see detailed information for every dimension.\n\nYou can even focus on the specific segments the app identifies.\n\nThe Audience Intelligence app also provides detailed information about demographics and other psychographic information. \n\nAnalyze Audiences on X\n\nwith the Audience Intelligence App\n\nExplore Demo Reports →\nLifestyle\n\nLifestyle is how your audience lives their life and spends their money. And it’s influenced by various factors. Including their interests.\n\nAn example of a lifestyle is minimalism. \n\nMinimalists prioritize order and intentional living. And may align better with companies who advocate for ethical consumption. \n\nSocial Status\n\nSocial status is how people believe they fit into a hierarchical society based on things like their income, education level, or job titles.\n\nKnowing how your audience perceives themselves can help you price your products. And tailor your offerings. \n\nFor example, someone who believes they have a high social status will likely prefer luxury brands over mass-market brands.\n\nThis means they might expect premium service. Which you could work into your products.\n\nTo learn about your audience’s socioeconomic status, use the Audience Intelligence app:\n\nAnd get valuable insights into their buying mindset (e.g., how likely they are to indulge in spur-of-the-moment purchases).\n\nActivities, Interests, and Opinions (AIO)\n\nAIO defines elements your audience cares the most about. Like their hobbies. And what they do in their free time.\n\nUnderstanding their interests can help you position your products and connect with them on a deeper level.\n\nFor example, say you discover that a segment of your audience likes watching horror movies. You might decide to use references from popular horror movies in your marketing. To show you understand them.\n\nIn the Audience Intelligence app, you can identify the most popular interests among your chosen audience or segment.\n\nThe “Media affinity” report tells you which TV channels and shows, radio stations and shows, newspapers, magazines, events, etc., the audience or segment is most interested in.\n\nAttitudes\n\nPeople’s attitudes are usually shaped by their cultural backgrounds and upbringing. And these attitudes influence what people like and dislike. And predict buyer behavior.\n\nHere’s a simplified example: Let’s say you run a bakery. And you uncover a large segment of chocolate lovers.\n\nSo, you choose to stock your display cases with mostly chocolate baked goods. To appeal to this segment.\n\nOrganize, Define, and Name Segments\n\nAfter collecting your data, you’re ready to create segments.\n\nStructuring and cleaning your data ensures you can easily segment and analyze it.\n\nStart by compiling your data into a single dataset (like a spreadsheet).\n\nThen, clean it by removing duplicates, errors (such as “null” survey responses), and missing values.\n\nNext, identify psychographic variables within the data that can be used to define segments. \n\nFor example, if a significant number of people express an interest in reading in their spare time, consider creating a segment for “readers.”\n\nAfter your initial segments are identified, dive deeper into each segment to uncover additional defining characteristics shared among members. \n\nThis process helps refine segments and provides insights for targeted marketing strategies.\n\nValidate Segments\n\nAfter creating segments, take a final look over each one.\n\nFirst, make sure your segments are distinct from one another. Each segment should be unique with minimal overlapping characteristics.\n\nThen, check that each segment is sizable enough to target. This depends on your industry, competitive landscape, goals, and more. If a segment is too small, consider merging it with a similar one. Or removing it altogether. \n\nIf segments aren’t sizable or unique, you may want to go back to the previous step and revisit your raw data. \n\nReview and Repeat\n\nReview segments periodically so you know when it’s time to update your psychographic segments.\n\nBecause remember: Consumer preferences evolve over time. \n\nA good indicator that it’s time to refresh your segments is when you notice shifts in consumer behavior, new industry trends, or changes in societal values.\n\nCombining Psychographics with Other Segmentation Methods\n\nPair psychographic segmentation with other types of information for a deeper understanding of your audience.\n\nPsychographic vs. Demographic Segmentation \n\nDemographic data is your audience’s age, gender, income, education, and religion. Among other factors.\n\nPair demographic information and psychographics to identify certain age groups or income brackets that might have unique attitudes. \n\nPsychographic vs. Transactional Segmentation \n\nTransactional data opens your eyes to your audiences’ buying patterns—what they buy, how much they spend, and how much they spend each order. \n\nFor example, you might learn that a specific psychographic segment makes monthly purchases for your products. And that a monthly subscription could be something they’d enjoy.\n\nPsychographic vs. Behavioral Segmentation \n\nBehavioral data is how customers interact with your brand throughout the marketing funnel. \n\nThis might include information like how often they visit your website, open your emails, or read your blog posts.\n\nPairing behavioral and psychographic data might show you which types of customers prefer to read blog posts. \n\nThen, you can brainstorm blog post ideas that resonate with this specific segment’s interests and attitudes.\n\nExamples of Companies Using Psychographic Segmentation\n\nWe can’t say for sure which companies perform psychographic segmentation. As that research is typically private.\n\nHowever, the below three brands seemingly have distinct customer segments. These examples can give you an idea of how psychographic segmentation might look in real life.\n\nAritzia\n\nFashion brand Aritzia’s limited-edition collections showcase how they cater to a segment that likely values exclusivity and fashion.\n\nIndigo\n\nBook retailer Indigo likely understands that their audience cares about social issues. So, they feature books on their homepage relevant to diversity:\n\nAnd have a section dedicated to social responsibility in their site’s footer:\n\nNike\n\nGet a glimpse into Nike’s potential psychographic segments by clicking through their products. \n\nThe Air Max page displays stylish photos. Along with links to style the Air Max shoe. Which tells us this buyer may value fashion.\n\nCompare that to their outerwear products page. Which feature imagery of people out hiking and walking. And has less emphasis on style. And more on functionality. \n\nCreate Your Own Psychographic Segmentations\n\nPsychographic segments help you understand and connect with your audience. So you can sell more products and grow your business.\n\nSemrush’s One2Target tool gives you immediate insights on your audience. And unlike focus groups, it doesn’t cost a fortune to access.\n\nYou can also get valuable data about key segments on X with the Audience Intelligence app.\n\nReady to discover more about the people buying your products?
