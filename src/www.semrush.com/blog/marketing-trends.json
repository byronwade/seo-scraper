Marketers Will Adopt AI for Fast, Effective Content Creation\n\nGartner predicts that 80% of marketers in advanced creative roles will be using generative AI by 2026.\n\nWhich means marketers who want to stay ahead need to learn how to use AI effectively for content creation.\n\nNot using AI yet?\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\nGenerate images and videos for campaigns with tools such as DALL-E, AI Social Content Generator, and AI Video Marketing Automator\nGenerate text for social media, pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns, and more with ChatGPT, AI Text Generator, or Social Content AI\nGenerate content ideas and full, optimized blog posts withtools like ContentShake AI\n\nFor example, here are some content ideas generated by ContentShake AI:\n\nFrom there, you can click “Generate article.” And the tool will generate a fully-optimized article.

Brands That Produce High-Quality Content Will Drive More Traffic\n\nContent marketing is the strategic production and distribution of helpful and relevant content—e.g., blog posts, whitepapers, etc.—to attract and engage potential customers.\n\nQuality content positions your brand as an expert. Which can build trust with your target audience.\n\nYour content can also support potential customers through the buyer's journey. From first learning about your product to deciding to become a paying customer.\n\nCreate high-quality content by following Google’s Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) guidelines.\n\nMore specifically, keep the following in mind when you create content:\n\nResearch your target audience to understand their needs, preferences, and pain points. So you can address them with your content.\nUnderstand search intent to create relevant content your target audience actually wants\nDisplay experience and expertise by sharing real-world examples, valuable opinions, and actionable insights\nEnsure your article is well-researched, accurate, and original\n\nThat way, you can create content that is more likely to rank well. And that your target audience is actually interested in.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse ContentShake AI to easily generate high-quality, optimized content.\n \n\nSimply choose a topic, set your keywords, and watch your article come to life.\n \n\n  \nEdit the generated article for tone and accuracy. And hit “Publish.” \n\n3. More Businesses Will Invest in Nano- or Micro-Influencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing is when brands collaborate with individuals who have a dedicated online following (i.e., influencers) to promote products. Brands rely on influencers’ credibility and follower trust to drive consumer interest.\n\nIn 2024, brands were more likely to collaborate with nano- and micro-influencers (i.e., influencers with up to 100,000 followers) over macro-influencers and celebrities (influencers with 100,000 to over 1 million followers).\n\nBecause nano- and micro- influencers typically charge less than influencers with more followers. But still generate high engagement rates.\n\nNano-influencers get an average engagement rate of 4.59%. Which is the highest of all influencer groups.\n\nMicro-influencers have an engagement rate of 2.59%. Followed by mid-tier influencers at 1.71%.\n\nMacro-influencers engage their followers less on average with an engagement rate of 1.44%.\n\nPro tip\n\nIncrease the odds of achieving a positive return on investment (ROI) with your influencer marketing campaigns by collaborating with influencers whose followers belong to your target audience.\n\nFind the right influencers for your brand with Influencer Analytics.\n\nTell the tool what kind of influencer you want. And hit “Create magic.”\n\nFor example, we entered “pet influencer with a small female audience.”\n\nAnd got a list with over 17,000 influencer accounts.\n\nGo through the list. And find influencers whose followers are also members of your target audience. And are within your budget range.\n\nFurther reading: How to Find Influencers for Your Brand (Not Just on Instagram)\n\n4. Marketers Will Continue to Build Trust with User-Generated Content\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is content created by individuals and consumers. Businesses can repurpose it on social media, in email marketing campaigns, or on a website or landing page. \n\nThink of user-generated content as word-of-mouth recommendations. Because it reflects the opinions and views of your real-world customers.\n\nOnly 30% of consumers say they are able to highly trust companies.\n\nMeanwhile, 72% of consumers say customer reviews influence their purchase decisions. And 40% say customer-generated images and videos also influence their decision to buy.\n\nWhich is probably why many brands use UGC to build trust and authentic relationships with their target audience.\n\nHere are six ways you can generate UGC from your audience and existing customers:\n\nLook at customer reviews and testimonials on Google reviews, social media, or conversations between customers and your support team and turn them into social media posts\nSearch for brand and product mentions across the web using the Media Monitoring app to find stories that people share about your products. And share those stories on social media or on your blog\nEngage with communities on social media or forums like Reddit to encourage users to share more about their experiences with your brand\nCreate a brand hashtag, like Nike’s #JustDoIt or Coke’s #ShareACoke, and encourage your audience to use that hashtag when they create posts related to your product\nUse your purchase confirmation email or page to ask customers to create a photo, video, or leave a review\nHost a social media raffle to encourage customers to tag your account in a testimonial post for your product or service\n\nFor example, this is an Instagram post by skincare brand Blume featuring an image created by one of their happy customers, showing the efficacy of their product.\n\nThe post got a lot of engagement (over a thousand likes and hundreds of comments) which signals that their followers are interested in this type of content.\n\n5. Marketers Will Use More Short-Form Videos in Social Media Ad Campaigns\n\nIn 2024, spending on short-form videos for advertising was estimated to reach almost $100 billion.\n\nThat’s likely because short-form videos are generally more engaging. And are highly shareable.\n\nVideos under 60 seconds have a 50% average engagement rate. While videos longer than 60 minutes have a 16% average engagement rate.\n\nThis signals an opportunity for marketers to reach more people. With paid social campaigns and product ads using TikTok or YouTube Shorts.\n\nFind inspiration for short-form video topics using the Keyword Analytics for YouTube app.\n\nOpen the tool and click “Get started” under “Keywords Research.”\n\nThen, enter a keyword related to your brand, industry, or market in the search bar and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see a list of related terms and relevant information, including the top videos.\n\nLook for keywords with a high search volume and a low competitive rate. Then, target them using short-form video content.\n\n6. Brands Will Use Values-Driven Marketing to Show Commitment to Environmental or Societal Causes\n\nConsumers often prefer brands that share their values.\n\nIn fact, 78% of consumers said they made a purchase decision based on a brand’s values. And 55% said they are much more likely to buy from companies that reflect their beliefs.\n\nAnd more than 80% of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainably sourced and produced goods.\n\nThis means brands can benefit from using values-driven marketing to resonate better with potential customers and foster loyalty among their target market.\n\nHere are examples of values-driven marketing in action:\n\nEcologyst shows its commitment to sustainability by creating an Instagram Story highlight about its sustainability efforts.\n\nAnd Adidas’ “Breaking Barriers” campaign highlights its commitment to improving access to sports for women and girls in Europe. \n\n7. Social Commerce Will Drive Greater Conversions for Ecommerce Brands\n\nSocial commerce is the process of selling products directly on social media. It creates a seamless, convenient, and interactive shopping experience. \n\nPlatforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube integrate shopping features directly into their platforms. Meaning people can purchase products without having to leave social media.\n\nThis ensures users stay on the platform through the entire journey—from product discovery to checkout. Which can lower the risk of cart abandonment.\n\nThe best part?\n\nSocial commerce accounted for 18.5% of online sales in 2023. And is predicted to be a $100 billion industry by 2025 because of its ease of use and frictionless checkout. \n\nImage Source: eMarketer\n\nIn practice, social commerce can mean partnering with influencers to create engaging, short-form videos. Your target audience can then interact with these videos to purchase featured products in a few clicks.\n\nIt can also mean integrating shoppable products into carousel ads to drive purchases from your social media posts.\n\n8. Marketers Will Focus on Creating Personalized Content with AI\n\nMarketers who created personalized customer experiences were 215% more likely to say their strategies in 2023 were successful.\n\nAnd 77% of marketers who used generative AI said it helped with creating personalized content.\n\nFor example, AI-powered tools like Peak can accurately segment audiences. Which allows marketers to analyze their users’ habits and preferences. And craft highly relevant emails, blog posts, or social ads.\n\nAnd ContentShake AI uses Semrush’s SEO data to craft content that targets keywords your audience is searching for.\n\nEven chatbots are evolving. Conversational chatbots like Drift use AI to offer instant, personalized recommendations during customer interactions. Making the experience feel more tailored.\n\nAs AI tools become more sophisticated, personalized content will continue to be a key strategy in improving customer experiences and driving business growth.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Market Explorer to learn more about your target audience’s demographics, socioeconomics, interests, and more. So you can create content they’re interested in.\n \n\n9. Marketers Will Increase Focus on First-Party Data\n\nIn light of growing privacy concerns and shifting regulations, marketers are increasingly prioritizing first-party data over third-party data to drive their marketing campaigns.\n\nBut what are first-party and third-party data?\n\nFirst-party data is data that you collect directly from your users through interactions like website visits, purchases, and signups. This information is stored within your organization and is rarely shared with external parties.\nThird-party data, on the other hand, is data you obtain from external organizations (usually data brokers) that collect and aggregate data from multiple sources. In some cases, users don’t consent to their information being shared. \n\nOne of the biggest drivers behind the shift to first-party data is the growing consumer demand for privacy.\n\nAround a third of consumers said they care about their data privacy and want more control over their personal data. These consumers are also willing to take action or have already taken action to protect their online data.\n\nIn addition to that, more governments have introduced stricter privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU. And the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\n\nThis growing demand for privacy has marketers turning away from relying on third-party data. Only 49% of marketers still rely on third-party data, down from 75% in 2022.\n\nHere are some ways you can collect first-party data:\n\nTrack website analytics. Use Google Analytics to track audience behavior on your website. Collect data on page views, click-through rates, and user journeys to understand customer interests and preferences.\nCollect customer feedback. Gather feedback through satisfaction surveys, product reviews, and customer support interactions.\nBuild loyalty programs. Use loyalty programs that collect data on customer purchase history, frequency, and preferences. Use this data to reward and engage loyal customers.\nDeploy sign-up forms. Encourage your audience to sign up for newsletters or register for webinars. Then, collect information such as email addresses, job titles, and preferences. \n\nFurther reading: What Is a Data Strategy, and How Do You Create One?\n\n10. Brands Will Focus on Immersive VR Experiences to Engage Audiences\n\nVirtual and augmented reality have the potential to add around £1.4 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\n\nAnd with the launch of virtual reality headsets from companies such as Meta and Apple, this signals new opportunities for marketers to provide immersive brand experiences, such as: \n\nVirtual product demonstrations and try-ons\nVirtual showrooms and product displays\nVirtual brand storytelling \nInteractive games and branded VR challenges\nVirtual tours and travel experiences\n\nThese strategies can create memorable experiences, provoke emotion, and give you an edge over competitors in your industry.\n\nKeep Up with New Technology and Trends Using Semrush Tools\n\nKeeping up with marketing trends can be a lot of work. But tools can help you keep up with the times while minimizing effort.\n\nFor example, integrating AI into your content workflow is easy with ContentShake AI. The tool gives you SEO ideas, generates fully optimized articles, and lets you publish content. All using one platform.\n\nAnd creating personalized content is easy with tools like Market Explorer and One2Target that tell you more about your target audience.
