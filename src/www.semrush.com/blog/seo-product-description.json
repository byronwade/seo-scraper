  "content": "What Is an SEO Product Description?\n\nAn SEO product description is written content that’s designed to inform shoppers about a product, convert shoppers into customers, and increase the product’s visibility in unpaid search results. Ecommerce sites can use SEO product descriptions on product pages to rank higher for relevant keywords in Google.\n\nFor example, here’s a product description from Hydro Flask:\n\nThis helps the page rank for keywords like “64 oz water bottle”:\n\nThis keyword alone gets 9,900 searches per month, according to Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool. And it has commercial search intent (i.e., users are doing research before making a purchase decision).\n\nSo, you can see the value in doing SEO for product pages.\n\nYou can also use SEO product descriptions in other locations, such as:\n\nOnline marketplaces: Adding optimized descriptions to listings can help you rank higher on Amazon and other marketplaces. And get your third-party product pages ranked on Google.\nSocial media platforms: Some social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, allow you to create product catalogs. SEO descriptions can help your products get discovered through search.\nGoogle Merchant Center: Effective product feed descriptions can improve performance of your Google Shopping ads. And help you get free product listings on Google surfaces.\n\nCollect Keyword Data\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Write SEO Product Descriptions\n\nLearn how to write a product description that generates organic traffic and conversions.\n\nHere are seven best practices:\n\n1. Optimize for Target Keywords\n\nWhen doing SEO for products, target keywords are search queries you want to rank for.\n\nUsing target keywords in product descriptions can help you rank higher in search results. Because it helps prove your product is relevant to the user.\n\nTo find what people search on Google, perform keyword research with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a word or phrase related to your product. \n\nThen, choose your country and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see keywords that contain your starting term(s) or a close variation.\n\nTo focus on keywords that people use while shopping, filter for transactional search intent.\n\nLike this:\n\nIf you’re optimizing your product feed, filter for keywords that trigger product listing ads. And other Google Shopping-related SERP features.\n\nLike this:\n\nOnce you’ve finished applying filters, choose target keywords. Making sure your product matches what the searcher is looking for.\n\nGenerally, more specific keywords are better for SEO product descriptions. Even though their search volumes (average number of monthly searches) are likely to be lower.\n\nWhy?\n\nLong-tail keywords tend to have lower keyword difficulty scores (KD %). Meaning it’s easier to rank on Google’s first page.\n\nPlus, specific keywords attract highly targeted traffic. Meaning your sales conversion rate should be higher.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nWho’s more likely to buy a 64oz stainless steel water bottle: Someone who searches for that exact thing, or someone who searches “water bottles”?\n\nWhatever keywords you choose, incorporate them naturally.\n\nDon’t write something like this:\n\n\"Stay hydrated with our 64oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle, your ultimate hydration partner! This 64oz stainless steel water bottle, made from quality stainless steel, is the water bottle for all your hydration needs. Forget about other water bottles, this stainless steel bottle with a 64oz capacity keeps your water cool all day. If you're in search of a water bottle, then our 64oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle, featuring stainless steel construction, is the best water bottle choice for you.\"\n\nForcing keywords into your SEO product descriptions is a practice known as keyword stuffing. It’s against Google’s spam policies. And it can put potential customers off, too.\n\nTip: Find keywords for your Amazon product descriptions with the Keyword Wizard for Amazon.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Adopt the Right Tone of Voice\n\nTone of voice refers to the personality behind your brand’s writing. \n\nChoosing the right tone of voice—and using it consistently—helps you build a brand identity. And engage your target audience.\n\nSo, it’s important that it shines through in your SEO optimized product descriptions.\n\nFor example, Firebox uses humor to emphasize the quirkiness of its products:\n\nWhile Nike empowers audiences with strong and confident language:\n\nFor help with tone of voice, use Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nThe tool analyzes your text in real time. And highlights sentences that are too casual or formal, based on your target tone.\n\nThe SEO Writing Assistant also scores your originality, readability, and SEO. \n\nIf you need help rephrasing or composing content, take advantage of the Smart Writer tools. \n\nGet Writing Recommendations\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Prove Your Product’s Value\n\nTo persuade people to buy your product, you need to show the value that’s in it for them.\n\nSo, use these tips when writing product descriptions:\n\nTranslate Features into Benefits\n\nIt’s important to explain the benefit behind each product feature.\n\nFor example, people don’t really care that this Dyson vacuum cleaner has nylon bristles. But they do care that those bristles “remove stubborn dirt and pet hair from carpets and rugs.”\n\nUse Lifestyle Copywriting\n\nLifestyle copywriting is about selling the experiences a product can offer.\n\nIt paints a picture of a life the target audience desires. To tap into their aspirations and emotions. And, ultimately, prompt purchases.\n\nLet’s say you’re writing an SEO product description for hiking boots.\n\nAs well as talking about features and benefits, you could talk about adventures in the wilderness. Fun days out with the family. Or whatever appeals to your target audience.\n\nIf you haven’t already, create buyer personas (profiles that represent each type of target customer).\n\nThroughout this process, you’ll define your target customers’ goals, values, and pain points. And document them for easy reference.\n\nHere’s an example created with the Semrush Persona tool:\n\nSupport Your Claims\n\nWhen making claims about your product, you need to back them up. In order to build trust with your potential customers.\n\nMany marketers fall into the trap of making generic and unsubstantiated claims—for example, saying that a product is “easy to use.”\n\nInstead, explain how to use the product. And let readers come to that conclusion themselves.\n\nFacts and figures can also inspire confidence in your products.\n\nFor example, here’s part of Amazon’s product description for the Kindle Paperwhite:\n\n\"Kindle Paperwhite is IPX8 rated to protect against accidental immersion in up to two meters of fresh water for up to 60 minutes, and up to 0.25 meters of seawater for up to 3 minutes.\"\n\n4. Improve Readability\n\nMake your SEO product descriptions easy to read. So that shoppers can find and absorb information more easily. \n\nHere are a few simple tips you can use:\n\nUse proper spellings and grammar (tools like Grammarly can help)\nReplace complex words with short, familiar words\nRemove unnecessary words to keep your writing concise\nKeep sentences short (under 20 words)\nAvoid the passive voice\nBreak up text using line spaces, headers, bullet points, etc.\n\nWondering how long a product description should be?\n\nGet a recommended text length and readability score for your product page with Semrush’s SEO Content Template.\n\nEnter your target keyword(s), choose your location and device, then click “Create content template.”\n\nThe tool will analyze your top 10 Google rivals. And build a content brief accordingly.\n\nScroll down to the “Key recommendations” section:\n\nSee how competitors use your target keywords, too. \n\nThese SEO description examples can help you write your own content. And optimize it effectively.\n\nWhen you’ve finished reviewing your brief, go back to the top of the page. Where you’ll find various options:\n\nOrder content writing: Send the brief to a professional writer\nExport to DOC: Save your brief as a .docx file\nReal-time Content Check: Use your brief in the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nGet Product Page Suggestions\n\nwith the SEO Content Template Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n5. Use AI to Your Advantage\n\nAI copywriting tools can make it quicker to write SEO product descriptions.\n\nFor example, the AI Writing Assistant has tools for:\n\nAmazon Product Descriptions\nEcommerce Description Bullet Points\nEcommerce Product Names\nEcommerce Product Descriptions\nProduct Descriptions\n\nSign up for your free 7-day trial and choose the tool you’d like to use.\n\nThen, fill out the form and choose the number of results you want.\n\nClick “Generate” when you’re done.\n\nChoose your favorite result. And click “Check Plagiarism” to ensure the text is original.\n\nYou can then copy or save your product description.\n\nWhatever AI tool you use, it’s crucial to fact-check your content before publishing.\n\nAnd for the best results, make other improvements manually. Based on the tips in this guide. \n\nThe more you tailor your SEO product descriptions to your brand and target audience, the better their results should be.\n\nTip: For similar reasons, avoid using fill-in-the-blanks product description templates. Boilerplate content offers less value to the reader and may harm your SEO.\n\n6. Add Structured Data\n\nIf you add structured data (or schema markup) to your product pages, Google can create rich snippets.\n\nThese are enhanced search results. Which can drive more traffic to your site.\n\nFor example, the result below includes the product’s rating and price. As well as weight and height information. All thanks to product structured data.\n\nTo get started, go to Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper.\n\nSelect “Products.”\n\nThen, enter your product page URL and click “Start Tagging.”\n\nNext, highlight your SEO product description and click “Description.”\n\nRepeat this process to tag other elements. Including the product name, price, and aggregate rating.\n\nWhen you’re finished, click “CREATE HTML.”\n\nThen, click “Finish” and follow the instructions provided.\n\nOnce your page is updated, check everything’s working with Google’s Rich Results Test.\n\nTip: Product SEO goes far beyond descriptions. For more advice, learn about SEO for landing pages.\n\n7. Include Useful Information\n\nGive shoppers all the information they might need to make a purchasing decision.\n\nProduct descriptions should include features, benefits, and technical specifications. But the best descriptions can also include usage and maintenance instructions, packaging and environmental information, FAQs, comparison tables, testimonials, and more.\n\nHere are some other elements to include on your product pages:\n\nCall to action buttons (e.g., “Buy Now”)\nProduct images and videos\nPricing and special offers\nDelivery and returns information\nStock availability\nLinks to related products or categories\nCustomer reviews\nAwards and accolades\nSocial sharing buttons\nLive chat\n\nAmazon, Apple, and Walmart are the biggest retail sites in search, according to the Semrush Rank for February 2024. So, try looking at their sites for product SEO examples.\n\nHow to Hire a Professional Writer\n\nIf you’re short on time or want better results, consider hiring a professional writer for your SEO product descriptions.\n\nOn Semrush’s Content Marketplace, you can order product descriptions in minutes.
