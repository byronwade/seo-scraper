  "content": "What Is Organic Traffic in Google Analytics 4?\n\nOrganic traffic refers to website visits that come from organic (unpaid) search results. \n\nWhen someone looks up “how to make vegan pasta” using a search engine and clicks on the link to go to a website, this counts as organic traffic.\n\nThe main difference between direct and organic traffic in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the referral source. \n\n“A session is processed as direct traffic when no information about the referral source is available, or when the referring source or search term has been configured to be ignored,” according to Google.\n\nIn other words, direct traffic doesn’t have a referral source. But organic traffic does.\n\nGA4 tracks organic traffic from numerous search engines, including Google and Bing. Which you can see in the report below (check the “Session source” column):\n\nOrganic traffic is important because:\n\nIt increases brand awareness\nIt grows conversions like signing up for a newsletter or buying a product\nIt allows you to reach a wide audience\n\nPlus, organic traffic is free. \n\nBut this comes with a caveat. \n\nYou need to first implement organic SEO techniques—including keyword research, on-page optimization, and much more—to attract organic traffic. And these efforts require time and money if you want to execute them well.\n\nBut once you do rank at the top of the search results, you can expect a steady stream of traffic to your website for months or even years. So, your efforts will likely pay off.\n\nOrganic Traffic in GA4 vs. Organic Traffic in Universal Analytics\n\nUniversal Analytics (UA) was the previous version of Google Analytics. And it was incredibly popular among marketers. \n\nBut on July 1, 2023, all UA properties stopped processing data. This marked the official shift from UA to GA4.\n\nThere are many differences between GA4 and UA. And they also apply to organic traffic and metrics you’ll use to analyze it.\n\nLet’s start by comparing the differences between key metrics in GA4 and UA.\n\nUsers\n\n\t\n\nUA had just “Total Users” and “New Users.” GA4 includes an “Active Users” metric, which refers to users who had an engaged session on your website—meaning your site was their primary focus.\n\n\n\n\nPageviews\n\n\t\n\nUA had “Pageviews” and “Unique Pageviews” as metrics. GA4 only has “Views.” This metric refers to the number of webpages/screens users viewed, including repeat views.\n\n\n\n\nSessions\n\n\t\n\nUA measured “Sessions” (a metric that starts when a user opens a page on your site and ends after 30 minutes of inactivity). And all sessions restarted at midnight. (A new session began if a user was using your website at midnight.) \n\nGA4 also uses this metric but doesn’t restart them at midnight. It also doesn’t trigger a new session when it spots new campaign parameters.\n\n\n\n\nConversions\n\n\t\n\nUA had “Goals” to track user actions and counted one conversion per session for each goal. So, if a user completed the same goal multiple times during a session, it would count as one conversion. \n\nGA4 uses “Conversion events” to track conversions and will typically count multiple conversions within the same session.\n\n\n\n\nBounce rate\n\n\t\n\nIn UA, “Bounce rate” refers to the percentage of sessions when users saw only one page and didn’t trigger any other events. Like clicking on a link.\n\nIn GA4, this metric refers to sessions that don’t count as engaged sessions. An engaged session lasts more than 10 seconds, creates one or more conversions, or leads to two or more screen or page views.\n\nThere are also significant differences between the user interfaces of UA and GA4.\n\nHere’s what a basic organic traffic report looked like in UA:\n\nAnd here’s the corresponding report in GA4:\n\nIf you’re used to UA, it might take a bit of a learning curve to become comfortable with the reports in GA4.\n\nLet’s start by going over where to find the correct traffic report in GA4. And how to isolate organic search traffic.\n\nHow to Find Organic Traffic in Google Analytics 4\n\nTo find organic search traffic metrics in Google Analytics 4, go to the main dashboard and click on “Reports” in the left-hand menu.\n\nThis will take you to a “Reports snapshot” dashboard. \n\nNext, go to the “Life cycle” section, then click “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”\n\nThe “Traffic acquisition” report contains all the data on your website traffic. Including traffic from organic search, direct, and organic social. \n\nPro tip\n\nRemember to set your desired start and end date for the report (in the upper right corner) to make sure you’re viewing the right data.\n\nWhen you scroll down, you’ll see more traffic data broken down by channel.\n\nFrom here, we need to apply a filter to isolate organic search traffic. This is an important step because it allows you to apply additional filters later on that will consider only organic traffic data.\n\nClick on “Add filter +,” which will pull up the “Build filter” menu.\n\nThen, set the following conditions:\n\nSelect “Session default channel group” under “Dimension”\nSelect “exactly matches” under “Match Type”\nSelect “Organic Search” under “Value”\n\nThen, click “Apply” to filter the report.\n\nNow, you’ve successfully isolated your website’s organic search traffic data. And the report will look something like this:\n\nThis is a basic report that doesn’t give you any in-depth insights. So, you need to use additional features to analyze the data. We’ll cover this next.\n\nHow to Analyze Organic Traffic Data in GA4 with Dimensions and Metrics\n\nIn GA4, dimensions refer to data attributes like geographical location or the landing page of a user session. You can use these dimensions to display more information about your organic traffic.\n\nTip\n\nFor a complete list of GA4 dimensions and metrics, head to Google’s metrics and dimensions page.\n\nBefore following along with the examples below, make sure to complete the steps in the previous section so you’re only analyzing organic traffic data.\n\n1. Identify Your Top-Performing Pages\n\nGA4 allows you to find which pages on your website are receiving the most traffic from organic search. \n\nWe can do this using the “Landing page” dimension. This will break down the report into rows showing which pages users first visit during their sessions.\n\nHere’s how to find your top landing pages.\n\nIn the traffic acquisition report, scroll down to the table and click on the “+” next to “Session default channel group.”\n\nClick on “Page / screen” > “Landing page + query string.”\n\nYou’ll now see a list of your most visited pages from organic search.\n\nThe report orders the pages according to the number of users. (Note the arrow next to “Users.”) \n\nYou can order them based on other columns. Like by clicking “Sessions.”\n\nYou can also export this report (and any others you generate) by clicking the share button in the top-right corner.\n\nClick “Download File.”\n\nThen, choose your preferred file format.\n\n2. Measure Organic Traffic Changes Over Time\n\nIn GA4, you can compare organic traffic data from different periods. \n\nThis helps you understand how pages have performed in search over time. And you can see if some are experiencing a traffic increase or decrease.\n\nMany marketers analyze this data to see whether a page is due for a refresh. And to report on the progress of their SEO efforts. \n\nYou can also use this feature to find out if a Google search algorithm update has impacted your website.\n\nTo analyze this data, click the date tab in the upper right corner.\n\nTurn on the “Compare” option and select the periods you want to compare. GA will automatically suggest a couple of options, but you can also customize the selection. \n\nWhen you’ve chosen your dates, click “Apply.”\n\nThe new report includes data from both periods. Any increases or decreases are expressed in percentages.\n\nBut what if you’re only interested in data on a specific page or a subset of pages?\n\nIn that case, enter the URL slug into the search bar.\n\nThe report will now display only the data for this group of pages. So you can easily pull data on the organic traffic performance of your blog, product pages, or any other part of your website.\n\n3. Understand Your Visitors’ Locations\n\nGA4 collects user location data, which allows you to see where your website visitors are coming from. \n\nBy analyzing this data, you’ll notice if your brand is getting more attention in some locations. Then, you can launch more paid ads targeting people in that area or create content that speaks to their interests.\n\nHere’s how to filter your organic traffic data by location.\n\nClick on the “+” next to “Session default channel group.”\n\nClick “Geography,” then select one of the three options. For this example, we’ll use “Country.”\n\nThe report will display all the countries where users visited your website via organic search. \n\nYou can use metrics like “Engaged sessions” and “Average engagement time per session” to analyze how visitors in different locations respond to your website. \n\nGA counts a session as engaged if it lasts more than 10 seconds, includes a conversion, or has a minimum of two page views. Average engagement time measures how long your website was the main focus of a visitor’s browser.\n\nWe can take this analysis one step further. \n\nLet’s say you want to see which landing pages get the most organic traffic in Canada.\n\nHere’s how to find this data.\n\nScroll to the top of the report and click on the first filter we applied to isolate organic traffic: “Session default channel group exactly matches ‘Organic Search’.”\n\nWe need to expand this filter and isolate organic traffic from Canada. To do so, click “+ Add new condition.”\n\nThen, we select the following:\n\nChoose “Country” under “Dimension”\nChoose “exactly matches” under “Match Type”\nChoose “Canada” under “Value”\n\nAnd click “Apply.”\n\nNow, scroll to the bottom of the report and apply a dimension filter by clicking “Page / screen” > “Landing page + query string.” (You’ll need to remove the “Country” column from earlier by clicking the “X” next to it.)\n\nThe finished report displays only the top landing pages in Canada.\n\n4. Measure How Organic Traffic Impacts Conversions\n\nAs any marketer will tell you, measuring the impact of organic traffic on conversions is essential to proving the value of your marketing efforts. \n\nNote\n\nTo follow along with this example, you need to set up conversion events in GA4. If you don’t know how to do that, follow the steps in this Google guide.\n\nFor example, you might want to know which pages drive a particular type of conversion from organic traffic.\n\nScroll down to the table in the report and set the secondary dimension to “Page / screen” > “Landing page + query string.”\n\nThen, find the “Conversions” column by scrolling to the right. \n\nUnder “Conversions,” click “All events.” Then, select the event you want to pull up the data for. Such as “view_item.”\n\nThe table will display how many “view_item” conversion events were driven by organic visits to specific landing pages.\n\n5. Discover Keywords That Drive Organic Traffic\n\nWhen you connect your GA4 account to Google Search Console (GSC), you can see which keywords send users to your website.\n\nYou can follow Google’s documentation on integrating GSC with GA4 to link your accounts.\n\nNote\n\nTo connect GSC and GA4, you need to have editor status in GA4 and be the verified owner of the GSC property.\n\nNow, it’s time to add your GSC data to a GA4 report that you can easily access.\n\nOpen GA and click on “Reports.”\n\nThen, go to “Library.”\n\nFind “Search Console” in the “Collections” section. \n\nClick on the three-dot icon to open the menu. Then click “Publish.”\n\nThe “Search Console” report should immediately appear in the left-hand menu.\n\nFinally, we can click on “Search Console” > “Queries” to see all the search queries that led users to your website.\n\nThe report displays clicks from Google Search over time. And a chart containing the top queries.\n\nScroll down to discover the complete query list and metrics associated with each. Including clicks, impressions, and click-through rate.\n\nThese queries can help you better measure the success of your SEO efforts. And also serve as great starting points for additional keyword research. \n\nHow to Improve Your SEO with Insights from Organic Traffic\n\nOrganic traffic data allows you to analyze your SEO performance and find ways to improve.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nCreate More High-Performing Content\n\nOrganic traffic data from GA4 helps you identify which types of content attract the most visitors or engaged sessions. And then create similar content to attract even more visitors.\n\nThis SEO technique allows you to quickly come up with new content ideas. \n\nFor example, consider adding more guides to your content calendar if the top 10 pages on your blog are mostly in-depth guides.\n\nAnother way to find content ideas tailored to your audience is through competitor research—a popular tip for improving SEO that also uses organic traffic.\n\nAlthough you can’t access a competitor’s GA account to see their traffic data, you can use a tool like Organic Research to find their top-performing pages.\n\nEnter your competitor’s website URL into the search bar, select your location, and click “Search.”\n\nClick on the “Pages” tab.\n\nNow, you can see which competitor pages get the most organic traffic.\n\nAnalyze each page to understand what contributes to its performance. Maybe your competitor is using original research, images, or even videos to elevate its content.\n\nPro tip\n\nFor a deep dive into your competitors’ advantages and weak points, check out Semrush’s Domain Overview tool.\n\nIf you choose to cover one of these topics, remember that it’s not enough just to mimic your competitor’s content. (Without plagiarizing, of course.) Offer original insights or a unique take.\n\nThis will help you create quality content and increase organic traffic.\n\nIdentify Pages That Need Updating\n\nGA4 enables you to easily discover which pages have been losing organic traffic. When you combine this with keyword ranking data, you can pinpoint pages that could be due for a refresh.\n\nIt’s important to use keyword ranking data whenever you’re identifying pages to update. Because a page could see less traffic for different reasons. \n\nFor example, some keywords could have a higher search volume during certain times of the year. So, the decreased traffic could be caused by a lower search volume and not poor rankings.\n\nHere’s how to find out whether a page has experienced any significant position changes.\n\nOpen the Position Tracking tool and enter the name of your domain. \n\nThen, click “Set up tracking.”\n\nSelect the search engine, device type, and location that you want to gather data for. And click “Continue To Keywords” when you’re done.\n\nThen, enter the keywords that you want to track your rankings for. You can also import them from a CSV or text file, Google Analytics, or another campaign. Or you can use Semrush suggestions.\n\nWhen you’ve entered your keywords, click “Add keywords to campaign.” \n\nThen, select “Start Tracking.”\n\nWhen the project is generated, go to the “Pages” tab.\n\nThis tab contains all the URLs that rank for the keywords you entered when you set up the position tracking campaign.\n\nIn the “Average position” column, you’ll see how your rankings have changed. For example, the URL with the slug “ai-art-generator” has improved its rankings by 58 positions compared to the previous period.\n\nIf you notice that one of your pages has lost rankings, analyze the search engine results of the target keyword to see what kind of content Google prioritizes. \n\nFor example, you could discover that most top-ranking pages now include user reviews. You could update your page to include reviews and monitor your rankings to see if there are any improvements.\n\nDiscover More Keywords to Increase Your Search Visibility\n\nWhen you connect GSC and GA4, you can see the search queries that lead users to your website in one dashboard. And you can use these queries to find more organic keywords to target.\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool is a great way to find new search terms. \n\nLet’s say your website receives a lot of traffic from the keyword “thin hair.”\n\nEnter this keyword and click “Search.”\n\nFrom here, you can apply different filters to narrow down your search. They include search volume, Keyword Difficulty (a measure of how difficult it is to rank in the top 10 for a given keyword), and search intent (the reason behind a user’s query). \n\nAnd you’re able to exclude (or include) certain keywords from your list.\n\nTake the Next Step in Your SEO Efforts\n\nMeasuring organic traffic in Google Analytics is an important step. \n\nBut actually growing organic traffic needs a multi-pronged approach. Because multiple factors play into your search performance. \n\nThankfully, monitoring these factors doesn’t have to be complex.\n\nSemrush’s Project Dashboard provides the most important search visibility data in one place. So you can stay informed, find opportunities, and manage any issues that arise.\n\nAnalyze Your SEO Performance in One Place\n\nwith Project Dashboard\n\nSign up Now →",
