  "content": "What Are Long-Tail Keywords?\n\nLong-tail keywords are highly specific search queries that tend to have relatively low search volumes. \n\nAlthough users search for them less often, long-tail keywords make up a large percentage of overall searches when added together. \n\nAnd because they’re more specific than other keywords, searchers who use them may be more likely to convert (make a purchase, fill out a form, contact you, etc.).\n\nThe term “long tail” refers to the “tail” at the end of the search demand curve. \n\nCheck out the search demand curve chart below. Each individual long-tail keyword has a relatively low search volume (especially when compared to head terms.) \n\nBut in aggregate, they actually make up the vast majority of all searches performed on Google.\n\nLong-Tail Keyword Examples\n\nLet’s quickly take a look at examples of words that don’t qualify as long-tail keywords.\n\nHere are examples of very broad “head terms” that aren’t long-tail keywords:\n\nCoffee filters\nIced coffee\nMarketing agency\nMarketing software\n\nSee how these terms are short and not very specific? Long-tail terms tend to be longer and more specific.\n\nThe non-long-tail terms above also have relatively high search volumes, according to Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool.\n\nSo they’re definitely not long-tail keywords.\n\nHere are some examples of targeted keywords that are long-tail keywords: \n\nHomemade coffee filters\nCan you warm up iced coffee\nMarketing agency for SaaS\nEnterprise marketing software\n\nSee how these keywords are long and specific? Those are telltale signs of long-tail keywords.\n\nPlus, they also have relatively low search volumes, as you can see in the report below. \n\nCheck the Search Volume of Any Keyword\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nWhy Are Long-Tail Keywords Important?\nEasier to Rank\n\nPopular head terms are typically very competitive. Which means it can take years to rank for that keyword with SEO (if you’re able to rank at all).\n\nFor example, if we analyze the keyword “sushi” in Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool, it tells us how difficult ranking for that keyword is going to be.\n\nThe tool uses the Keyword Difficulty (KD) metric to report a keyword’s ranking difficulty.\n\n“Sushi” has a KD of 93%.\n\nSo it’s really tough to rank for this term.\n\nBut the long-tail keyword “sushi sandwich recipe” has a keyword difficulty of 27%.\n\nSo, this long-tail keyword is relatively easier to rank for than a related head term.\n\nTargeted Traffic\n\nBecause long-tail keywords tend to be very specific, the average person searching that keyword in Google is probably close to making a purchase. Or otherwise converting.\n\nFor example, take the keyword “SEO software for small business”:\n\nSomeone searching for that term is pretty close to making a buying decision. So, if you are in the SEO software space and you rank highly for this keyword, searchers might just buy from you.\n\nOn the other hand, a keyword like “SEO” is super broad:\n\nThis searcher is likely doing some preliminary research about SEO in general. They may be months away from looking for software to help with their SEO strategy.\n\nSo even if you rank for this term, it’s unlikely to bring many conversions.\n\nLess Expensive Pay Per Click (PPC) Advertising\n\nIf you use Google Ads, long-tail keywords can also help you get more bang for your advertising buck. \n\nWhy? Generally, high-volume keywords have a high cost per click (CPC). \n\nPlus, as we just pointed out, these types of broad keywords don’t even convert super well. \n\nHowever, low-volume long-tail keywords are super targeted. Which means they can have a higher conversion rate. \n\nPlus, they can have a lower CPC. That’s a PPC win-win! \n\nThe main downside of focusing on long-tail keywords? You need several of them to equal the amount of traffic you could get from a single head term. \n\nEasy to Target\n\nBecause long-tail keywords are highly specific, they’re often easier to target with pages on your site.\n\nTake the keyword “how to filter cold brew coffee.”\n\nIf you look at the top ranking-pages for this keyword in Google, they are all blog posts teaching you how to filter cold brew coffee.\n\nSo if you were to target this keyword, it’s pretty obvious that you'll also need to create a blog post. And the blog post should teach readers how to filter cold brew coffee.\n\nOn the flip side, a non-long-tail keyword like “coffee grinder” is super broad.\n\nIf you see the top-ranking pages for this keyword, you’ll notice both ecommerce category pages and informative blog posts ranking.\n\nLooking at the search results, it’s not clear whether you should target this keyword with a blog post about best coffee grinders or an ecommerce category page showing all the coffee grinders you sell.\n\nMore Choice\n\nLong-tail keywords make up the majority of search queries in Google.\n\nWhen people search for information or products online, they are more likely to use longer, more descriptive phrases that reflect their specific needs or interests.\n\nFor example, instead of searching for “shoes,” someone might search for “comfortable running shoes for women with flat feet.”\n\nOr “basketball shoes for ankle support.”\n\nOr thousand other long-tail variations that reflect their specific needs.\n\nSo you’ll likely never run out of long-tail keyword ideas to target with your site.\n\nHow to Identify Long-Tail Keywords\n\nHere are a few proven strategies for finding long-tail keywords for your website.\n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool generates thousands of long-tail keywords in seconds. It is one of the best tools for performing long-tail keyword research.\n\nType a broad “seed keyword” into the tool.\n\n(Seed keywords are short phrases or single words most related to your business. They’re helpful for generating more keyword ideas and finding long-tail keywords.)\n\nThe tool will quickly kick back different variations of your seed keyword.\n\nIf you look at the first few keywords, they all have high search volume and ranking difficulty.\n\nSo these are definitely not long-tail keywords.\n\nWe can narrow down the list and add a KD filter to only show keywords that have low ranking difficulty. In other words, long-tail keywords.\n\nClick on the “KD” drop-down from the top and select “Easy.”\n\nNow, you’ll see lots of long-tail keyword ideas.\n\nWant to try it yourself? Sign up for a free Semrush account:\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →\nPerform Keyword Gap Analysis\n\nKeyword gap analysis can help you find long-tail keywords that your competitors rank for, but you don’t. \n\nAny long-tail SEO keywords your competitors are targeting are likely to be relevant to your business, too.\n\nSo targeting those keywords with your own website makes sense.\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Gap tool can uncover your competitors’ long-tail keywords.\n\nOpen the tool. Add your domain and up to four competitors. Then click “Compare.”\n\nThe tool will show you keywords that your competitors rank for, along with the ranking position, keyword search volume, and keyword difficulty.\n\nAs you can see, all these keywords are super broad and very popular.\n\nSo you need to apply some filters to narrow down your results to only show specific long-tail keywords.\n\nHere are the filters you can apply:\n\nSearch volume: To filter for keywords that have lower search volume\nKD: To filter for keywords with low keyword difficulty\nPosition: To filter for keywords where your competitors rank in the first 20 positions\n\nAfter applying some filters, you’ll see long-tail keywords you can target with your own website.\n\nTry Google Search Features\n\nWhen you start typing into Google’s search box, Google’s autocomplete feature will show you a drop-down list of related terms that people search for: \n\nYou can also add a letter after your search term to see even more suggestions. \n\nFor example, let’s say you’re looking for long-tail keywords related to content marketing. You can type something like “best content marketing p” into the search box and get the following list of suggestions:\n\nNote: Autocomplete suggestions will not always be long-tail keywords. Often, they will be highly competitive terms that don’t quite fit the definition of “long-tail.”\n\nSo always analyze these keywords in Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool to check whether they’re really long-tail keywords or not.\n\nFor example, if we analyze the keyword “best content marketing podcasts,” we see that it has a low search volume and low keyword difficulty. It’s also longer and highly specific.\n\nSo, it’s a long-tail keyword.\n\nAlso, Google provides a list of eight keywords at the bottom of the first page of the search results:\n\nThese are usually keywords closely related to the term you just searched for.\n\nMost of these won’t always be long-tail keywords. Because Google’s related searches show you popular keywords people search for. The same is true for autocomplete suggestions.\n\nSo analyze your keywords in Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool before deciding to target them with your site.\n\nIn addition to Google autocomplete and related searches, you could also use Google’s People Also Ask box to find long-tail keywords.\n\nThe related questions section could be an excellent source of question-based long-tail keywords: \n\nAnd when you click to expand on a question, Google generates even more related questions:\n\nAgain, remember to check all these keywords in Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool.\n\nThe search volume and keyword difficulty metric should help you confirm whether the keyword is really a long-tail search.\n\nUse Semrush Topic Research Tool\n\nThe Topic Research tool will help you find topics closely related to a keyword that you type into it: \n\nMany of these topics, which are displayed in card-style format, show questions related to your topic.\n\nSome of these questions can make for great long-tail keyword ideas that are ideal for blog content.\n\nJust cross-check by putting these question keywords into the Keyword Overview tool. One by one.\n\nThe “Search Volume” and “Keyword Difficulty” metric should help you make the final call.\n\nLeverage Forum Sites\n\nMessage boards and forum sites like Quora can help you find long-tail keyword ideas.\n\nPlug their domain into Semrush’s Organic Research tool and hit “Search.”\n\nThen go to the “Positions” tab. This shows all the keywords that they rank for in Google. (In this case, over 37M.)\n\nBut the keywords you’ll see may not be relevant to your business.\n\nTo find the keywords that are related to your business, filter the report to only see keywords that represent your niche.\n\nFor example, if you’re in the finance niche, you can filter the report to show keywords that include the word “finance” in them.\n\nNavigate to “Advanced filters,” type “finance,” and click “Apply.” \n\nThen, you’ll have a more focused list of keywords. Including some long-tail variations.\n\nLike “is international finance hard” and “is finance a stem major.\"\n\nFind Long-tail Keywords\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nTry Google Ads Keyword Planner\n\nThe Google Keyword Planner is designed for PPC campaigns. That said, it’s still a helpful source of keyword ideas. \n\nTo use it, log in to your Google Ads account and head over to the Keyword Planner. \n\nYou’ll see two options: “Discover new keywords” and “Get search volume and forecasts:”\n\nSelect “Discover new keywords”:\n\nThen, enter a broad “seed keyword” into the field. Google will generate a bunch of related terms:\n\nYou’ll also see keyword search volume.\n\nPut the ones with the lower search volume into Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool. \n\nThe tool will show more data to help you determine whether they’re long-tail keywords. And whether you want to target them.\n\nHow to Use Long-Tail Keywords\n\nLearning how to identify long-tail keywords is only half the battle. \n\nOnce you have found your keywords, you need to use them correctly on your page. This guide to on-page SEO shows you what you need to know about using keywords correctly.\n\nBut as a quick primer, here are a few on-page SEO tips that apply to long-tail keywords:\n\nConsider the User’s Search Intent\n\nAdding your keyword to your page isn’t enough. For your page to rank highly in Google, your content needs to satisfy the user’s search intent.\n\nSatisfying search intent means giving users what they want.\n\nFor example, if they’re looking for “weight loss tips,” you can create a blog post listing different tips that may be useful.\n\nAny long-tail keyword you plan to target with your site could fall into one of these four categories of search intent:\n\nInformational intent: Users are looking for information (e.g., “how does your body feel after meditation?”)\nNavigational intent: Users are looking for a specific website or a webpage (e.g., “Apple ID account login”)\nCommercial intent: Users are doing research before making a purchase decision (e.g., “best SEO tool for small businesses”)\nTransactional intent: Users are looking to make a purchase (e.g., “buy sweat suits in bulk”)\n\nSemrush’s “Intent” feature makes it easy to find a keyword’s search intent. \n\nThat way, you can create content that gives your reader exactly what they’re looking for.\n\nFor example, if your long-tail keyword has informational intent, you likely need to create a blog post.\n\nOr if your keyword has transactional intent, you need to create pages that sell your products or services. Like ecommerce product pages or regular landing pages. \n\nPlace Your Keywords Strategically\n\nInclude your long-tail keyword in your page’s title and header tags if you can. Use it in your first paragraph, too—preferably in your first sentence.\n\nLong-tail keywords (like “best SEO tool for small businesses”) are sometimes long and clunky. So they’re not always easy to use naturally in a sentence. \n\nYou might have to get creative or adjust your keyword a little. \n\nJust make sure you’re not forcing your keyword onto your page. Readability and usability always come first.\n\nCreate Topic Clusters\n\nTopic clusters are a great way to organize your content for both search engines and humans.\n\nOnce you’ve optimized your pages around long-tail keywords, build topic clusters by linking from pages that target long-tail keywords to pages that target head terms (pillar pages).\n\nJust make sure they’re all topically similar.\n\nLike this:\n\nBy organizing your content in topic clusters, you can help users find the information they’re looking for quickly and easily.\n\nThis can lead to increased search engine rankings, higher engagement, and increased time on site.\n\nOptimize for Long-tail Keywords\n\nKeyword research remains the foundation of any successful SEO campaign. And long-tail keywords are ideal for new sites (or sites that don’t have a ton of authority yet).\n\nIf you’ve been struggling to rank for your target terms, it may be because those keywords were too competitive. And it might be time to switch your focus to long-tail keywords instead.\n\nOptimize Your Website for Long-Tail Keywords\n\nUsing Semrush Tools\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
