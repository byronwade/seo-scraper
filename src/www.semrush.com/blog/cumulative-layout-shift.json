  "content": "What Is Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)?\n\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS) measures the visual stability of your webpage’s content as a user views it. This metric takes into account unexpected movement of elements in the viewport as the page loads.\n\nThese kinds of layout shifts can frustrate users because they occur without warning. Making for a poor user experience. \n\nFor example, imagine you’re looking to buy new shoes, so you visit a product page for a pair you like. The page begins to load, and you know you want the pair so you go to click or tap the buy button. \n\nBut then an ad loads at the top of the screen, and the buy button shifts down. Just as you were about to click it. So you end up clicking on the ad instead.\n\nThat's an unexpected layout shift.\n\nCLS is only concerned with unexpected layout shifts above the fold. Layout shifts that happen outside of the viewport are not factored into your CLS score.\n\nCumulative Layout Shift is one of Google’s Core Web Vitals (CWVs). These are metrics Google uses to measure your website’s user experience. \n\nBesides CLS, there are two other Core Web Vitals:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP): Measures your page’s perceived load speed\nInteraction to Next Paint (INP): Assesses how responsive your page is\n\nCore Web Vitals are page experience signals that can affect your rankings. So, adhering to Google’s recommendations in line with good CWV scores can lead to better performance in search results.\n\nFor CLS specifically, that generally involves limiting the number and extent of shifts of different elements on the page.\n\nNote\n\nCLS is a measure of unexpected layout shifts. If a user clicks a menu and it expands (within 500 milliseconds), that's an expected layout shift because it directly responds to the user’s action. This shouldn’t affect your CLS score.\n\nHow to Measure Cumulative Layout Shift\n\nThere are a few ways to measure your Cumulative Layout Shift score:\n\nGoogle’s PageSpeed Insights\n\nPageSpeed Insights analyzes your website’s CLS on both mobile and desktop.\n\nTo find your score, simply input your website’s URL (or a specific page you want to test) in the tool and click the “Analyze” button.\n\nYou’ll see a report of your CLS performance and other Core Web Vitals.\n\nScroll down to the “Diagnostics” section and select the “CLS” filter to see recommendations specifically regarding Cumulative Layout Shift.\n\nNote that PageSpeed Insights can only analyze one page at a time.\n\nYou can also use Lighthouse within Chrome’s DevTools. Bear in mind that this data may provide slightly different results. But you can access it without leaving the page you’re looking to analyze.\n\nPro tip\n\nYou may want to test this in an incognito window, to avoid site history and extensions affecting your performance.\n\nJust right click anywhere on the page and select “Inspect” (or use Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows, or Cmd+Option+I on Mac). \n\nIn the window that appears, click the “Lighthouse” tab. Change any relevant settings and click “Analyze page load.”\n\nYou’ll then see a similar set of results as you would in PageSpeed Insights. \n\nAs with the PageSpeed Insights tool, you can only use Lighthouse to analyze one page at a time.\n\nSemrush’s Site Audit Tool\n\nSemrush’s Site Audit tool lets you check your Cumulative Layout Shift score for multiple website pages at once.\n\nSimply enter your domain name, and click the “Start Audit” button.\n\nThen, configure the tool’s settings according to your preferences. And click on “Start Site Audit” to generate your report.\n\nIn the “Thematic Reports” widget, click “View details” under “Core Web Vitals.”\n\nScroll down to see an overview of your Cumulative Layout Shift scores.\n\nNote\n\nSite Audit shows Total Blocking Time (TBT) instead of Interaction to Next Paint (INP). Google’s Chrome team has said that TBT correlates well with INP as a lab metric.\n\nClick on an issue under the “Top Improvements” area to get more information and recommendations. The tool also shows the number of pages each issue affects.\n\nScroll down to the “Analyzed Pages” table to see which pages Site Audit analyzed for your Core Web Vitals. Click “Edit list” and add up to 10 pages you want to analyze. \n\nThe changes will come into effect when you run the audit again.\n\nCheck Your Cumulative Layout Shift Score\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nWhat Is a Good CLS Score?\n\nA good CLS score is 0.1 or lower. This means your layout remains stable as it loads. So, visitors can easily read, click, and interact with your content without unexpected shifts disrupting their experience.\n\nHere’s the performance scale:\n\nYour Cumulative Layout Shift score is a measure of the largest burst of layout shift scores for unexpected layout shifts as your page loads. And layout shift shift scores are made up of two components:\n\nImpact fraction\nDistance fraction\n\nWhere:\n\nLayout shift score = impact fraction x distance fraction\n\nThis means that the larger the elements that shift and the further they shift, the higher your CLS score will be. Likewise, lots of layout shifts of any magnitude that occur in quick succession will lead to higher CLS scores.\n\nCommon Issues That Cause a Poor CLS Score\nImages Without Dimensions\n\nWhen you add images to your webpage without specifying their width and height, the browser doesn't know how much space to allocate until they finish loading. This can cause other elements on the page to shift unexpectedly.\n\nImagine you click on a link to a blog post. The title and text load in, and just as you start reading, all the text shifts down because a large image loads below the title but above the body text. This is an unexpected layout shift due to the creator not specifying image dimensions.\n\nAds, Embeds, and iFrames Without Dimensions\n\nAds, embeds, and iframes without set dimensions can also cause layout shifts. These elements can push content around as they load, leading to a poor user experience.\n\nThis is common with third-party ads in particular. As you may have limited control over the sizes of ads your network inserts into your content.\n\nDynamically Injected Content\n\nWhen you dynamically add content (like a banner of related posts or a form widget) to a page without first relying on user interaction, you can cause unexpected layout shifts.\n\nDynamically added content can include:\n\nImages or videos that load in response to user actions\nBanners that appear after a certain amount of time on the page\nAds that appear as you scroll\nSocial media feeds that load more posts automatically\nComment sections that expand\n\nWhen dynamically injected content appears in a way that pushes other elements around on the page, it results in unexpected layout shifts. Affecting your CLS score.\n\nWeb Fonts Causing FOIT/FOUT\n\nFlash of Invisible Text (FOIT) and Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) can occur when custom web fonts load. With FOIT, the text is invisible until the main font loads. But the space taken up is based on the fallback font (which may be styled differently to the font you want to show), meaning the layout can shift.\n\nWhile FOUT shows text in a fallback font and then switches to the web font once it loads. If the two fonts are sufficiently different in style, it can affect the layout of other elements.\n\nImproperly Implemented Animations\n\nCertain CSS properties can lead to unexpected layout shifts if you don’t use them correctly. Typically, these are properties like “box-shadow” and “box-sizing,” along with “top” and “left.”\n\nSome properties can trigger a re-layout of a page. While others can lead to layout shifts even if the element that shifts is on its own layer.\n\nFind What’s Causing Layout Shifts\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nHow to Improve Your Cumulative Layout Shift Score\n\nImproving your CLS score can provide users with a better experience. And it could influence your rankings too. Here are a few ways to do this:\n\nSpecify Image Dimensions\n\nAlways set width and height attributes for your images, video embeds, and other media. This tells the browser how much space to reserve for these elements.\n\nDefining these dimensions lets the browser allocate space in the document layout before the image or video fully loads. Minimizing unexpected layout shifts. \n\nLet’s say you add a website banner for desktop users. If the banner’s image dimensions are 1200 x 400 pixels, add the code below to your website HTML code:\n\n<img src=\"banner.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Example banner image.\">\n\nNote\n\nIf you’re using a CMS like WordPress or a page builder plugin, the platform will typically specify image dimensions for you. \n\nUse CSS Aspect Ratio Boxes\n\nImplement aspect ratio boxes in your CSS to maintain the same width-to-height ratio regardless of screen size. This ensures your content scales without layout shifts. Ideal for mobile responsiveness.\n\nAspect ratio boxes work by creating a container with a predefined size ratio. This prevents the content from expanding or contracting in a way that could shift other page elements.\n\nTo create a responsive aspect ratio box for a video, you could use something like this:\n\n.video-container {\nposition: relative;\npadding-bottom: 56.25%;\nheight: 0;\n}\n.video-container iframe {\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0;\nleft: 0;\nwidth: 100%;\nheight: 100%;\n}\n\nThe above code keeps your video in a designated area of your webpage and maintains its proper shape. It won't shift or cause layout changes as your page loads. \n\nA more modern approach (on modern browsers that support it) would be something like this:\n\n.video-container {\naspect-ratio: 16 / 9;\nwidth: 100%;\n}\n.video-container iframe {\nwidth: 100%;\nheight: 100%;\n}\nReserve Space for Dynamic Content\n\nAnticipate and reserve space for dynamic content like ads to prevent them from pushing content around when they load. When the dynamic content loads, it fits into the allocated space without affecting the layout of other page elements.\n\nFor example, if you plan to display an ad at the top of an article, include a placeholder the same size as the ad.\n\nAdd a div element where you want the ad to appear in your article. Give this div an ID or class you can refer to in your CSS. Like this:\n\n<div id=\"ad-placeholder\"></div>\n\nPlace this div at the top of your article where the ad will load.\n\nUse CSS properties to specify the dimensions of this placeholder. Ensure these dimensions match the ad size that will load in this space. For example, if the ad is 728 x 90 pixels, add the following CSS code:\n\n#ad-placeholder {\nwidth: 728px;\nheight: 90px;\nbackground-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n\nThe above CSS code will make the placeholder div occupy the amount of space intended for the ad before it loads. The background color is a visual cue to notify the user that something will appear there. \n\nTo make it responsive, use percentages for width and maintain the aspect ratio with padding. Typically, ads have fixed sizes depending on the device. \n\nUse media queries to adjust the placeholder's size based on the screen size. This way, your placeholder adapts to various screen sizes but remains ready for a specific ad size when viewed on larger screens.\n\n#ad-placeholder {\nwidth: 100%;\nheight: 0;\npadding-bottom: 12.5%;\nbackground-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\n#ad-placeholder {\nwidth: 728px;\nheight: 90px;\npadding-bottom: 0;\n}\n}\nAvoid Adding New Content Above Existing Content\n\nAdding content above what's currently on the screen can push everything down, disrupting the user's reading or browsing flow.\n\nInstead of dynamically inserting a promotional banner at the top of a page the user is viewing, consider adding it to a section the user hasn't scrolled to yet. Or, insert it after a user action, like clicking a button.\n\nRemember\n\nLayout shifts that happen soon after a user interacts with the page are not necessarily unexpected. CLS is associated with layout shifts a user doesn’t expect.\n\nHandle Fonts Properly to Prevent FOIT/FOUT\n\nMinimize the impact of web fonts by preloading essential fonts and using the font-display CSS feature to control how and when fonts display.\n\nPreload fonts and set font-display to \"optional\" to reduce the likelihood of text being invisible (FOIT) or abruptly changing style (FOUT). The “optional” display attribute lets the browser choose to use a fallback font if your main font takes too long to load.\n\nTo preload critical web fonts, use a line of code like this:\n\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"https://example.com/fonts/mywebfont.woff2\" as=\"font\" type=\"font/woff2\" crossorigin>\n\nUse the following in your CSS to ensure the text remains visible during font loading and prevent layout shifts:\n\n@font-face {\nfont-family: 'MyWebFont';\nsrc: url('/mywebfont.woff2') format('woff2');\nfont-display: optional;\n}\nUse the Transform CSS Property for Animations\n\nFinally, if you find animations are leading to poor CLS scores, consider using the “transform” CSS property. This lets you animate elements on the page without leading to unexpected layout shifts. \n\nAs with adding image dimensions, this is something your website builder might do for you. But if not, you can use “transform: scale()” instead of changing the height and width properties. \n\nAnd you can move elements around with “transform: translate(). Rather than changing the top, right, bottom, or left properties.\n\nImprove Your CLS Score with Semrush\n\nSemrush’s Site Audit tool identifies your website's CLS issues and provides tailored advice to improve your Cumulative Layout Shift score.
