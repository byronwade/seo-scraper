  "content": "What Are Google Local Services Ads?\n\nGoogle Local Services Ads are paid ads that help local service businesses collect leads directly through phone calls and message requests. \n\nThey only appear for relevant local businesses to the person searching. And at the very top of Google’s search results. \n\nThese ads can display the company’s name, reviews, ratings, city, phone number, opening hours, and more. \n\nLike this:\n\nSo businesses can connect with qualified leads, ready to convert. \n\nThe Difference Between Local Services Ads and PPC\n\nYou pay per lead with Local Services Ads (LSA). Unlike pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, where you pay when someone simply clicks on your ad.\n\nThere’s no direct keyword bidding on ads for Local Services. You can instead let Google set your bid. Or manually set your own maximum bid per lead. \n\nAnother important difference is where your ads appear. \n\nPPC ads show up above or below Google search results. \n\nLike so:\n\nAnd on other Google search partner websites.\n\nWhereas Local Services Ads always appear at the top of Google’s search results. \n\nLike this:\n\nPlus, with PPC, you need to do the hard work of keyword research and A/B testing to show up for the right search queries and find customers. \n\nBut with LSAs, Google automatically generates your ads and determines rankings by your review rating, response rate, and proximity to a searcher’s location. \n\nAnd you’ll only pay if a customer calls, books, or messages you directly through the ad.\n\nNote: Google LSAs shouldn’t replace PPC ads or organic listings. They simply provide a way to reach different customers at a different stage of the marketing funnel.. \n\nHow to Know if Your Business Qualifies for Local Services Ads\n\nCurrently, Local Services Ads are available for certain service categories and locations. \n\nHere are the countries where you can currently run Local Services Ads:\n\nAustria\nBelgium\nCanada\nFrance\nGermany\nIreland\nItaly\nSpain\nSwitzerland\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\n\nAnd these are many of the supported service categories:\n\nAppliance repair services\nCarpenters\nCarpet cleaning services\nCleaning services\nCountertop services\nElectricians\nFencing services\nFlooring services\nFoundations services\nGarage door services\nGeneral contractor services\nHandyman\nHome inspection services\nHVAC (heating or air conditioning)\nJunk removal services\nLandscaping services\nLawn care services\nMoving services\nPest control services\nPlumbers\nPool cleaning services\nPool contracting services\nRoofers\nSiding services\nSnow removal services\nTree services\nWater damage services\nWindow cleaning services\nWindow repair services\n\nNote: The supported services may vary by location. For example, law firms can use LSAs in the United States but not in the United Kingdom. Use Google to check your business eligibility.\n\nBut even if your business is eligible, you must pass Google’s screening and verification process before running Local Services Ads. \n\nThe process varies by industry and location. And may include background, business registration, insurance, and license checks. \n\nCheck Google’s business screening and verification requirements to view requirements by business category.\n\nThen, set up your Local Services account and wait for approval. \n\nHow Much Do Google Local Services Ads Cost? \n\nLocal Services Ads are pay-per-lead and can cost around $25 USD per lead. Costs can vary widely. Your exact LSA cost will depend on your location, industry, and competitors. \n\nFor a rough estimate, check out Google’s cost tool. \n\nThe great thing about Google Local Ads, though, is that you control your budget. \n\nYou set your budget based on the number of leads you want per week. \n\nAnd once you reach your monthly limit, your ad stops showing. Unless, of course, you increase your budget. \n\nWhat Is Google Guarantee?\n\nThe Google Guarantee is a badge that appears in Local Services Ads for home service providers. It shows potential customers that Google has vetted your business. \n\nOnly home service businesses that have passed Google’s screening and verification process can get a badge. Which can give customers peace of mind. \n\nThis is what the Google Guarantee looks like:\n\nAn additional benefit of the Google Guarantee badge is that Google may reimburse customers who are dissatisfied with the quality of your work. At no cost to you. \n\nThese are the lifetime reimbursement limits for each country:\n\nUnited States: $2,000\nCanada: CAD $2,000\nUnited Kingdom: GBP £1,500\nIreland: EUR €1,500\nSpain: EUR €1,500\nFrance: EUR €1,500\nItaly: EUR €1,500\nGermany: EUR €1,500\nAustria: EUR €1,500\nBelgium: EUR €1,500\nSwitzerland: CHF ₣2,000\n\nNote: Customers must book services through Local Search Ads to be eligible for reimbursement. And reimbursement is solely at Google’s discretion.\n\nGoogle will not reimburse customers for add-ons or future projects, damages to property, dissatisfaction with price or provider responsiveness, or cancellations.\n\nRead Google’s reimbursement guide to learn more about how the process works for customers.\n\nWhat Is Google Screened?\n\nGoogle Screened is an endorsement badge that shows that a professional service business has passed license checks. Which can help build trust with potential customers.\n\nThe free screening process verifies that professional licenses are current. Both when businesses join Local Services and on an ongoing basis. \n\nThe Google Screened badge covers professional services, including the following:\n\nLaw\nFinancial planning\nReal estate\nChild care or preschool industries\n\nHere’s what the Google Screened badge looks like:\n\nNote: The Google Screened badge is currently only available for businesses in select verticals in the United States. \n\nHow to Set Up Google Local Services Ads\n\nSetting up Google Local Services Ads is easy. \n\nHere’s the process, step by step:\n\n1. Create Your Profile and Check for Eligibility\n\nSet up your account by navigating to the Google Local Services Ads page. \n\nIf you already have a Google Ads account, click “Sign in.” If you don’t, click “Get started.” \n\nNext, fill in your location information and job (services) category. Click “Check Eligibility.”\n\nThen, create your profile by filling in all your business details. Including name, address, website, service areas, service types, business hours, and more. \n\nSome fields are optional. But the more information you give Google, the better your chances of getting approved. \n\nThe final step is a generic preview of your ad and how it’ll be displayed. \n\nYou can’t edit anything in this step. It’s just a preview of what your ad can look like in Local Services Ads. \n\n2. Prove Your Business Is Trustworthy\n\nIn the next step, you’ll get the chance to let Google know your business is trustworthy. \n\nDepending on your location and service category, you’ll be asked to provide more or less information. \n\nFor example, Google may ask for details regarding your business license or proof of insurance. \n\nIf so, fill out those sections with as much detail as possible. \n\nThen, with all the information you’ve entered, Google will automatically start looking for reviews on your Google Business Profile. \n\nNote: Your review score and the number of reviews play a big role in how Google ranks your business. \n\nIf you don’t have customer reviews yet, click on “See link options.”\n\nYou can send these links to previous or current customers to get reviews. Any review you get from these links will be shown as verified reviews. \n\nThe next step is to choose the type of bidding you want. And your weekly budget. \n\nYou can choose one of Google’s suggested budgets or set your own. \n\nThe final step is adding your billing information. \n\nIf you already have a Google Ads account, Local Services can use your existing payment information. \n\nIf you don’t, fill this section in. \n\nAnd you’re done! \n\n3. Wait for Approval\n\nGoogle’s screening and verification process can take anywhere from a couple of days to weeks. \n\nIt depends on your business type and the state, province, and country in which you operate. (Among other factors.)\n\nTo learn what’s required to complete your screening and verification, check out Google’s requirements page. \n\nThere, scroll down to select your country and business category. \n\nHow to Manage Your Local Services Ads\n\nOnce approved, you’ll see your account in the “Live Accounts” section within your dashboard. \n\nBut Google Service Ads don’t launch automatically. \n\nTo start running ads, click on your “Account name” and then hit “Edit Profile.”\n\nThen, you’ll see a switch button that says, “Your ad is paused.” Toggle it on to launch your Local Services Ads. \n\nManage Your Account\n\nAfter turning your ads on, scroll down to view and edit your account details.\n\nThe “Budget” box shows your bidding mode, weekly budget, and leads. \n\nIf you want to increase or decrease your budget, click the pencil icon at the top right. And adjust accordingly. \n\n“Job types” lists all the services you offer. If you add or remove services at any point in time, adjust them here. \n\nBelow that, you’ll see two sections that aren’t part of the approval process.\n\nThe first is “Photos.”\n\nUpload high-quality photos of your team, work, or equipment. \n\nThis can give potential customers an impression of what your business looks like. It helps build trust and reputation. \n\nFor more information, check out the Local Services Ads photo guidelines.\n\nThe second is “Message Leads,” under “Settings.” \n\nTurn this option on so leads can contact you via message and email. In addition to calls. Messages are 50% of the cost of a phone lead. \n\nNote: Messaging is currently only available in the U.S. and Canada. \n\nThen, if you scroll down a little more, you can confirm your service areas and business hours. \n\nManage Your Leads\n\nLeads are folks who have shown interest but aren’t customers yet. So, the sooner you follow up, the higher your chances of converting that lead into a customer. \n\nTo see (and manage) your leads, click on “Leads” in the left-hand column. \n\nNote: You can also manage your leads via the Local Services app on Android and iOS. \n\nThis dashboard shows your new, active, booked, and completed leads. \n\nAs well as a list of each customer, job type, location, lead type, and last activity. \n\nIf you click on a lead, you’ll see a summary. \n\nIncluding the status, lead type, business category, and a few sections for you to add additional information. \n\nYou can even listen to call recordings (U.S. and Canada only). \n\nHere are the steps you can take after reviewing your leads:\n\nReply by sending your message as an email or text message (U.S. and Canada only)\nCall the lead based on the phone number they listed\nDecline the request\n\nOnce you respond to a lead, their status becomes “Active.” \n\nYou can find all active leads in the “Active” section of the dashboard.\n\nAfter you book a job, mark that lead as “booked” to track upcoming jobs.\n\nLike so:\n\nThis feature helps you schedule upcoming appointments, send confirmation emails, and gather customer reviews. \n\nManage Your Reports\n\nTo review your budget and lead performance, head to the “Reports” section. \n\nYou’ll see an overview of your budget, how many leads you’ve been charged for, and any appointments booked. \n\nIf you scroll down, you’ll see specific information about your leads. Like phone number, name, lead type, and business category.\n\nThis specific information can help you evaluate whether the leads coming in are high-quality. Or if you’d need to tweak anything to get better results.\n\nPlus, this is data coming directly from the ad platform. Something you don’t get with regular Google Ads campaigns. \n\nYou can also use the drop-downs to change the “charge status” and “lead status.” And get more granular information. \n\nManage Your Reviews\n\nYour star rating and number of reviews impact how Google ranks your business within Local Services Ads. \n\nBusinesses with higher ratings and more reviews stand out. And tend to book more jobs. \n\nWhich means: When managing your Local Services Ads, one of the most important elements is generating reviews. And following up with them. \n\nTo start, go to the left-hand column and click “Reviews.” \n\nYou’ll see an overview of the reviews you’re getting. \n\nAnd a list of the jobs you’ve completed for your customers. \n\nClick on “Ask for review” under the “Action” column to ask customers about leaving a review on Google for you. \n\nCustomers are more likely to leave a review if the request comes directly from you. \n\nSo don’t be afraid to reach out and ask customers directly for Google reviews. \n\nAlso, reply to every review. It shows customers you value their business and feedback. \n\nBut you can’t respond to any reviews from your Local Services Ads account. \n\nYou’ll need to do that directly on your Google Business Profile. Or use a tool like Semrush’s Listing Management. \n\nYou’ll be able to see all your reviews in one place. And reply quickly to help your business gain more trust online.\n\nImprove Your Local Services Ads Performance\n\nThough Google Local Services Ads always show up at the top of Google’s search results, there is still limited space. \n\nUp to three Local Services Ads can appear on desktop. And two on mobile. \n\nMeaning you need to optimize your profile as much as possible to get higher rankings. \n\nGoogle ranks Local Services Ads by evaluating the following:\n\nYour maximum bid amount per lead \nYour proximity to the searcher’s location\nYour responsiveness to customer questions and requests\nYour review rating and number of reviews \n\nSo, play around with your budget to find that range where you feel comfortable paying for the leads that are coming in. \n\nAnd pay very close attention to your reviews. Ask for as many reviews as you can. And reply to all of them in a timely manner. \n\nManage Your Reviews\n\nwith the Listing Management Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
