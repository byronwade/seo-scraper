  "content": "What Is a Subdomain?\n\nA subdomain is an extension of your domain that helps you organize content and expand your business offerings.\n\nIt allows you to create standalone pages or functions, such as a blog or online store.\n\nUnderstanding URL Structure\n\nYour URL has several parts. The protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) comes before the subdomain. This is the file path that transfers data from a web server to your browser so it can load the website.  \n\nThe root domain comes after the subdomain. It’s made up of two parts:\n\nThe second-level domain (SLD) is the name of your website (typically your brand or business name)\nThe top-level domain (TLD) is the end of your domain. For example, “.com” or “.org”\n\nThe most common subdomain is “www” or “world wide web.” The subdirectory  points users to the main directory of a website—in other words, where your homepage and other core pages live.\n\nOther subdomains work to create distinct parts of a site.\n\nFor example, Google’s root domain is www.google.com. This is the address people type into a browser search bar to access Google search. \n\nOver time, Google has grown to include a full suite of products independent of its search engine. To keep these separate, Google uses subdomains such as docs.google.com for Google Docs and ads.google.com for Google Ads. \n\nUsing subdomains keeps Google’s search engine free from the distraction of other products. The lack of links and unrelated content lets Google focus visitors’ attention on search, which is ultimately what they’re there for.\n\nSubdomains create a separate identity, and provide an opportunity to create a unique website within a website.\n\nFor example, Google Docs and Google Ads are unique products. A subdomain lets Google use a different design and content structure to create a clear distinction between them (and other products). \n\nGoogle markets subdomains independently while keeping them under the umbrella of the primary domain that users know and trust.\n\nSubdomains vs. Subdirectories\n\nSubdomains and subdirectories are both smaller subsets of a root domain that let you organize website content. \n\nBut there are distinct differences.\n\nA subdomain acts as another website that can use a different design or interface from the main domain \nA subdirectory is a folder that sits inside a domain\n\nSay you run an online pet food store and want to add a blog to give your audience tips on feeding their pets a wholesome diet. \n\nYou can add your blog as a subdirectory by creating a new page in the same way you do for a product or service. \n\nThe blog becomes a folder within your primary domain. This means it uses the same design and content management system (CMS) as the rest of your website. \n\nWhen a user clicks through to your blog, the URL will look like this: www.mypetstore.com/blog\n\nNow, let’s say your reason for creating a blog is to focus on another area of your business. For example, pet behavior training. The content is different from what’s on your main site, so it makes sense to keep it separate. \n\nCreating a subdomain lets you create a blog on a different CMS (e.g., WordPress) with its own interface. \n\nYour blog now sits outside of your main domain and the URL looks like this: blog.mypetstore.com \n\nA subdomain always sits before the root domain in the URL. A subdirectory always sits after. \n\nAnother slight difference between the two is how they affect the nested structure of your site. \n\nWith a subdirectory, you can add subfolders to the main folder that point to different categories. For example, www.mypetstore.com/blog/pets and then www.mypetstore.com/blog/pets/dogs. \n\nBecause a subdomain acts like a root domain, you can add subdirectories to your subdomain to organize pages. \n\nFor example, ads.google.com has “home” as a subdirectory. This helps to organize succeeding pages. In this case, “how it works” follows the subdirectory and creates a clear path that flows from subdomain landing page to subdirectory to content.\n\nThis URL structure promotes easy navigation for users and search engines.\n\nShould You Use a Subdomain or Subdirectory? \n\nSubdomains are best for content that is too distinct from your main website. For example, if the topic has a different purpose or requires a specific CMS or design. \n\nThe clear separation prevents user confusion and stops you from sending mixed messages to search engines about your content.\n\nSubdirectories are best for content that is relevant to your main website. \n\nFor example, if your website is www.mypetstore.com, it makes sense to place dog food in a subdirectory (e.g., www.mypetstore.com/dog-food) as it fits with the main site. \n\nWhen to Use Subdomains\n\nSubdomains give webpages a unique identity while keeping them part of your main website. There are a few instances in which you can benefit from using them:\n\nCreating a Blog\n\nIf your target blog topics and keywords don’t relate to the rest of your website, using a subdomain lets you engage visitors with different content.\n\nFor example, Fiverr’s main website focuses on its marketplace of freelancer services. \n\nIts blog is a separate entity that features a variety of topics, such as company news and business tips. Fiverr hosts its blog on a subdomain, as seen in the screenshot below.\n\nThis allows Fiverr to organize its main site around the marketplace and grow its content marketing without distracting from its central selling point (freelancer services). \n\nAdding an Ecommerce Store\n\nA subdomain allows you to add ecommerce functionality to a website. It also lets you keep your merchandise store separate from your main offering. \n\nSay your website started as a blog, but you’ve grown your audience to the point of selling products to monetize it.\n\nWith a subdomain, you can create an online store using an ecommerce platform (e.g., adding Shopify or WooCommerce as a subdomain of a WordPress blog). \n\nHubspot, for example, is an inbound marketing platform that has expanded to offer a range of branded apparel.\n\nA subdomain allows the company to market products and process transactions without having to change the code or functionality of its main site. It can also sell apparel without distracting from its main offer (marketing software).\n\nTesting or Building a New Website\n\nSubdomains let you test a new version of an existing website or individual pages before they go live. So you can trial new features and fix bugs without affecting the functionality of the current site. \n\nThey also provide staging platforms for new websites. For example, Squarespace’s website builder hosts newly created sites on a separate subdomain.\n\nWith this, users can build a website for free before committing. After a free trial ends, they can sign up to a Squarespace plan and either buy a domain or leave the site on the subdomain. \n\nOptimizing for Mobile\n\nMany new small business websites are responsive out of the box so that content adapts to each user’s chosen device (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop, etc.). \n\nBut if you’re adding mobile functionality to an existing website built for desktop, a dedicated mobile subdomain makes it easier to create a tailored experience. Without having to overhaul your entire site.  \n\nFacebook, for example, defaults to the m.facebook.com subdomain for users visiting on a mobile browser. \n\nInstead of simply scaling down its desktop site, Facebook uses a subdomain to create a mobile-specific version. The site mimics the functionality of its app for easy scrolling, tapping, and typing.  \n\nThis removes the potential frustration of users trying to navigate a desktop site on a smaller screen, and creates a positive user experience. \n\nIt also means Facebook keeps code for the two versions of the site separate. Development teams can work on the mobile site without worrying about the effect of changes on another platform.\n\nTargeting New Customers or Business Goals\n\nA subdomain lets you create content for goals or audiences that differ from your main website. \n\nTake Lyft. Its ride.lyft.com subdomain homepage is for users who want to get a ride.\n\nBut this page isn’t relevant to visitors who want to learn more about the company’s self-driving cars. \n\nFor this audience, Lyft uses a different subdomain landing page. \n\nThis way, it keeps different parts of the business organized. Users who want to book a ride don’t land on the site to learn about autonomous cars (and vice versa). \n\nOn autonomous.lyft.com, Lyft goes into detail on its technology without distracting from the goal of securing bookings.    \n\nAdding a Help Center or Forum\n\nAn in-depth product warrants detailed resources to help users make the most of it. Where an FAQ section can’t answer all of the questions a customer might have, a subdomain creates a dedicated platform with its own navigation structure. \n\nTake Shopify’s Help Center. It gives users everything they need to get started, troubleshoot problems, and grow their business.\n\nBy keeping domains separate, Shopify can dedicate its main site to converting potential customers, while optimizing its subdomain around keywords for current ecommerce users (e.g., “How to add products to a store” or “Using Shopify widgets”).  \n\nReaching International Audiences\n\nIf your business is expanding into a new country, a subdomain extension gives you a space to create content specific to the new audience.\n\nFor example, Yahoo! News uses ca.yahoo.com to curate news for Canadian readers and au.yahoo.com for readers in Australia.\n\nThis helps Yahoo! appear more relevant and legitimate to different audiences. Content is reputable and curated from respected local sources, which gives readers more reason to trust it as a news source.  \n\nYou can create as many subdomain extensions as you need for free when you own your domain name. \n\nThis makes it a more cost-effective method of reaching different audiences than buying country-specific domains (e.g., mywebsite.ca, mywebsite.au, and mywebsite.fr).\n\nYou can also use subdomains to accommodate different languages. Wikipedia, for instance, makes it easy for users to find information in their native tongue with dedicated subdomains.\n\nFor example, fr.wikipedia.org is for French speakers and ja.wikipedia.org is for Japanese speakers.\n\nAre Subdomains Good for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?\n\nA well-optimized subdomain can be as beneficial for SEO, just like any other part of your website.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Google understands that subdomains are part of a larger domain and can see the relationship between the two. \n\nGoogle bots can find and index pages on a subdomain in the same way they do on a subdirectory. \n\nSubdomains also have several advantages in terms of what Google looks for in an authoritative website. \n\nWith a subdomain, you can: \n\nMove content away from the clutter of your main site for easy navigation\nReach a wider audience by targeting international markets or different topics\nGrow authority in niche markets by going into detail on different subjects\nTarget different keywords without distracting from the main purpose of your website\n\nPeople can easily find relevant content on a subdomain. This helps create a positive user experience and increases engagement. \n\nThe more time visitors spend on your site, the more Google sees it as reputable and valuable. \n\nThe result? \n\nPages that Google prioritizes in search rankings.    \n\nSo does this mean subdomains are a better option than subdirectories for SEO?\n\nThis is subject to debate.\n\nSubdomains vs. Subdirectories for SEO\n\nMany SEOs favor subdirectories over subdomains. \n\nThis is because subdirectories benefit from the authority of the main domain. \n\nWhen they sit on your website, new pages reap the rewards of the hard work you’ve put into earning backlinks and optimizing your existing content. \n\nThe authority from your most popular website pages filters down to the subdirectory, and allows you to achieve higher rankings and organic search performance quicker than a subdomain. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause with a subdomain, you’re starting from scratch. \n\nAlthough Google recognizes that a subdomain is a part of your primary domain, it sees it as a separate website. \n\nThis means the subdomain doesn’t benefit from the main website’s authority and vice versa. \n\nAs Google’s John Mueller explains:\n\nYou’ll need to verify subdomains separately in Search Console, make any changes to settings, and track overall performance per subdomain… We do have to learn how to crawl them separately, but for the most part, that’s just a formality for the first few days.\n\nThe video is from 2017, but the advice is still relevant today.  \n\nEssentially, you have to optimize a subdomain as though it’s a different website, which means working on a blank canvas. With no authority to leverage, seeing positive results will take longer. \n\nAnd when you do eventually achieve high rankings for your subdomain, the separation means it won’t provide a boost for your primary site like good website optimization of a subdirectory will. \n\nWhat it will do, however, is grow overall brand visibility and drive traffic to different parts of your business. \n\nFor this reason, subdomains are best used for SEO when content is different from the rest of your site, but you want to associate it with your brand (e.g., Lyft’s autonomous car subdomain). \n\nThis lets you optimize for new keywords to secure traffic from a specific audience. \n\nWhat you don’t want to do is have a subdomain targeting the same keywords as your main site. If you do, you run the risk of cannibalizing keywords and competing against yourself in search results.\n\nThis can result in your subdomain pulling visitors away from your main website, which may be better set up to convert them. \n\nHow to Create a Subdomain\n\nYou can add a new subdomain to your root domain via the dashboard of your hosting provider. \n\nHow you do this will differ slightly depending on your web hosting interface, but the process is mostly the same across platforms. \n\nWe’ll use IONOS as an example. \n\nFirst, log in to your account and access your domain settings control panel (CPanel). \n\nFor IONOS, go to “Domains & SSL” and click on your primary domain name. From the “Domain Details” page, click on “Subdomains” > “Create Subdomain.” \n\nType the name of your subdomain prefix. \n\nKeep this related to the type of subdomain you want to create. For example, “Shop” to add an ecommerce site or “Help” for a help center. \n\nIf you’re creating a subdomain to target a new language, use the correct country code top-level domain (ccTLD). You’ll find a full list of these on the World Standards website.\n\nThis helps prevent confusion for users. It also makes it easier to keep content organized for SEO analysis and auditing. \n\nWhen you’re happy with your subdomain name, click “Save.” \n\nThat’s it. Your hosting provider adds the subdomain to your domain name system (DNS) settings. \n\nIt can take up to 48 hours for your domain registrar to fully implement the subdomain. Otherwise, you’re good to go. \n\nYour new domain will appear under “Subdomains” in your domain name system (DNS) settings. \n\nOptimize Your Subdomains with Semrush\n\nFor SEO purposes, you have to treat a subdomain as another website that you optimize alongside your primary domain and subdirectories. Semrush has several tools to ease your workload.\n\nOrganic Research\n\nOrganic Research reports tell you about your root domain’s top organic competitors and what keywords they get traffic from. \n\nUse this to understand how other brands in your industry perform well in search and what opportunities there are for you to compete on specific keywords. \n\nTo start, type your competitor’s subdomain into the Organic Research search bar, choose your region. Then hit “Search.”\n\nFurther reading: Organic Research Overview\n\nPosition Tracking\n\nPosition Tracking lets you measure the impact of your subdomain content in daily search rankings. \n\nUse this to learn which pages get the most traffic for your target keywords and spot pages that need improvement. \n\nThis will make it easy to prioritize where to focus your time and energy to boost your SEO.\n\nTo analyze your subdomain keywords, type your primary domain into the Position Tracking search bar, then click “Set up tracking.”\n\nIn the configuring setup, click “as Root domain.” Select “as Subdomain” and enter your subdomain URL. \n\nChoose your location and click “Continue to Keywords.”\n\nNext, enter the keywords you want to track and click “Add keywords to campaign.”\n\nLeave the box checked to receive weekly performance updates.
