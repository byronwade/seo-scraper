  "content": "What is Ad Spend?\n\nAd spend is how much you pay to advertise your brand, products, and services. In this article, we’ll be talking about ads in the digital space. This includes any type of paid ad on social media, search engines, and display ads.\n\nAd spend is just one part of your overall marketing spend. Other marketing costs could be money spent on SEO, social media management, or marketing software subscriptions.\n\nTracking ad spend allows you to measure your key performance indicators (KPIs), such as:\n\nCPM (cost per mille/1,000 impressions) \nCPC (cost per click)\nCPA (cost per action)\nCPL (cost per lead)\nROAS (return on ad spend)\n\nAll of these metrics are crucial if you want to know the impact of your advertising dollars on the business bottom line. \n\nUltimately, you should prioritize KPIs like ROAS and CPA because of how much they’re tied to your campaign’s return on investment. Metrics like CPM and CPC could be considered secondary KPIs.\n\nIn short, measuring ad spend helps you understand how effective your ad campaigns and strategies are. \n\nAnalyze Your Competitor's Ad Spending\n\nwith AdClarity - Advertising Intelligence\n\nTry it Free →\nHow to Calculate Ad Spend\n\nYour ad spend is calculated by adding the amount you’ve spent on paid ads across every platform and channel. \n\nOnce you have that number, you can use it to calculate your other KPIs like cost per lead, cost per action, and return on ad spend.\n\nWhy it's Helpful to Keep Track Of\n\nAds give your brand visibility. They place your name at people’s fingertips, and they can significantly boost your sales and leads. \n\nAnd in the modern ad landscape, everyone is running ads. In fact, brands collectively spent more than $601 billion on digital advertising in 2023. \n\nIf you’re releasing a new product or service, trying to scale into new markets, or hoping to re-engage customers, decisions around your ads matter, and the money you use for them can influence your chances of success.\n\nTracking your ad spend allows you to be competitive too. You can clearly measure how much you put into an ad campaign and how it performed, and then compare those numbers with your competitors’. \n\nYou can detect if there are ways to make your spending more efficient and still reap great results.\n\nLikewise, monitoring your ad spend can provide you with market insights. \n\nFor example, you may notice that audiences become saturated with certain types of ads and stop interacting with them, signaling that you should invest less money in those ads.\n\nWays to Measure Ad Spend\n\nThere are a few ways to calculate your ad spend. The main ones are:\n\nAd spend per campaign/time period/channel – This metric is granular according to the campaign, time or channel that you want to track your ad spend for. It involves adding up your total spending on ads for the defining characteristic; for example, you could calculate ad spend for a ‘50% off’ campaign, for the previous month, or for all your ads on YouTube.\n\nCost per 1,000 impressions (CPM) – This metric is commonly used to measure display ad spend, where your brand only pays for the amount of times your ad is shown to users. If an advertiser pays $5 per 1,000 impressions, the CPM is $5.\n\nCost per click (CPC) - This metric tells you the average amount your campaign spent for every click on one of your ads. Measuring CPC will help you understand how effective your ads are at enticing your audience to go to your website.\n\nCost per action (CPA) - This metric goes a step further than cost per click and measures how much you pay for every particular action, such as completing a purchase, registration, or download. Beyond telling you how effective your ads are at bringing visitors to your site, it tells you how well your website and ads work together to ultimately get new customers and leads.\n\nReturn on ad spend (ROAS) – This metric focuses on revenue generated from every dollar spent on ads. It’s based on Return on Investment (ROI) and can be used for ads on specific channels, or for overall ad spend. ROAS is calculated by dividing the revenue created from ads by the ad spend.\n\nThe method you choose to measure your ad spend depends upon your business and ad goals, and how you calculate your broader spending budget.\n\nBenchmarking Competitor Ad Spend\n\nEvery marketer wants to know what their competitors’ ad spend is – it gives you an idea of what they’re spending, where, and why. With that information, you can benchmark your own spending and ensure that you’re staying up to speed (and overtaking) fellow brands. \n\nHow can you discover how deep your competitors’ pockets are when it comes to their ad spend? \n\nTip\n\nWant to see ad spending benchmarks across various industries?

Combine these insights with estimated paid search traffic costs and you’re in a great position to out-maneuver your business competition.\n\nThe Advertising Research tool on the Semrush platform can estimate the paid advertising spend from brands using Google search ads. The figure is calculated based on the keywords that their ads rank for, cost-per-click (CPC), and position data from Semrush.\n\nBelow, you can see the estimated paid search traffic cost for the food brand Heinz using the Advertising Research functionality. You’re also shown paid search trends and paid search positions for keywords. \n\nBoth AdClarity and Advertising Research can be accessed with a Semrush free trial or paid subscription.\n\nAnalyze Your Competitor's Ad Spending\n\nwith AdClarity - Advertising Intelligence\n\nTry it Free →\nAd Spend Data and Dollars\n\nAny business expense should be monitored and justified.
