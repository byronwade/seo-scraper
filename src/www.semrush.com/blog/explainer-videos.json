Unraveling the Storytelling Powerhouse\n\nExplainer videos are short, engaging clips that explain complex ideas through clear, concise visual narratives. Typically lasting between one to two minutes, these videos combine voiceovers, animation, and sometimes live-action footage to simplify products, services, or concepts for the viewer. \n\nWhy use them? \n\nCapturing and retaining your audience's attention is more challenging than ever. This is where explainer videos shine. They're a potent tool for snagging that elusive attention and swiftly breaking down a problem in a way that sticks. \n\nThe strength of explainer videos is flexibility—they can break down intricate topics, highlight key features, or walk viewers through a process, all while keeping them entertained and informed.\n\nThey grab and hold viewers' attention, nudge them toward making a purchase, and even give your SEO a lift. \n\nPlus, animated explainer videos can be used on any platform, from your website to social media, allowing you to repurpose content as needed. \n\nThe best explainer videos don't just tell your audience about your product or service; they show it off in an engaging and unforgettable way.

It's all about checking these boxes. Consider the following explainer video marketing tips:\n\nKeep it short: The best explainer videos are short and sweet. They pack a punch in just a minute or two, keeping viewers hooked without any fluff.\nOffer a Solution: A top-notch video is all about zeroing in on a problem your audience has and showing them exactly how your product or service can fix it.\nInclude a Call to Action (CTA): It's not just about showing off; an effective explainer video tells viewers exactly what to do next. Whether it's \"Sign up now,\" \"Learn more,\" or \"Buy today,\" it gives a clear nudge in the right direction.\nGive the Full Picture: The best videos cover all the bases—they explain what your product is, how it works its magic, and why it's the best. \nTop-Notch Quality: Last but not least, production quality matters. From crisp visuals and clear sound to a distinct voiceover, everything needs to be spot-on. A high quality video shows you mean business and builds trust with your audience.\nPopular Types of Explainer Videos (with Examples)\n\nExplainer videos come in various flavors. We've highlighted some of the most popular types that are proven to be effective in entertaining audiences and simplifying complex concepts.\n\nThe costs of explainer videos can vary significantly based on factors such as the production company, quality, length, and complexity. Generally, animated explainer videos are less expensive than live-action ones, but both options can cost thousands of dollars when using a production company. \n\nThe more affordable route is going DIY with an online animation creator or AI video tool.\n\nNote: The prices referenced in this article are approximate and based on a study conducted by Yans Media. Prices should be used as a reference point for actual pricing models. \n\nAnimated Explainer Videos \n\nAnimation videos in 2D and 3D formats use graphics and characters to tell a story. These types of videos may use illustrations like infographics, characters, chalkboards, or product demonstrations to display their goods or services.\n\nBy combining these elements, animated explainer videos can effectively communicate your message and highlight what makes your brand unique.\n\nLive-Action Explainer Videos \n\nUnlike animated explainer videos, live-action explainer videos feature real people and settings for a more personal touch. The human element is the plus with this type of video, which can create a stronger emotional connection with the audience.\n\nHowever, considering live-action videos are similar in production to traditional TV commercials, they’re usually a much more expensive option. \n\nPros\n\nStronger emotional connection with the use of real people\nMore realistic and authentic\nUsually can be produced quickly\n\nCons\n\nHigher production costs\nLimited by real-world scenarios\n\nPricing\n\nThe cost of a live-action explainer video is more likely to start closer to $10,000. The exact cost will depend on the details involved, including length and complexity. \n\nWhiteboard Explainer Videos\n\nTechnically a version of an animated explainer video, whiteboard animations are known for their hand-drawn illustrations on a whiteboard. Their advantage is their simplicity and clarity, making them good for explaining complex visual ideas in an easy-to-understand manner. \n\nWhiteboard animations have historically been used for educational content, tutorials, or messages that benefit from diagrams or step-by-step explanations.\n\nHowever, with the rise of more dynamic and visually rich explainer video styles, some may consider this classic whiteboard approach to be somewhat outdated.\n\nPros\n\nSimple visual breakdown of complex ideas \nDrawing process can keep viewers engaged\nUsually, a more cost-effective method compared to other options\n\nCons\n\nLimited color variations and creativity\nSeen as overused and becoming outdated\nLimited emotional range\n\nPricing\n\nWhiteboard videos from a production company can cost between $3,000 and $5,000.\n\nMotion Graphics Explainer Videos\n\nMotion graphic explainer videos use dynamic graphics and text for a modern look. The advantage is their sleek and professional appearance, which is good for conveying data and statistics. \n\nPlus, their ability to blend visual elements seamlessly makes them great for storytelling and enhancing your brand's visual identity.\n\nPros\n\nVisually engaging and entertaining to watch\nCan often communicate excitement and creative inspiration\nUsually quick to produce and easier to edit\nAble to customize to your brand \n\nCons\n\nLimited demonstration of product\nMay require specialized skills for complex animations\nTends to use abstract or generalized visuals, which is not great for unique products\n\nPricing\n\nTypically, motion graphic explainer videos cost around $3,000 to $5,000 for a 60-second video, depending on whether they include characters, voiceovers, or 3D elements. \n\nScreencast Explainer Videos\n\nScreencasts are recordings of computer screens, often accompanied by voiceover narration. They're often used to demonstrate software, applications, or online services.\n\nThe advantage of screencast videos is their instructional nature, which makes them ideal for tutorials, product demos, and educational content.\n\nPros\n\nCost-effective option\nPotential for DIY production\nClear demonstration of tutorials\n\nCons\n\nNot as visually appealing\nNot as creatively adjustable\nLess engaging than other options \n\nPricing\n\nPricing for screencast explainer videos ranges from a few hundred dollars to about $2,000 per minute, depending on the individual variables of the video.\n\nUltimately, choosing the right type of video depends on your brand, target audience, and the complexity of the topic you're addressing.\n\nExplainer Video Production: Maximizing Impact While Minimizing Costs\n\nHistorically, explainer videos have cost upwards of $9,000 for a 60-second clip. Fortunately, creating an animated explainer video doesn't have to be a daunting or expensive endeavor. \n\nWith the right approach and tools, you can produce a high-quality marketing video that resonates with your audience without breaking the bank. \n\nDefine Your Goal and Audience: What's the purpose of your video? Who are you talking to? Nail these down first.\nOutline Your Budget: Establish your budget for the video project. Consider costs such as production, software, voiceover talent, and any additional resources needed.\nDetermine Your Production Approach: Decide whether to hire a production company, produce the video yourself, or use an app. Select a method that aligns with your skills and budget.\nWrite a Catchy Script: Drafting a script upfront helps keep your message focused. Begin with your own ideas, then refine them with AI tools if needed. Aim for a concise and conversational tone. \nPick Your Style: For example, animated, live-action, or whiteboard? Choose what fits your brand and message.\nDesign Your Visuals: Ensure your visuals are eye-catching and reflect your brand's style. You can outsource or use a tool for this aspect but have a clear vision in mind.\nGet a Great Voiceover: The right voice can make all the difference. Pick one that fits your brand and speaks to your audience.\nAdd Music and Sounds: Background tunes and sound effects can really bring your video to life. Choose wisely!\nEdit and Polish: Put it all together. Make sure it flows nicely and keeps viewers engaged.\nShare It with the World: Post your video on your website, social media, or wherever your audience hangs out.
