  "content": "This week Semrush updated our Authority Score. We wanted to challenge ourselves and build a metric that would be the most resistant to spam and manipulation.\n\nWe know that all domain authority metrics are inexact. Nevertheless, we tried hard to conduct a thorough study and compare our new score to similar scores on the market (Moz Domain Authority and Ahrefs Domain Rating*).\n\nTo see what we learned from this study, read on! To read more about the update, check out this post.\n\nCheck Any Website's Authority Score\n\nwith Semrush Backlink Analytics\n\nTry for Free →\nHow We Tested It\n\nFirst, we took 24,000 random domains in 10 equal groups based on their Semrush Authority Score (2,400 domains with a score 0-10, 2,400 domains with a score 11-20, etc.).\n\nThen we checked each domain’s score on each platform (Domain Authority from Moz and Domain Rating from Ahrefs) as well as our old and new Authority Score.\n\nFinally, we looked at how these scores correlated with organic traffic and signs of link spam. \n\nThese were the spam signals that we checked for:\n\nNo organic rankings on SERPs (aka 0 organic traffic)\nUnnaturally high % of dofollow domains in backlink profile\nAn imbalance between links and organic traffic\nToo many referring domains with the same IP address\nToo many referring domains with the same IP network\nPresence of another domain with an identical backlink profile\n\nWhile comparing our old and new scores, we found some interesting patterns:\n\nThis graph shows two things:\n\nArea 1 (Red): Our old formula would normalize many scores at 40\n\nArea 2 (Blue): Our old formula would overvalue a domain’s Authority Score where we now see signs of spam and decrease the score.\n\nWith our old score that didn’t check for spam, a site that built links via schemes or manipulation could see its score in the 20-40 range. \n\nNow, we appropriately adjust these scores so you get an accurate read on every domain’s real authority.\n\nComparing our new score to our competitors' scores, we found a few interesting anomalies.\n\nIn most cases, all scores are very similar. However, we also see many points where the scores differ significantly (zones A and B). \n\nLet’s dive deeper into each zone to see what they mean.\n\nZone A: Overvaluing Spammy Domains \n\nSince there are two comparison graphs above, there are two “zone A’s;” one for Moz and one for Ahrefs.\n\nTo define these zones, we found the domains that had both of these qualities at the same time:\n\nSemrush AS less than 10 AND\nMoz DA or Ahrefs DR between 15-40 \n\nIn these zones, we saw hundreds of domains where the Semrush Authority Score was significantly lower than the scores from our competitors. \n\nWhy could that be? We believe the answer is spam.\n\nWhen we notice a site with an unnatural link profile that looks duplicated or heavily involved in a link scheme, our new formula counts it against the site’s score. \n\nTaking a deeper look, we found spam signals on over 3/4ths of these domains that Moz and Ahrefs were overvaluing in zone A. \n\nThat confirms our hypothesis that Semrush more often gives lower scores to sites with signs of spam. \n\nSpecific Examples of Spam Factors Impacting Domain Scores\n\nWant a closer look?\n\nHere’s a selection of domains we saw in Zone A with heavy spam signals, and their scores on each platform:\n\nDomain\n\n\t\n\nSpam signals\n\n\t\n\nAhrefs Domain Rating\n\n\t\n\nMoz Domain Authority\n\n\t\n\nSemrush Authority Score\n\n\n\n\nbristol-news.co.uk\n\n\t\nFollow link share too high\nBacklink profile looks manipulated\nLots of backlinks share IP addresses\n\t\n\n33\n\n\t\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\n\n\ncoursehero1.cf\n\n\t\nFollow link share too high\n\t\n\n20\n\n\t\n\n17\n\n\t\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nfreshdesignweb.com\n\n\t\nFollow link share too high\nLots of backlinks share IP address\n\t\n\n75\n\n\t\n\n50\n\n\t\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nxvideos5.rodeo\n\n\t\nFollow link share too high\nLots of backlinks share IP address\n\t\n\n29\n\n\t\n\n27\n\n\t\n\n3\n\nWhile this is just a small sample, in the chart below you can see the whole picture. \n\nOverall Correlations with Spam Factors\n\nFor every spam signal, you can see that Semrush has the strongest negative correlation.\n\nA strong negative correlation suggests that Semrush likely considers spam factors the most in our calculation. \n\nThis lets us conclude that it’s harder to manipulate Semrush Authority Score with private blog networks and link schemes.\n\nOn Semrush, it’s now easy to see any site’s spam signals right in the interface when you look at Authority Score in Backlink Analytics. \n\nFor example:\n\nWant to see the list of all the parameters of the new Authority Score?

To us, that means having tens of thousands of monthly visitors from organic search.\n\nA small site might have a leading authority in its niche even with 5-10k in organic traffic, but many larger markets will have plenty of sites with traffic in that range. \n\nIf a website has thousands of backlinks, but less than ten thousand in organic traffic, it could be a sign of the content not being engaging enough.\n\nWhen we looked at the sites with scores between 60-80 on Semrush, none had less than 10k estimated monthly organic traffic.\n\nHowever, 3.8% of sites rated between 60-80 by Moz and 8.12% of sites rated in this range by Ahrefs had monthly organic traffic under 10k.\n\nSpecific Examples of Overvaluing Sites with Low Traffic\n\nNow, let’s look closer at a few more examples from Zone B where you can see Ahrefs and Moz’s overvaluing sites with little to no estimated organic traffic:\n\nDomain\n\n\t\n\nOrganic Traffic\n\n\t\n\nAhrefs\n\n\t\n\nMoz\n\n\t\n\nSemrush\n\n\n\n\npoker88gg.us\n\n\t\n\n74\n\n\t\n\n62\n\n\t\n\n25\n\n\t\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nenjoyfestivals.com\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n17\n\n\t\n\n71\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nchinesebrideonline.com\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n75\n\n\t\n\n32\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nidropnews.com\n\n\t\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n70\n\n\t\n\n77\n\n\t\n\n5\n\nWith the new Authority Score widget in the UI, you can tell exactly how much links, traffic, and spam signals contribute to a domain’s overall AS.\n\nOverall Correlation with Organic Traffic\n\nAlthough 24,000 domains are only a fraction of the web, we saw the following trend across the sample:\n\nThis data tells us that Semrush gives higher scores to domains that are prominent on the SERPs. \n\nAlong with the negative correlations to major spam factors, we believe these findings show that Semrush Authority Score leads the way in resisting manipulation.\n\nChecking SEO Authority with Better Data\n\nYes, correlations are not exhaustive evidence. We don’t have a “true source” to compare our new score to. Each provider is subjective.\n\nBut, by combining different data relevant to a site’s true SEO weight, we can say our new AS is more resistant to manipulation than the others in many cases. Thus, we believe our score is more accurate.\n\n*Note: Majestic was not included in the comparison study because they use a different approach to calculating a domain’s authority, providing two metrics to gauge link authority (trust flow and citation flow), instead of one.\n\nCheck Any Website’s Authority Score\n\nwith Semrush Backlink Analytics\n\nTry for Free →",
