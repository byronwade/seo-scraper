  "content": "Picture this: \n\nYou’re scrolling through your Facebook feed. A well-crafted post catches your eye.\n\nThe headline is enticing, the description pulls you in, and the image is the cherry on top.\n\nYou like, share, or click on it, right?\n\nThis is the power of Open Graph in action—and this article will teach you how to use it for yourself.\n\nUnderstanding Open Graph Tags\n\nOpen Graph is a protocol by Facebook that enables your webpages to become a rich object in a social graph. In simpler terms, Open Graph controls how your website’s content appears when shared on social media.\n\nHow does Open Graph do this?\n\nThe secret lies in the Open Graph tags you embed in your webpages. These tags dictate what title, description, and image social media platforms should use when your content is shared. \n\nOf course, there are more than just three tags. And nuances to implementing them.\n\nBefore diving into that, let’s explore why Open Graph tags matter.\n\nWhy Open Graph Matters for Maximizing Social Media Engagement\n\nOpen Graph is paramount for maximizing your reach on social media platforms. Here are four key reasons why:\n\n1. Polished Look \n\nFirst, Open Graph transforms URLs into rich, eye-catching “cards” when shared on social platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and more.\n\nThese visual previews, which include a title, description, and image, are far more engaging than plain old links. It’s like going from black and white TV to high-definition color.\n\n2. Full Control Over Your Content \n\nWith Open Graph, you’re in the driver’s seat. Instead of letting social platforms decide how to present your content, you can control the narrative. \n\nYou can define the title, description, image, and even the type of content you are sharing. In the world of online marketing, control is critical, and Open Graph gives it to you on a silver platter. \n\n3. Higher Click-Through Rates \n\nEnriched previews significantly increase click-through rates (CTRs). For instance, posts with images on Facebook get 2.3 times more engagement than those without images.\n\nSo not only can more people see your content, but they’ll also be more likely to click on it. A win-win.\n\n4. Improved Brand Consistency\n\nOpen Graph tags also promote brand consistency by providing a standard look and feel across all social media platforms.\n\nThe tags ensure the same title, description, and image are displayed every time your link is shared. This reinforces your brand image and makes it easily identifiable for users.\n\nIn a nutshell, Open Graph is like that secret ingredient that takes your social media recipe from good to great.\n\nOpen Graph Tags to Know\n\nRemember we promised there are more Open Graph tags than those for title, description, and image?\n\nHere are the most commonly used ones—along with an indication of whether they are required or optional:\n\nog:title (Required) \n\nSpecifies the title of your content. Think of it as the headline that needs to grab the user’s attention.\n\nCode\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Insert Your Title Here\">\nBest Practices\nBe accurate: Ensure that the “og:title” accurately represents the content of the page. Otherwise, you might end up clickbaiting users.\nBe concise: Keep the title under 60 characters \nBe engaging: Make it capture users’ attention and encourage them to click. If you feel writer’s block, try Semrush’s AI-powered Title Generator for catchy social media headlines.\nAvoid all caps: All capital letters in the “og:title” can be considered overly aggressive. Avoid them.\nIntegrate branding: If appropriate, incorporate your brand name or logo into the “og:title” to enhance brand recognition\nExample\n\nSay we’re looking at a blog post on Semrush about reverse image search.\n\nWhen shared on social media, it looks great:\n\nThe og:title in this case is:\n\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"How to Do a Reverse Image Search (Desktop and Mobile)\">\nog:type (Required)\n\nIdentifies the type of your content. The main accepted values are: \n\nwebsite\narticle\nbook\nvideo.movie\nmusic.song\nCode\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"Insert the type here\" />\n\nSubstitute “website” through any of the values above.\n\nBest Practices\nChoose the correct type: Select the most relevant “og:type” that accurately represents the content (see list above)\nHandle mixed content: If a page contains various types of content—e.g., an article with embedded videos—choose the dominant type for the “og:type” tag\nExample\n\nFor our blog on reverse image search:\n\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\">\nog:image (Required)\n\nDefines the image that will appear on the social media platform. The right image can significantly increase user engagement.\n\nCode\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"Insert image URL here\">\nBest Practices\nChoose the right size: The recommended image size for Open Graph meta tags is 1200 x 630 pixels. These dimensions fit within the display parameters of most social media platforms, ensuring your image displays without being cropped. If you download and inspect the sample tag below, you’ll see it is 1200 x 630.\nChoose the right file format: JPEG and PNG are the safest bets. These two formats are widely accepted and retain image quality well. \nMake it high-resolution: Choose high-quality images that will look good on any device. We recommend JPEG for images with lots of colors and PNG for those that require transparency.\nEstablish relevance: The image should be relevant to the content of your page. Our example for the post on reverse image search shows a hand pulling an image backwards out of a search engine’s search box. Talk about an image saying more than words.\nExample\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://static.semrush.com/blog/uploads/media/c7/32/c732d73e66dd2ff1a093343cc4119db3/reverse-image-search-sm.png\">\nog:url (Required)\n\nThe canonical URL of your content. It tells social media platforms where to find the original content.\n\nCode\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"Insert your canonical URL here\">\nBest Practices\nProvide the canonical URL of your piece of content; i.e., the main version if there are duplicates. For example the canonical URL of “https://example.com/blog?page=1” would likely be “https://example.com/blog”\nProvide the exact URL (e.g. with or without trailing slash, with or without “www” etc.\nExample\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/reverse-image-search/\">\nog:description (Optional) \n\nProvides a summary of your content. The description should let your potential readers know what benefits they’ll reap from spending their attention on it.\n\nCode\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Insert your description here\">\nBest Practices\n\nSimilar to og:title:\n\nBe accurate: Ensure that the “og:description” accurately represents the page’s content\nBe concise: Limit your description to below 200 characters so it doesn’t get truncated and is quick to read\nBe enticing: Make the description capture users’ attention and encourage them to click \nAvoid all caps: You don’t want to seem like you’re yelling in the “og:description.” \nExample\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"A reverse image search is when you search the internet with an image. Here‘s how to do one, step by step.\">\nog:site_name (Optional)\n\nThe name of your website or brand.\n\nCode\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Insert your brand name here\">\nBest Practices\nBe recognizable: Choose a name that users will quickly recognize you by. Could be your website or brand name, but also an inflection of it (see example).\nExample\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Semrush Blog\">\nog:locale (Optional)\n\nSpecifies the language used on your website. It helps in categorizing your content accurately for users from different regions.\n\nCode\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"Insert language and country in correct format\">\nBest Practices\nChoose the right order: Provide the language first and then the country\nChoose the right format: Provide language and country in the form “language_COUNTRY”. Use official language and country codes for both (see example below).\nProvide various locales (or none at all): If you want to target more than one country or language, provide the core locale first. Then use “og:locale:alternate” to specify secondary ones. If you want to target the English-speaking U.S. only, you don’t need to specify any og:locale.\nExample\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\">\n<meta property=\"og:locale:alternate\" content=\"en_GB />\nSetting Up Open Graph Meta Tags\n\nHere’s a step-by-step guide on how to set up Open Graph meta tags for our Semrush post onreverse image search. We’ll also cover different content management systems and the manual approach.\n\nHow to Set Open Graph Meta Tags in WordPress\nStep 1: Install Yoast SEO\n\nOpen your WordPress backend and click “Plugins” > “Add New.”\n\nIn the search box, type “Yoast SEO.”\n\nChoose “Install Now,” and wait for the installation to finish.\n\nOn the following screen, hit “Activate.”\n\nNote\n\nThere are various other plugins that add Open Graph meta tags to your WordPress site. We recommend choosing a plugin that you’ve already installed to minimize the impact on your page speed.\n\nStep 2: Configure the Plugin\n\nHead to the newly created “Yoast SEO” section in the left-hand sidebar and click “Settings.”\n\nYou’ll find yourself in the site features section of Yoast SEO. Scroll down to the heading called “Social Sharing” and make sure the toggle under the card “Open Graph data” is enabled.\n\nStep 3: Check the Tags\n\nLet’s assume we executed steps one and two. (We haven’t. This is just to illustrate the result.)\n\nNow, we’d inspect the HTML of our Semrush post on reverse image search. \n\nYoast would have added all the following Open Graph meta tags automatically.\n\nYoast automatically pulls the information inside the content attributes from various places in WordPress:\n\nValue of Content Attribute\n\n\t\n\nCopied From\n\n\n\n\nog:title\n\n\t\n\n“SEO title” defined in the Yoast SEO box inside the post editor\n\n\n\n\nog:description\n\n\t\n\n“Meta description” defined in the Yoast SEO box inside the post editor\n\n\n\n\nog:image\n\n\t\n\nFeatured image of the post\n\n\n\n\nog:url\n\n\t\n\nURL of the post\n\n\n\n\nog:type\n\n\t\n\n“Article type” defined under “Yoast SEO” > “Settings” > “Posts”\n\n\n\n\nog:site_name\n\n\t\n\n“Website name” defined under “Yoast SEO” > “Settings” > “Site basics”\n\n\n\n\nog:locale\n\n\t\n\n“Site language” defined under “Settings” > “General” \n\nStep 4 (Optional): Customize the Tags\n\nOpen Graph is all about making your content more appealing—specifically for social media. \n\nSometimes that may mean using a title, image, or description different from the one on your website.\n\nTo do so, head to “Post” > “All Posts.”\n\nType “Reverse Image Search” in the search box and hit “Search Posts.”\n\nClick “Edit” underneath the post to pull up the post editor.\n\nInside the editor, scroll all the way down to the “Yoast SEO” box and click on the “Social” tab at the top.\n\nNow you can change the og:image tag by changing the “Facebook image” via “Select image.”\n\nYou can do the same for og:description via the text box under “Facebook description.”\n\nOnce you hit the “Update” button at the top of the editor, the customized Open Graph meta tags are saved and should show up in the HTML of the blog post.\n\nHow to Set Up Open Graph Meta Tags in Wix\n\nFrom the get-go, Wix automatically adds Open Graph meta tags to your pages.\n\nIt pulls the values for the tags from various places that change by page type. \n\nFor instance:\n\nThe og:image value on blog posts equals your post cover image \nThe og:image value on product pages equals your product image \n\nYou can change those values though if you like.\n\nStep 1: Access Wix’s SEO Settings\n\nFrom your dashboard, head to “Marketing & SEO” > “SEO” > “SEO Settings.”\n\nStep 2: Open the Social Share Settings by Page Type\n\nClick the page type you want to edit.\n\nIn the next screen, click “Basics & social share.” Then, hit “Edit.”\n\nStep 3: Change the Open Graph Variables to Custom Values\n\nYou’ll now see boxes for “og:title,” “og:description,” and “og:image.” Change them by deleting the variable chip and providing a value of your choice.\n\nHit “Save” and exit the social share settings.\n\nHow to Set Up Open Graph Meta Tags Manually\n\nWhat if your website runs on a content management system without a plugin or native settings to add Open Graph meta tags?\n\nYou can set them up manually. This involves adding their code to the <head> section of your webpage. \n\nStep 1: Access Your HTML Code\n\nOpen the HTML file or template of the webpage you want to add Open Graph meta tags to. \n\nFind the <head> section in the HTML.\n\nStep 2: Add Required Open Graph Meta Tags\n\nInsert the necessary Open Graph meta tags within the <head> section. You’ll find their code in the “Open Graph Tags to Know” above.\n\nHow to Test and Debug Open Graph Meta Tags\n\nSo, we’ve set up your Open Graph meta tags. Great!\n\nBut how can we be sure they’re showing up as intended? That’s where testing and debugging comes in.\n\nHere are the steps to ensure Open Graph meta tags are boosting your social media engagement: \n\nStep 1: Paste Your Post URL Into a Debug Tool\n\nMost social media platforms have a debugger for checking Open Graph meta tags. The most important ones are:\n\nFacebook Sharing Debugger\nTwitter Card Validator (still being called that way despite the rebranding to “X”)\nLinkedIn Post Inspector\n\nAll debuggers work according to the same logic. We’ll illustrate that logic using the Facebook debugger.\n\nSimply paste your URL into the input box and click “Debug.”\n\nNote\n\nYou must have a Facebook account to use this tool.\n\nStep 2: Check Your tags \n\nAfter debugging, the tool will show your Open Graph meta tags. Check whether the tags displayed match the ones you’ve set.\n\nStep 3: Look for Warnings\n\nThe Facebook Debugger will also list any potential issues.\n\nIf there are warnings, it means there is room for improvement in your tags. \n\nOne of the most common mistakes with Open Graph meta tags is incorrect image size. \n\nIf that’s the case with your image, Facebook debugger will say something like: “Provided og:image is not big enough. Please use an image that’s at least 200 x 200 px.”\n\nYou can also check the “Link Preview” to visually inspect how your image is displayed. \n\nTo address the error, change your image to the recommended 1200 x 630 pixels.\n\nStep 4: Scrape Again\n\nOnce you’ve made changes to your Open Graph meta tags, hit “Scrape Again” at the top of the page to check if the error has been resolved.\n\nDebugging in Bulk\n\nWhat if you’ve discovered Open Graph meta tags only now and want to check your whole website for issues with the tags?\n\nSince the Facebook Debugger can only handle one URL at a time, you’d be spending hours to gain an overview.\n\nInstead, try Semrush’s Site Audit tool for debugging Open Graph meta tags in bulk.\n\nHit “+ Create project,” insert your domain, and hit “Create project” again. \n\nWait for the audit to finish. Depending on the number of pages to crawl, this can take a bit.\n\nAfterward, click on your domain name to open up the Site Audit Overview.\n\nHead to “Crawled Pages” and make sure “Markup” is selected as the heading of column six of the table.\n\nClick “More filters,” choose “Markup” in the left-hand drop-down, and “Open Graph” in the drop-down to its right.\n\nHit “Apply filters,” and the report will show you all pages on your website with Open Graph meta tags. \n\nIf you click any cell in the “Markup” column, Semrush will also tell whether you’ve correctly implemented Open Graph meta tags via a green check mark. \n\nNow go back to the top of the report and head to “Issues.”\n\nUnder “Category,” choose “Meta tags” and check the report: Do any errors, issues, or warnings mention your Open Graph meta tags? \n\nIf so, you’ve got something to fix. If not, you’re all set up to shake up your social media audience.\n\nFind and Fix Open Graph Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nMeasuring the Impact of Open Graph on Social Media\n\nWe’ve done a lot of work with Open Graph meta tags by now.\n\nHow can we find out if they were worth our while?\n\nBy looking at key performance indicators (KPIs) of our social media posts, optimized via Open Graph meta tags.\n\nOne tool that provides this data is—again—the Facebook Sharing Debugger. \n\nHaving provided it with one of our URLs, it tells us how many likes, shares, and comments the post has generated on Facebook.\n\nAs with debugging, that’s a valuable piece of information—but inefficiently obtained if you want to gain an overview of the performance of all your Facebook posts.\n\nSocial Analytics from Semrush Social can help.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nFirst, launch the tool and hit “+ Add profile” > “Connect Facebook.”\n\nFollow the instructions in the pop-up to grant Semrush access to your Facebook page.
