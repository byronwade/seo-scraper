  "content": "What Is SEO Competitor Analysis?\n\nAn SEO competitor analysis (also called an SEO competitive analysis) is the process of researching your competitors to gather insights about their keyword, content, and backlink strategy and using those insights to improve your own SEO. \n\nIn this article we’ll cover:\n\nWhy an SEO competitor analysis is important\nHow to run an SEO competitive analysis\nHow to create an actionable competitive analysis report (+ share a free template)\nWhy Is an SEO Competitor Analysis Important? \n\nUnderstanding who your competitors are and analyzing their strategies and tactics is an integral part of any SEO strategy.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause your business doesn’t live in a vacuum. \n\nThere are tens, if not hundreds, of websites with content similar to yours. And they’re fighting for the same spots in Google. \n\nAnd an SEO competitor analysis is the best way to stay one step ahead. \n\nIt can help you identify who’s ranking highly for your target keywords so you can:\n\nDiscover their winning strategies (and replicate them)\nUncover their weaknesses (and capitalize on them)\nBenchmark your current SEO performance against them\n\nAnd more. \n\nNow, it’s time to discuss how to do it.\n\nHow to Run an SEO Competitive Analysis\n\nLet’s walk through the process of performing an SEO competitor analysis.\n\nTip\n\nSign up for a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along the steps in this guide. \n\nIdentify Your SEO Competitors\n\nSEO competitors are websites that are ranking in organic (unpaid) search results for the same keywords you’re targeting.\n\nYou can find them by searching for your target keywords on Google. One by one. And seeing who ranks in the top 10. \n\nBut a better way is to use the Organic Research tool. \n\nFirst, enter your domain, select your country, and click “Search.”\n\nNow, scroll down to the widget labeled “Main Organic Competitors.” \n\nThese are the top five websites you’re competing with in Google’s top 20 search results. \n\nTo see the list of all your SEO competitors, click “View all # competitors.”\n\nThe tool will show the “Competitors” tab. And you’ll see a table with all of your competitors. \n\nLike this:\n\nNow you know exactly who your SEO competition is. This is the perfect place to start for a competitive analysis. \n\nFind (and Close) Keyword Gaps \n\nA keyword gap is the difference between the keywords you rank for and the keywords your competitors rank for. \n\nMore specifically, the keywords your competitors are ranking for, but you aren’t. \n\nEach one of those keywords represents an opportunity for you to bring in more traffic. \n\nTo find keyword gaps, use the Keyword Gap tool.\n\nStart by entering your URL and up to four competitors’ URLs. Then, click “Compare.”\n\nIn the dashboard, scroll down and you’ll see a table with tons of keywords. \n\nNow, click the “Missing” filter to see the keywords all of your competitors rank for, but you don’t. \n\nYou now have a list of keywords you can use to create content to try to fill in those gaps. \n\nFurther reading: How to Use Competitor Keywords to Improve Your Strategy\n\nUncover Sitewide Strengths and Weaknesses \n\nEvery website has multiple weak points. Even dominant players like Amazon or eBay.\n\nIdentify your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses by considering these factors: \n\nAuthority\n\n“Authority” is an SEO concept that refers to a website’s overall quality. It predicts how well a site will rank on Google.\n\nAt Semrush, we use a metric called “Authority Score.” \n\nIt runs on a scale out of 100. And it’s based on the quality and quantity of a site’s backlinks (links from other sites that point to the site in question), organic traffic, and other factors. \n\nThe higher the score, the better the chance of ranking higher for relevant keywords. \n\nYou can find any domain’s Authority Score (AS) in the Link Building, Domain Overview, Backlink Audit, or Backlink Analytics tool. \n\nYou can also compare multiple Authority Scores with the Bulk Backlink Analysis tool. \n\nTo start, enter your URL and up to 199 competitors’ URLs. And click “Compare.”\n\nThe tool will then show a table with all the URLs you entered. \n\nYou’ll see each URL’s Authority Score in the column labeled “AS.” \n\nThis makes it easy to compare your score to your competitors’ scores.\n\nDon’t worry too much about exact numbers. But do try to improve your site’s authority over time. \n\nOne of the most effective ways to do that is to build high-quality backlinks. \n\nThese act as “votes” of confidence from other sites. And signal to Google that your site is trustworthy and valuable. \n\nWe’ll dive more into backlinks in a later section. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nLink Building Strategies: How to Build High-Quality Links\nContent \n\nContent plays a big role in an SEO competitor analysis. Because content brings in traffic. \n\nAnd if you analyze your competitors’ best-performing pages, you won’t have to guess which types of content will drive the most traffic.\n\nYou can just see what’s working for them. And replicate it in a similar or better way. \n\nFirst, go to Organic Research—an SEO competitor analysis tool.\n\nEnter any competitor’s URL and click “Search.”\n\nThen, in the dashboard, click the “Pages” tab.\n\nYou’ll see a table with your competitor’s top-performing pages—sorted by the estimated amount of traffic they bring in. \n\nLike this:\n\nNow, dig a little deeper. Click on the icon next to each URL to open each page. \n\nExamine these pages carefully. And look for patterns. \n\nFor instance:\n\nIs the content mostly long-form or short?\nDo they use lots of videos or images?\nAre they mostly product pages, blog posts, or something different?\n\nLet your answers to these questions guide your content production. To take the guesswork out. And recreate what’s already working—in a better way. \n\nTechnical SEO \n\nTechnical SEO is the process of optimizing a website for search engines and improving the user experience.\n\nAnd it can greatly impact your site’s performance in Google’s search results. \n\nWhich means:\n\nAnalyzing your website’s technical SEO health and comparing it against your competitors is a key step in your competitor analysis. \n\nTo get started, open Site Audit, enter your domain, and click “Start Audit.”\n\nAfter you adjust your Site Audit settings and run the audit, you’ll see a dashboard displaying information about your site’s health. And other reports.\n\nLike this:\n\nYou can go to the “Issues” tab to see a list of your site’s errors, warnings, and notices. \n\nThe tool also offers advice on how to fix each issue. Just click “Why and how to fix it” next to a specific issue.\n\nRunning a monthly site audit is crucial. You can find and fix technical issues before they can become bigger problems. \n\nBut you can also run audits for your top competitors. \n\nThen, compare and benchmark your scores. And uncover their weaknesses so you can capitalize on them. \n\nNew Keyword Rankings \n\nIf your competitors are targeting new keywords, it’s worth knowing about. Because you may want to target the same keywords.\n\nThe Organic Research tool can help you discover new keywords your competitors are ranking for.\n\nOpen the tool, plug in a competitor’s URL, and click “Search.”\n\nThen, navigate to the “Position Changes” tab. \n\nAnd filter the “All Position Changes” report to show only new keywords. Then, click “Apply.”\n\nLike this:\n\nThe table will only show new organic keywords your competitor is ranking for. \n\nAs well as the ranking position and the estimated change in traffic driven to their site by each new keyword. \n\nAnalyze each keyword individually. \n\nAnd identify whether you need to create new pages to target these keywords. That could include blog posts, product pages, or category pages. \n\nTo determine the type of page you need, look at the keyword’s search intent (i.e., the reason behind a user’s search) in the “Intent” column. \n\nFor example, if the intent is “I” (meaning informational), you might want to create a blog post. \n\nBut if the intent is “C” (commercial) or “T” (transactional), you might be better off creating a product page. \n\nIf you’re still not sure, search the term on Google to see what type of pages rank at the top. And replicate them. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhat Is Search Intent? A Complete Guide\nLost Keyword Rankings\n\nWhen a competitor loses keyword rankings, you could turn them into wins for your site.\n\nYou can see the keywords any competitor has lost in Organic Research.\n\nAgain, open the tool, enter any competitor’s URL, and click “Search.”\n\nThen, go to the “Position Changes” tab. \n\nFrom there, apply the following filters: \n\nTop 20 positions in the search engine results pages (SERPs)—to see only the most relevant keywords\nPosition changes: Lost—to see which terms you can capitalize on\n\nThen, you should see a table like this:\n\nThese are keywords your competitor used to rank in the top 20 for but later lost. \n\nA site can lose keyword rankings for a variety of reasons. Maybe it was affected by the latestGoogle algorithm update, for example.\n\nRegardless, these keywords represent an opportunity. \n\nIf you already have pages targeting these keywords that aren’t ranking well, optimize them. \n\nFor example, you could:\n\nSee if the page matches the keyword’s search intent\nCheck for any on-page SEO issues like too few backlinks or hard-to-read text\nUpdate the content with more recent research\n\nFurther reading:\n\nOn-Page SEO: What It Is and How to Do It\n\nOptimize Your Pages to Rank Better\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nTry for Free →\nAnalyze Sites on a Page-by-Page Basis\n\nNow, let’s take it a step further. And analyze competitor pages one at a time—particularly for pages ranking for keywords you don’t yet rank for. \n\nHere are the most important on-page SEO factors (things that have to do with your webpage content) you should look into for your SEO competitor analysis: \n\nTitle Tags \n\nA title tag is an HTML element that indicates the title of a webpage. It’s what you see in search engine results, social media posts, and browser tabs. \n\nLike this:\n\nTitle tags help signal to Google what your pages are about. And optimizing them is one of the easiest ways to improve your rankings. \n\nWhich is why you should look at your competitors’ title tags. Especially the ones that outrank you. \n\nWhen you do, ask yourself:\n\nDo they integrate keywords better than you?\nDo the target keywords appear near the beginning of the title tags? At the end?\nDo they include special, click-enticing modifiers like “easy,” “best,” and “free”?\n\nThe answers to these questions should give you an idea of how to craft your title tags—so you can boost your rankings. \n\nMeta Descriptions \n\nA meta description is a short snippet of text that summarizes a webpage’s content. And appears in the SERP.\n\nLike this:\n\nMeta descriptions aren’t a direct ranking factor. But they can affect (and improve) click-through rates. \n\nMeta descriptions are often overlooked. Particularly on large sites. So, don’t make that mistake.\n\nInstead, see how your competitors use meta descriptions. Notice what’s working and what isn’t. And adjust yours accordingly. \n\nURL Structure \n\nURL structure is the order, compartmentalization, and grouping of webpage URLs within a website. \n\nLike this:\n\nYour URL structure affects how easily users can navigate a site, find specific pages, and find specific content.\n\nIdeally, a URL structure is intuitive, clear, and organized.\n\nStudy your competitors’ URL structures on the pages that outrank your pages. And ask yourself:\n\nDo they integrate keywords in their URLs? If so, how?\nDo they use shorter URL slugs?\nDo their URLs describe the page content? \n\nIf you notice something you can improve, you can act on it so your URLs are as good as—or better than—your competitors’.\n\nContent & Keywords \n\nThis step in your SEO competitor research involves taking a deeper look at the pages that outrank you. And analyzing their content.\n\nAs you do, ask yourself:\n\nHow are they using keywords throughout the page? \nAre there relevant secondary keywords you could add to your content? \nIs the writing of high quality?\nDo they cover topics in a similar level of detail to you? \n\nAfter your analysis, use our SEO Content Template and SEO Writing Assistant to create better, more impactful content.\n\nSay you want to create a blog post centered on the term “home decor ideas.”\n\nOpen SEO Content Template, enter your keyword, and click “Create content template.”\n\nThe tool will analyze your top 10 rival pages and offer suggestions—like semantically related keywords you can add, specific referring domains you can build links from, information about readability, and more.\n\nLike this:\n\nAnd when you start writing, the SEO Writing Assistant will provide real-time feedback on readability, tone of voice, originality, and SEO.\n\nAs you can see here:\n\nIf you have existing content you want to optimize, copy and paste the text into the SEO Writing Assistant. \n\nAnd you’ll get ideas for quick wins. \n\nFurther reading: What Is Quality Content & How to Create It\n\nReview Backlinks \n\nPages with lots of backlinks tend to rank higher on Google. Especially if those links are from authoritative and relevant sites. \n\nAnd analyzing backlinks is an important part of SEO competition analysis.\n\nBecause when your competitors have better backlink profiles, you’ll have a harder time outranking them. At least until you can build a similar backlink profile.\n\nHere are three things you can do to review your and your competitors’ backlinks:\n\nCompare the Quality of Backlinks \n\nHigh-quality backlinks are links from authoritative, relevant, trustworthy, high-traffic websites. \n\nLow-quality backlinks (also called toxic backlinks), on the other hand, are from irrelevant websites, from suspicious domains, or involve questionable techniques. \n\nYou can quickly see your site’s (and any competitor’s) backlink toxicity score with the Backlink Audit tool. \n\nHere’s how:\n\nOpen the tool and follow the Backlink Audit configuration guide to set up your project. \n\nAnd click “Start Backlink Audit.”\n\nYou’ll see a quick summary of the domain’s important information. \n\nIncluding the Overall Toxicity Score (which indicates the number and severity of suspicious backlinks), total number of referring domains, total number of backlinks, and Authority Score. \n\nMake note of how your site’s metrics compare to your competitors’ metrics. To determine whether your backlink profile could be stronger.\n\nFurther reading: How to Do a Backlink Audit (5 Simple Steps)\n\nAudit Any Domain’s Backlink Profile\n\nwith the Backlink Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nStudy Both Nofollow and “Follow” Backlinks \n\nNofollow is a link attribute that tells search engines to ignore the link—or not to “follow” it.\n\nFor example, you might link to a competitor because it’s helpful to the reader. But you wouldn’t want to imply any type of endorsement. \n\n“Follow” links (there’s technically no such thing as a follow attribute), conversely, are normal links without any attributes. They can imply endorsement and pass ranking credit. \n\n“Follow” links are the type of backlinks you want—if what you’re looking for is SEO value. \n\nNote\n\n“Nofollow” links don’t pass ranking credit, but they can still be valuable. They can provide brand recognition and referral traffic. \n\nYou can see your and any competitor’s “follow” and nofollow backlinks using Backlink Analytics. \n\nEnter the domain and click “Analyze.” \n\nThen, head to the “Backlinks” tab and scroll down to the table. \n\nAnd toggle “Follow” or “Nofollow” to see the corresponding type of backlinks the domain has. \n\nConsider the volume of backlinks the domain has for each type as well as the websites providing those backlinks. \n\nThis can help you better understand your and your competitors’ backlink profiles. And give you ideas for where to pursue backlinks in the future.\n\nFurther reading: Nofollow Links vs. ‘Follow’ Links: All You Need to Know\n\nFind Your Backlink Gaps \n\nA backlink gap analysis helps you find websites linking to competitors but not you.\n\nIf someone is linking to your competitors, they might be happy to link to you, too. Especially if your content is higher quality. \n\nTo start, open the Backlink Gap tool. \n\nThen, enter your domain and up to four competitors’ domains. And click “Find prospects.”\n\nYou’ll see a table with a list of the websites linking to the domains you entered. \n\nMake sure you select the “Best” filter. This will show only the sites linking to your competitors but not you. \n\nNow, you have a list of websites you can reach out to for backlinks. \n\nFurther reading: Link Building for SEO: The Beginner’s Guide\n\nCapture Featured Snippets \n\nYou should also pay attention to the SERP features (search results that include additional information and elements than traditional results) your competitors rank for—like featured snippets. And try to win them your own site.\n\nTo see your competitor’s featured snippets, head to the Organic Research tool. \n\nFirst, enter a competitor’s URL and click “Search.” \n\nThen, go to the “Positions” tab.\n\nAnd filter the report to show keywords for which your competitors own featured snippets.\n\nLike this:\n\nThe table will now show only keywords for which your competitor has the featured snippet.\n\nIf you have pages targeting the same keywords, optimize them to try to win the featured snippet. \n\nLook at the featured snippet for “february birth flower,” for example:\n\nTo improve your chances of winning this snippet, you’d have to write a better, more objective answer.\n\nNote\n\nThere’s no guaranteed way to secure featured snippets. Even if you adjust your content to rank for featured snippets, other factors are involved.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhat Are the Different Types of Featured Snippets?\nWhat Are SERP Features? An In-Depth Guide\nSEO Competitor Analysis Report (Free Template)\n\nConducting an SEO competitor analysis is fundamental to your SEO success. Which means it shouldn’t be a one-time thing.\n\nYou need to keep up with what your competitors are doing. And try to always stay one step ahead. \n\nA quick and easy way to do this is to use one of our report templates. \n\nHead to My Reports and click “Monthly Competitor Analysis.”\n\nEnter your domain and two other competitors’ domains. Then, click “Create report.” \n\nThe tool will quickly create a competitor analysis SEO report. \n\nYou’ll first see a summary of your domain’s performance.\n\nLike this:\n\nThen, you’ll see how your site compares to your competitors. \n\nThe report is customizable.
