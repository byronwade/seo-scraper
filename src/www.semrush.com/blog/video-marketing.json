  "content": "What Is Video Marketing? \n\nVideo marketing is when you use video content to promote a brand, product, service, or cause. \n\nIt involves planning, creating, editing, and sharing videos for different mediums. From social media platforms to websites and vlogs.\n\nMarketing videos can help generate engagement, brand awareness, and leads. This is especially true if your video gets a lot of traction on social media platforms. Like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nFor example, cosmetics brand Glossier created a video to promote its foundation and concealer. It generated over 391,000 views.\n\nVideos are more dynamic and interactive than images or text. And easy for viewers to share. \n\nBut to reap the benefits, it's essential to have a well-planned video marketing strategy. That’s what we’ll cover in this guide.\n\nVideo Marketing Benefits \nSocial Media Engagement \n\nOne of the main benefits of video marketing is more engagement. \n\nA study on what makes news posts engaging found that news articles containing videos get more engagement. Include shares, likes, and comments on social media. Than those with photos only. \n\nThis is because video content is often more engaging than static images. And easier to digest than text. \n\nFor example, UNILAD shared a video on road marking. It got 155,000 million views, 4,400 comments, and 149,000 reactions.\n\nMore social media engagement can translate into increased exposure for your brand.\n\nAdditionally, user engagement is a ranking signal on Instagram. And other social channels. So, the more people interact with your content, the greater its reach across the platform.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse AI Video Marketing Automator to turn your top-performing blog posts into videos. Create engaging video content for social media in minutes. \n\nWebsite Traffic \n\nNinety-one percent of marketers say video content helps them get more website traffic, according to a Wyzowl survey. Because videos tend to be more shareable than other types of content. \n\nVideos can also help you get backlinks from other websites and blogs. \n\nUse relevant keywords in video titles, descriptions, and captions. To further increase the reach of your marketing videos. This can boost your SEO efforts. Potentially leading to more traffic. And higher rankings in search results, too.\n\nLeads and Sales\n\nEighty-seven percent of the companies surveyed by Wyzowl say video marketing helps them increase sales.\n\nVideos featuring product demos, information, and tutorials can influence purchasing decisions. While allowing consumers to discover new brands and products. \n\nIt helps leads better understand and research products or services. Which can further drive sales.\n\nMobile User Targeting\n\nVideos can help you reach your target market. And keep their attention. \n\nAccording to a Google survey, 55% of consumers say they watch videos on their phones while shopping in-store. \n\nMore than half of respondents say online videos help them decide on a brand or product. This could be a product comparison, tutorial, or review. \n\nFor example, the video below shows viewers how to use an air fryer. It’s around 13 minutes long. And covers everything a consumer would want to know before buying.\n\nTrust and Authority\n\nVideo marketing can establish trust by providing a more personal and engaging experience for viewers. Allowing them to connect with your brand or message on a deeper level. \n\nVideos allow you to showcase your expertise, share valuable insights, and demonstrate transparency. Helping to build credibility and authenticity. \n\nLike this video by HomeDepot: \n\nIt provides vital information consumers will need when tackling a home project.\n\nSeeing real people and real situations featured in your videos can also create a sense of reliability and sincerity. Fostering trust between the audience and your brand.\n\nAsk your customers for video testimonials. Share them on your site and social media pages to establish credibility.\n\nFurther reading: A Beginner’s Guide to User-Generated Content (Definition, Examples, and Tips)\n\nTypes of Marketing Videos\n\nUse a variety of marketing videos to attract, nurture, and convert customers.\n\nDemo Videos\n\nUse demonstration videos to show how a product works. Highlight unboxings, installation, configurations, and key features.\n\nDemo videos should be educational. Their role is to help viewers understand the \"how-to\" behind a product or service.\n\nFor example, this short video shows the Ring Door View camera in action. Viewers can see everyday people using the camera and app. \n\nBrand Videos\n\nCreate brand videos to showcase your company's mission, values, or products. And connect with your audience on a more personal level.\n\nThis type of content uses storytelling to evoke emotions, get people's attention, and raise brand awareness. It can take various forms. From short documentaries and interviews to animated videos.\n\nA great example is Apple's \"Think Different\" video. Which highlights the brand's mission to change the world. It encapsulates Apple's innovative spirit. While encouraging viewers to embrace their uniqueness.\n\nEvent Videos\n\nEvent videos are a great way to create buzz. And boost ticket sales. \n\nUse this type of video to promote the following events: \n\nSeminars\nCorporate fairs\nVirtual job fairs\nAwards ceremonies\nTrade shows\n\nAnother option is to create event recap videos. This helps show leads what they missed out on. And can increase future sales. \n\nFor example, this post-event video appeals to viewers who were unable to attend Content Marketing World. It summarizes the event, highlights key moments, and features snippets of interviews.\n\nExpert Interviews\n\nInterview videos can provide value to your target audience. And help you build credibility.\n\nDepending on your goals, you might interview third-party experts or internal stakeholders.\n\nLike this YouTube video from nutrition company Athletic Greens. Which features Dr. Andrew Huberman talking about gut flora. The brand sells products that support gut health. And this type of content can help lend credibility to its ingredients. \n\nEducational or How-To Videos\n\nEducational and how-to videos should address common challenges or problems. To educate potential and current customers on topics related to your products. \n\nThey’re also great for highlighting a product's key features and benefits. And why they matter to customers.\n\nA good example is this marketing video from Semrush. Which shows viewers how to create engaging content that ranks on Google's first page.\n\nThe video focuses on the content production process. And offers actionable tips on how to improve and refine your writing for higher rankings.\n\nExplainer Videos\n\nExplainer videos provide educational content. With a focus on specific products or services. They usually appeal to potential buyers in the awareness or consideration stage.\n\nFor instance, you could make a video that shows customers what your product does. And why it's relevant to them. Focus on a problem they're facing. And explain how the product can help.\n\nThe video below shows how Google Wi-Fi can boost internet speed. It uses animations to explain the technology behind the brand's Wi-Fi system. In a manner anyone can understand.\n\nThis type of content is often short. Offering simple solutions to complex problems.\n\nBy comparison, demo videos go into more detail about the product. And its features. They’re also more suitable for customers in the conversion stage.\n\nAnimated Videos\n\nCompanies can use animations for most types of videos. Especially those that tell a story. Or explain complex concepts.\n\nWith this approach, you can get your point across quickly. And potentially reach a wider audience. \n\nFor example, this animated video uses fictional characters. It depicts real-life situations where customers can pay with Amazon One. And shows how the product works in a clear, easy-to-understand manner. \n\nCase Study and Customer Testimonial Videos\n\nCase studies and customer testimonial videos serve as social proof. This helps instill trust in your brand. And turn prospects into paying customers.\n\nFor instance, we presented an SEO case study on a bakery. By using our SEO tools, the bakery grew mobile organic traffic by 460%.\n\nShowcasing statistics and testimonials from real users is compelling. And may help increase customer trust. If a customer trusts your brand, they’re more likely to take the desired action. Such as buying a product. \n\nNote\n\nCase studies are conducted in-house or through content marketing agencies or other third parties. Video testimonials are a form of user-generated content, meaning you'll have to ask satisfied customers for feedback.\n\nLive Videos\n\nLive video enables viewers to interact with your content in real time. Which can lead to higher engagement.\n\nFor example, live Q&A videos allow you to answer customers' questions. And connect with your audience on a personal level. Livestreams are also ideal for covering events. Like a product launch. And sharing quick, interesting facts on social channels.\n\n360° and Virtual Reality Videos\n\nAccording to Google research, 360-degree video ads have higher click-through rates. And get 41% more views, shares, and subscribers than regular video ads. \n\nThey enable viewers to virtually explore a location or product from every angle. \n\nFor example, real estate agencies use this format to showcase apartments or houses in an immersive way. Customers can virtually walk through each room, see the floor plans, and imagine themselves living there. \n\nSimilarly, virtual reality videos make use of headsets and other devices to create an immersive experience. Viewers can explore real or imagined locations. And interact with the environment around them.\n\nEither type of video can help you captivate and delight your audience. \n\nAugmented Reality Videos\n\nThese marketing videos blend digital elements with real-world objects or locations. \n\nFor example, customers can use the IKEA Place app to virtually customize their living spaces. If someone wants to buy a new desk or rug, they can scan their office with a smartphone. And see how it would look in their home.\n\nThis technology enables brands to create interactive experiences. And add new dimensions to storytelling. \n\nPersonalized Video Messages\n\nPersonalized videos enable you to deliver customized content to individuals or groups of customers.\n\nFor example, Nike created over 100,000 personalized animated videos for Nike+ members. Based on fitness data, location, and other factors.\n\nConsider recording personalized videos for high-profile customers who want to know more about specific products or services. \n\nOr, create custom video messages. To thank customers for their business, wish them happy holidays, or celebrate milestones.\n\nPersonalized video messages can help you drive sales. And boost customer satisfaction.\n\nPro tip\n\nLeverage customer data to personalize your video messages. Consider the recipient's age, gender, location, purchase history, and pain points. See our guide to content personalization for further insights.\n\nHow to Create an Effective Video Marketing Strategy\n\nVideo content marketing will look different from brand to brand. Depending on the company's size, budget, industry, and target audience.\n\nHowever, most campaigns share some common steps. Which you should take into account when crafting a video strategy.\n\n1. Align Goals with the Marketing Funnel\n\nA good starting point is to set video goals for your campaigns. For instance, you may want to reach more customers. Or create buzz around your brand. \n\nConsider the different stages of the marketing funnel when setting goals. And create content that aligns with those goals.\n\nA marketing funnel, or conversion funnel, has multiple stages that reflect the buyer's journey. \n\nThese stages may differ from one business to the next. But usually include the following:\n\nAwareness: Potential customers become familiar with your brand and product\nConsideration: At this stage, you'll nurture prospects. And position your product as a solution to their pain points.\nConversion: Shoppers are already interested in your products. But need an extra push to take the final step. And make a purchase.\nLoyalty: At this point, you'll want to follow up with customers who've made a purchase. And focus on building lasting relationships. The goal is to earn their loyalty and drive repeat business.\n\nCustomers at different stages of the funnel have different needs. It’s crucial to adapt your video marketing efforts to each stage of the buyer’s journey.\n\nAttract in the Awareness Stage \n\nBuyers in the awareness stage know little about your brand. Or what you sell. \n\nFor instance, a potential customer may have liked your Facebook page. But didn't look further into your products.\n\nAt this stage, you'll set a goal to drive brand awareness. By telling the story behind your products through video. The content should inspire, educate, and inform prospects. Rather than sell.\n\nA good example is this brand video from Shopify. Which revolves around entrepreneurship.\n\nAlthough it barely mentions the brand's name, it shows how Shopify gives people the freedom to run their own businesses.\n\nConvert in the Consideration Stage\n\nCustomers in the consideration stage are already interested in your brand and products.\n\nNow is the time to answer their questions. And address pain points. And show how your products would fit into their lives.\n\nFor example, share educational or how-to videos, case studies, or expert interviews.\n\nLet's say you’re an affiliate marketer who promotes video editing software for small business owners.\n\nConsider creating a series of videos on relevant topics like:\n\nWhat is video marketing?\nHow to use video content for brand promotion\nHow to create a video campaign using [a specific tool you’re promoting]\n10 Video marketing tips from industry experts\n15+ Must-have video editing tools for marketing teams\n5 Steps to a successful video marketing strategy\n\nFocus on educating viewers. While highlighting the benefits of your products or services. Refrain from being overly promotional.\n\nThe goal here is to spark interest. And move prospects further down the funnel.\n\nClose in the Conversion Stage\n\nNow is the time to give customers the push they need to make a purchase.\n\nFor instance, share demo or live videos. To show your product in action. Customer testimonial videos and case studies can boost conversion rates, too.\n\nLike this video that shows small business owners how they can benefit from a Semrush subscription: \n\nDelight Customers in the Loyalty Stage \n\nGo one step further and create videos to delight customers who've purchased your products. Think of it as a way to provide further value.\n\nDepending on what you sell, you may create onboarding videos, product videos, or advanced video guides. Webinars can be helpful, too. Especially when it comes to more technical products or services.\n\nSay you offer a software program for small businesses.\n\nCustomers have already paid for it. And know how it works. But you can create a series of videos to help them derive more value.\n\nShowcase hidden features, expert tips, or shortcuts.\n\nFurther reading: 65 Customer Retention Statistics You Need to Know\n\n 2. Define Your Target Audience \n\nNext, create a customer profile that reflects your target audience. This can help maximize your marketing efforts. By getting your videos in front of the right people. \n\nLearn more about your target customers through the following ways:\n\nSurveys\nIndustry reports\nMarket research \nWebsite analytics\nSocial media analytics \n\nUse demographic information to decide which types of marketing videos to create. And come up with topics that will resonate with them. \n\nFor example, if you have a skincare line, you might target women between 25 and 45 years old who live in the U.S. And earn at least $80,000 per year. \n\nThis demographic might benefit from product tutorial videos, comparisons, and real-user makeovers. \n\nPro tip\n\nUse our free Buyer Persona template creator to create customizable buyer personas for more effective videos. \n\n3. Plan Video Topics and Formats\n\nDetermine what story you want to tell. And how you're going to tell it. \n\nShort videos are great for sharing quick tips. Or advertising a product. These can be a good choice for Instagram or Facebook.\n\nFor example, use Instagram Stories to share behind-the-scenes shots, quick tips, or brand messages. Instagram stores can be up to 60 seconds long. And disappear after 24 hours. \n\nPro tip\n\nDon’t let your favorite Instagram Stories disappear. Save them as a highlight to keep select Stories on your profile permanently. \n\nYou might also consider creating longer educational videos. This type of content may perform better on owned media channels. Such as your website or blog. \n\nIt's also a good choice for YouTube. Where the ideal video length is seven to 15 minutes.\n\n4. Plan the Video Production Process\n\nAsk yourself these questions during the planning stage:\n\nWhere will you shoot your video? \nWill you need video equipment? Or will you use your smartphone?\nWill you hire talent? \nWho will be responsible for video editing? \n\nAt this point, it’s a good idea to assess your budget. Determine how much you can afford to spend. On video equipment, editing software, and other necessary resources. \n\nIf you’re using your smartphone, which works well for social media videos, you may not need a budget at all. \n\nThere are also video creation tools that allow you to repurpose existing content into marketing videos. Without the need for equipment, video talent, or editing. \n\nConvert Articles to Videos\n\nIf you don’t want or need a large-scale video shoot, turn your existing content into marketing videos instead. \n\nUse AI Video Marketing Automator to convert text into video content. Our tool also doubles as an AI script generator. Which can further free up your time.\n\nWhen you open the AI Video Marketing Automator app, you have three options:\n\nURL to Video: Use this feature to convert your blog posts into social videos. Or any other type of video content.\nAI Prompt: Enter a topic. Such as \"Video marketing statistics\" or \"How to take screenshots in Windows 10.” And let AI write the script.\nBlank: Enter your script. Or create a video from scratch. \n\nLet's say you want to turn a blog post about superfoods into a video. \n\nSelect the first option, \"URL to Video.\"\n\nThe tool will open a pop-up window where you can enter the blog post URL. And the desired video type and length. \n\nYou’ll get suggestions for the ideal video length. For each of the major social platforms.\n\nSelect the type of images you want to appear in the video. These can be stock photos, 3D illustrations, hand-drawn illustrations, or other visuals from Semrush's library.\n\nWhen you're done, click \"Create Video.” And let the tool do its magic.\n\nAI Video Marketing Automator will extract the main ideas from your blog post. And turn them into a video script. It will add relevant images, voice-overs, and subtitles.\n\nCustomize the video by clicking the icons \"Voice,\" \"Style,\" \"Music,\" or \"Media\" on the left side of the screen.\n\nIf everything looks good, click \"Export Video\" on the upper-right side of the screen.\n\nAll you have left to do now is click \"Download Video.” And post it on your website or other platforms.\n\nFurther reading: Top 10 Content Repurposing Tools\n\n5. Determine How You'll Measure Success\n\nLastly, decide how you’re going to measure video performance. \n\nFor example, you can track the following:\n\nViews\nClicks\nLikes\nShares\nComments\nSignups \nConversions\n\nUse these insights to see what you did well. And where you can improve.\n\nHow to Make a Video for Your Business\n\nThe video production process has three stages:\n\nPre-production: In this stage, you'll plan out your content. And set up the studio. You may also need to book talent, purchase video equipment, and tackle the legal aspects. Like obtaining permits or licenses for shooting in public spaces.\nProduction: This is when you'll shoot the video. Your team will test equipment, adjust the lighting, and address the small details. Such as makeup and props.\nPost-production: The post-production process includes video editing, voice-over recording, and other relevant steps\n\nWe’ve broken the video production process into smaller steps below. \n\nYou may be able to skip some steps. Depending on the type of video you’re creating. \n\nConduct Keyword Research\n\nKeywords can make your videos more discoverable. On social media platforms. And in search engines. \n\nLet's say you want to make an explainer video about protein powder. \n\nUse Semrush's Keyword Magic Tool to check the Volume (how many searches this term gets on average per month). And Keyword Difficulty (KD). Which tells you how challenging it will be to rank for this term. \n\nYou’ll also see related terms. Like “vegan protein powder” and “best protein powder for women.” Which get fewer searches per month but have lower keyword difficulty scores. \n\nPro tip\n\nLearn how to conduct keyword research for SEO to ensure you target realistic and high-performing keywords for your video content. \n\nOnce you've decided on a target keyword, use it in these locations: \n\nVideo title\nVideo file name\nDescription\nTranscript\nTags\n\nIf you're going to post the video on your website, include the target keyword in the page URL.\n\nPerform Keyword Research for Video Marketing\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nPrepare the Script\n\nVideo scripts have three primary components. \n\nIncluding:\n\nAction lines: Write a couple of sentences that describe the actions happening in a scene. (\"Go to your desk and unbox the laptop. Look at each component and explain its role.\")\nSluglines, or scene headings: These are brief directions that establish the setting of each scene. They usually specify the location. And time of the day. (“3RD-FLOOR OFFICE—DAY.”)\nDialogue: This section makes up the bulk of your script. It includes the on-screen text, voice-overs, and the words spoken by the characters.\n\nYour script's length depends on how long the video is going to be.\n\nFor example, Lemonlight recommends writing a 60-word script for videos under 30 seconds.\n\nIf your video is 60 seconds long, aim for 120 words or so. A two-minute video may require a 240-word script.\n\nThese numbers are not set in stone. It all depends on speaking speed. \n\nOverall, your video script should be clear, concise, and relevant to the target audience. Read it aloud several times before shooting for best results. \n\nSet Up the Studio\n\nShooting high-quality videos requires specialized equipment. But you can also use your smartphone. Or AI Video Marketing Automator. \n\nFor example, it's not necessary to use a fancy camera to shoot a 30-second how-to video for TikTok. But if you want to make a brand video or product demo, it may be useful to have access to professional equipment.\n\nDepending on the type of video, you may need the following: \n\nVideo camera\nShotgun mic or lavaliers\nTripods\nBasic lighting equipment\nMemory cards\nAudio cables\nBatteries\nExternal hard drive\n\nIf your budget allows for it, you might also consider: \n\nCamera lenses\nHeadphones\nTeleprompter\nAudio recorder\nGimbal\nCapture cards\nSound-dampening devices\nLivestreaming monitors\n\nPro tip\n\nVideo cameras and other accessories vary in price. If you're on a budget, start with the bare essentials. And get more stuff later on. Look for entry-level and mid-range products. These tend to be more affordable.\n\nGet the Talent Ready\n\nTalent may or may not be necessary, depending on your budget. And the type of video you want to make.\n\nFor example, this video from Semrush Academy features an industry expert on the topic of leadership and people management: \n\nBut not all videos require on-screen talent. \n\nSay you want to shoot an explainer video about a specific software program. This might work well with a voiceover only. \n\nAlternatively, use AI Video Marketing Automator. Or AI voice generators.\n\nIf you shoot a more complex video, such as a short documentary about your brand, you'll need to prepare the talent. In some cases, it may make sense to hire professional actors.\n\nGive talent the script ahead of time. And be clear about the message you want to convey. Share audience demographics and preferences. So talent can use the right tone of voice. And language. \n\nShoot the Video\n\nThe big day is finally here.\n\nStart by checking equipment. To make sure everything works properly. Have the props ready, adjust the lighting, and position your camera at the appropriate angle and distance.\n\nYou'll also need to manually adjust the camera settings. Such as aperture, white balance, and shutter speed. Based on the lighting conditions. \n\nThis will ensure accurate color reproduction. And allow you to capture the subject clearly.\n\nFollow these tips to get the best shots: \n\nShoot multiple takes. Mistakes can happen, and it's easier to fix them later if you have multiple shots of the same scene.\nCapture a variety of shots, including wide shots, medium shots, and close-ups\nMaintain consistency in lighting, framing, and audio\nMake sure the subject is in sharp focus. Use focus tracking if the subject is moving.\nDiffuse or bounce the light to avoid harsh shadows\nFrame your shots based on the rule of thirds to achieve a better composition. With this technique, you’ll visually break an image down into thirds, resulting in nine equal squares. After that, place your subject in the right or left third where the lines intersect.\nReview the recorded footage in real time to ensure it looks right\nHave some extra batteries, memory cards, audio cables, and other backup equipment on hand. In case of technical issues.\nCommunicate with your team at all times. Let them know if there's anything they should do differently, such as changing their tone of voice.\nEdit Your Video\n\nIf you make a video with AI Video Marketing Automator, it will be easy to edit. But you'll need specialized software to edit long or complex videos. Such as a documentary. Or company culture video.\n\nA popular video editing tool is Adobe Premiere Pro. It allows for multicam editing, 3D editing, and automatic captioning.\n\nMovavi is popular among YouTubers. And novice video editors. Due to its user-friendliness. It has features like motion tracking and noise removal.\n\nAnother option is Shotcut, a free, open-source video editor. Beginners will find it more challenging. But it works with 4K videos and covers all the bases.\n\nNote\n\nMost video editing tools involve a learning curve. Familiarize yourself with them before shooting the video. So you can use them to their full potential.\n\nChoose the Music\n\nThe music you use depends on the target audience. And the message you want to convey.\n\nFor example, ambient background sounds can create a relaxed atmosphere suitable for home tour videos, some brand videos, or educational videos. \n\nUpbeat music may work better for promotional content. It creates a sense of energy and excitement.\n\nLike this short video on our YouTube channel:\n\nIf you’re making social media videos, many platforms let you add music and sound effects for free. \n\nDepending on your budget and video type, you may want to use commercial songs. Or ask your creative team to produce the music.\n\nIf you use commercial songs, you may have to pay licensing fees. \n\nRegister on websites like the following to find the right music based on your needs and budget. \n\nEpidemic Sound\nYouTube Audio Library\nStoryblocks\nJamendo\nRecord the Voice-Over\n\nRecord the voice-over before, during, or after shooting the video. It's largely a matter of personal preference, as each approach has pros and cons.\n\nFor example, if you record the voice-over while filming, you may sound more natural. And save time on editing.\n\nThe problem is that any retakes on set may require additional voice-over recording. Additionally, syncing the voice-over with the visuals can be challenging.\n\nFollow these best practices:\n\nConduct a test recording beforehand. To figure out what works for you.\nPay attention to sound clarity and volume \nUse a friendly tone \nGet the pacing right\nSpeak clearly\nPlace the microphone about eight to 12 inches from your mouth\n\nPro tip\n\nDon’t forget the subtitles. Fifty percent of Americans watch content with subtitles most of the time.\n\nChoose the Right Video Hosting Platforms\n\nNow it’s time to choose a video host. \n\nOnline video platforms typically support the following files: \n\nMP4\nAVI\nMOV\nFLV\nWMV\n\nSome may also accept less common formats, such as ProRes or WebM. Check their requirements in advance. So you can choose the right format.\n\nHosting your videos on a third-party platform can make it easier to share them online. And reach your audience.\n\nBefore choosing a platform, consider your budget, type of videos, and target audience. You'll also want to look into features. And ease of use.\n\nFor example, some platforms are private. This makes them suitable for hosting videos you'll only share with your email subscribers, employees, or specific customers.\n\nHere are some video hosting options: \n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube is the second most popular website in the world after Google. \n\nWhat sets YouTube apart from other video hosting platforms is its reach. Plus, it's free to use. And allows creators to monetize videos. \n\nKey features\n\nAccess to a large audience\nFree unlimited cloud storage\nShare videos privately or publicly\nAdd subtitles and closed captions\nAdvanced analytics tools\nLivestreaming via YouTube Live\nMonetization options\n\nFurther reading: YouTube SEO: How to Boost Your Channel’s Visibility\n\nDailymotion\n\nDailymotion is the most popular video player in Europe and has 400 million monthly active users.\n\nJust like YouTube, the platform offers social sharing tools. And flexible monetization options. It also allows creators to stream live videos. And add subtitles or closed captions.\n\nBut what makes Dailymotion stand out is its emphasis on short-form video content and animations.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Dailymotion is less competitive than YouTube. This means you may find it easier to build an audience. Especially if you're targeting European consumers.\n\nKey features\n\nUnlimited free hosting\nPopular among European consumers\nAudience analytics and engagement tools\nMake your videos public, private, or password-protected\nIdeal for short videos\nSupports 4K and HTML5 video formats\nAllows livestreaming\nVimeo\n\nVimeo has a strong selection of business features.

But you can use it to publish and share your content for free. Given its large audience, it can make it easier to get more eyes on your videos. And raise brand awareness.\n\nHowever, Facebook has more limited features and tools for video creators than other platforms. While it's great for sharing social content videos, you may need to use third-party tools. To edit and fine-tune your work.\n\nLike Adobe Express, FlexClip, or Canva. \n\nKey Features\n\nUnlimited file storage\nShare content directly with your fans and followers\nJetpack VideoPress\n\nThe Jetpack plugin has a paid feature called VideoPress. Which allows WordPress users to host and share video content.\n\nWith VideoPress, you can embed videos into your WordPress posts.

Include a mix of owned and paid channels. \n\nFurther reading: The Ultimate 2024 Guide to Content Distribution (+ Examples)\n\nOwned Channels\n\nThese are marketing channels you have full control over. You own them. And you have the freedom to make your own rules.\n\nThe most common types of owned media include:\n\nWebsites\nLanding pages\nBlogs\nEmail\n\nSharing videos on these channels can be a great way to diversify your content. And provide more value to your audience.\n\nFurther reading: What Owned Media Is and How to Master It in 6 Easy Steps\n\nPaid Channels\n\nPaid media involves paying Google, Facebook, or other third parties to promote your content. Paid channels are the platforms where your content will appear.\n\nThe biggest benefit of paid media is that it allows for more targeted marketing. \n\nFor example, companies can use paid advertising to target specific audience demographics. Such as 20- to 25-year-old men who live in Orlando, Florida, make at least $150,000 per year, and love photography.\n\nConsider using one or more of the following channels. Depending on your budget and goals:\n\nDisplay ads: This type of advertising allows you to promote your brand or products on third-party websites and apps. Incorporate videos into your ads. To make them engaging and spark curiosity.\nOut-stream video ads: These are mobile-only ads that appear within editorial content. For example, Forbes and other business websites may feature out-stream ads related to entrepreneurship. The videos play automatically. Putting your brand or products in front of potential customers.\nIn-stream video ads: These appear within other videos on online platforms. Like Facebook and YouTube. Viewers see them before, during, or after watching the main video. Depending on the platform. For example, YouTube may display a 30-second video ad before showing the video you clicked on.\nInterstitial video ads: Use these types of ads to display your videos on mobile apps. The ad will take up the full screen and grab viewers' attention.\nNative ads: These ads integrate seamlessly with the platform where they appear. They're relevant to the page content. And don't disrupt the viewer's experience. Think about the ads that appear in your Facebook feed. Or at the top of Google search results.\nSponsored content: Reach out to influencers, online newspapers, and media outlets that publish sponsored content. If you reach an agreement, they'll share your videos on their websites. Or social media pages. As a result, you may gain exposure and reach a wider audience.\nInfluencer marketing: Partner with influencers in your niche or industry to create video content together. Influencer marketing can help you expand your reach. And build credibility. \n\nNote\n\nEach of these video distribution methods has pros and cons. What works for one brand may not work for another. Research your options, test one method at a time, and track the results. After that, focus on the channels that deliver the most value.\n\nMeasure Video Marketing Performance\n\nOnce your video is live, you'll want to see how it performs on different platforms. This will allow you to channel your efforts in the right direction.\n\nFirst, decide which metrics you want to track:\n\nView count: The total number of times a video has been viewed\nPlay rate: The percentage of people who clicked the play button\nEngagement rate: The number of clicks, likes, and shares your video got on social media\nClick-through rate (CTR): The percentage of views that resulted in a click\nVideo completion rate (VCR): The percentage of viewers who watched an entire video\nConversion rate: The percentage of customers who took the desired action, such as joining your email list after watching a video\nBounce rate: The percentage of people who leave a video without watching it in full\nTime on page: The amount of time someone stays on a webpage\n\nMost platforms feature built-in analytics tools that enable users to track these metrics. This includes Facebook Audience Insights, Twitter Analytics, YouTube Analytics, and more. \n\nPlus, there are third-party tools that consolidate all your data in one place.\n\nStart with Semrush's Social Tracker.\n\nThis tool allows you to monitor your competitors' social media accounts. And see how you measure against them. Learn the number of viewers who watch and interact with their videos.\n\nSocial Tracker also shows how many shares, reactions, and comments a video got over the past 60 days. Or 30 days for YouTube. Plus other useful stats. Such as subscriber growth rate and top-performing content.\n\nThere’s also a Social Analytics tool that can track video performance. On LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram. Users can monitor the number of new followers, profile interactions, audience engagement, and other metrics.\n\nStreamline Video Marketing Analysis\n\nwith a Semrush Social Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\nVideo Marketing Tips for Social Media\n\nCreating a social media video marketing strategy will help you drive brand awareness, engagement, and sales.\n\n Here are some tips to keep in mind.\n\nLeverage Visuals \n\nAs many as 83% of people watch videos with the sound off. This percentage is even higher among mobile users (92%).\n\nUse strong visuals, captions, and subtitles to get your point across. Integrate your company’s colors, logos, and other visual elements. To help make your brand memorable. \n\nWatch your videos before sharing them on social media. To ensure they’re engaging and your message is clear. \n\nTasty, a food network company, creates recipe videos you can watch. With or without sound. They use bold text overlays and captions to highlight essential details. \n\nUse Short Videos to Drive Engagement\n\nShort-form video content tends to perform better on social media than longer videos.\n\nFor example, Instagram Reels get more likes than other types of content on the platform. \n\nIn general, short-form video content is under 60 seconds long. And works for sharing quick tips, makeup tutorials, product teasers, or cooking hacks.\n\nThis type of content can complement longer videos. Giving viewers a taste of your brand.\n\nFor instance, create a 30-minute video on starting a business. And a short 60-second video summarizing its key takeaways.\n\nHook Viewers \n\nIn one survey, about 50% of TikTok users said videos longer than 60 seconds are stressful. Approximately one-third reported watching online videos at double speed.\n\nStart your videos with an interesting fact, a breaking news story, bold visuals, or other attention-grabbing elements. Get to the point quickly. To keep viewers’ interest. \n\nLike our video on the most popular search terms. It starts out with unexpected visuals. And a high-energy host. \n\nOptimize Videos for Different Screen Sizes\n\nTo ensure your videos look good on any device, check the requirements of each social media platform.\n\nFor example, if you plan to share content on Instagram, use the following:\n\n16:9 aspect ratio for landscape videos\n4:5 for portrait feed videos\n1:1 for square videos.\n\nTikTok recommends filming your video in portrait (9:16). So it fits any screen size.\n\nDecide which platforms you want to focus on. And then resize your videos accordingly.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse online tools like Kapwing, OpenShot, Veed, or Flixier to optimize your content for different screen sizes. Also, note that Vimeo and other video hosting platforms have built-in editing tools.\n\nAdapt Videos to Different Social Media Channels\n\nOne aspect to consider in the video pre-production process is where you're going to share your content.\n\nFacebook, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media channels all have distinct requirements. By adapting your content to each platform, you can grow your reach. And improve the viewer experience.\n\nInstagram Video Best Practices\nKeep your videos around 60 seconds for Stories, 90 seconds for Reels, and up to four hours for livestreams. Instagram Feed Video Posts can be three seconds to 60 minutes long.\nShoot vertical videos in HD for Instagram Reels. Optimize them with hashtags, product tags, and captions that include your target keywords.\nUse MP4 or MOV for feed videos, Reels, and Stories. These shouldn't exceed 4GB.\nKeep the caption under 2,200 characters for Reels and in-feed videos. And 125 characters for Stories.\nCheck Instagram’s Explore page. Incorporate the latest trends into your content. If possible, use a trending audio track to gain more exposure on the platform.\nRespond quickly to comments, direct messages, and videos that mention your brand\n\nFurther reading: 6 Instagram SEO Tips to Increase Your Reach\n\nFacebook Video Best Practices\nEnsure your videos have the highest possible resolution. And can keep viewers hooked for at least 60 seconds.\nUse an aspect ratio of 16:9 to 9:16 for Facebook feed, in-stream, and Marketplace videos. And 1.91:1 to 9:16 for Facebook Stories.\nStick to 240 seconds for in-feed and Marketplace videos. Five to 120 seconds for in-stream videos. And one to 120 seconds for Stories.\nPost new videos at least once a week to build your audience\nRefrain from explicitly asking viewers to like, share, or tag your content. Foster a sense of community. By encouraging them to share their opinions, leave feedback, or ask questions about the video.\nTease upcoming content to build anticipation and engagement. For example, say something like, \"Stay tuned for our next video, where we'll tell you more about [insert topic].\"\nLeverage Facebook's Watch Parties, polls, livestreaming, and other interactive features. These elements can help you build engagement. Without explicitly asking for likes or shares.\nIf your video marketing campaigns revolve around Facebook, upload your videos directly to the platform rather than linking to YouTube. You can post the same video on both platforms, but upload it to one channel at a time.\n\nYouTube and Facebook are competitors, and their ranking algorithms tend to prioritize native videos. This type of content often gets more exposure and engagement than non-native videos.\n\nImage Source: Facebook\n\nX (Twitter) Video Best Practices\nKeep your videos under two minutes and 20 seconds. X favors short messages, whether in written or video form. The ideal video length is around 15 seconds.\nAdd strong visuals to reinforce your message. And keep viewers hooked.\nShowcase your business or products within the first three seconds to improve brand recall\nAim for an aspect ratio of 16:9 or 1:1 to make sure your videos display in full\nUse the Media Studio. To create compelling video titles, descriptions, links, and interactive elements for your videos.\nAdd captions to reach a wider audience. Including people who are hard of hearing or deaf. And those watching your videos on mute.\nInclude no more than two hashtags per tweet. These should summarize your message and incorporate relevant keywords (e.g., #ketobrownies or #homeimprovement). Adding too many hashtags can make your post look spammy.\n\nImage Source: Twitter\n\nLinkedIn Video Best Practices\nLinkedIn videos can be anywhere between 75KB and 5GB. Keep them under 10 minutes if you upload them via the LinkedIn mobile app. Or under 15 minutes if you upload them via the LinkedIn website.\nChoose the ideal video length based on your goals. LinkedIn recommends using short, 30-second videos for brand awareness. And longer videos for demand generation.\nAim for an aspect ratio of 1:2.4 to 2.4: and a resolution of 256x144 to 4096x2304. To make sure your videos look great on any device.\nUpload your content directly to the platform. Remember that LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, and other social media channels favor native videos.\nAdd supporting copy and hashtags to your videos. For best results, keep your copy under 150 characters.\nCreate and share videos aimed at business professionals. These could be industry news, behind-the-scenes shots, product updates, or insider coverage of relevant events. You can also spotlight inspiring employees.\n\nImage Source: LinkedIn\n\nTikTok Video Best Practices\nThe videos you create on TikTok cannot exceed 60 seconds. But if you upload a video from your computer or smartphone, it can be up to three minutes long. TikTok Stories can last up to 15 seconds.\nShare high-resolution videos (720p or higher) in portrait mode. Use sound to enhance their appeal on the platform.\nBuild your narrative around the latest trends on TikTok. About 77% of users say they prefer brand content featuring trends, memes, or challenges.\nStrike a balance between promotional and educational content. Most users turn to TikTok for entertainment. You risk losing their interest if your videos are too sales-oriented.\nIf you plan to use TikTok video ads, update them at least once a week. When consumers see the same ad over and over again, they may become bored and disengaged.\nTikTok features auto-generated captions, creator captions, and text-to-speech. Leverage these features to make your video content accessible to everyone.\nAdd hashtags like #ad, #promotion, or #sponsored when promoting products or services in your videos. The Federal Trade Commission requires advertisers and influencers to disclose any relationships they have with a brand.\n\nImage Source: Tik Tok\n\nFurther reading: The Hooks of Viral TikToks\n\nPinterest Video Best Practices\nPinterest videos can be up to 15 minutes long. However, the platform recommends keeping your video ads between six and 15 seconds for maximum impact.\nCraft video titles of up to 100 characters. And descriptions of no more than 500 characters.\nUse eye-catching cover images for video pins and add captions. These elements can help users who watch your videos without sound get a better understanding of the content.\nMake your brand or product the focal point of the video. Add your brand colors, fonts, logo, and text overlays to every video pin.\nShare videos that encourage some sort of action. Whether it's buying a product, trying a hack, or starting a project.\nConsider repurposing your Instagram Stories, Reels, and TikTok content into video pins. This type of content is short, catchy, and actionable. Which makes it ideal for Pinterest.\nOrganize your video pins by topic or category. And publish them on relevant boards.\n\nImage Source: Pinterest\n\nLive Video Best Practices \nConsider using Switchboard Live, StreamYard, Wirecast, or BoxCast to stream to multiple platforms at once. These apps also include video editing tools, video player embedding, screen sharing, and other features that can streamline your work.\nLet your followers know about upcoming livestreams. Promote the video in advance to build excitement and increase viewership.\nTeam up with an influencer or industry expert to host the live broadcast. This would allow you to leverage their audience to promote your brand or products.\nEncourage viewers to engage with your video. Encourage them to ask questions. Or share their thoughts in the comments section. \nWhile live videos rely on spontaneity, you should still have a plan. Draft a brief outline that highlights your key points, goals, and CTAs. And let it guide your stream. Think of it as a road map rather than a script.\nDouble-check equipment before going live. Test your mic, lighting, and camera to make sure everything works as expected.\nSave your live videos to repurpose them later on. For example, you could add captions, background music, and graphics. And then share them on social media.\n\nPro tip\n\nFacebook, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media platforms offer live analytics. Use these insights to measure the impact of your livestreams. For instance, track the number of views, comments, likes, shares, and clicks.\n\nUnlock the Power of Video Marketing\n\nVideo marketing is an asset to any brand. Whether you use AI Video Marketing Automator to turn your blog posts into videos. Or create a large-scale production. \n\nHelp your videos reach a wider audience by targeting keywords with Keyword Magic Tool. And track essential metrics. Like shares and plays.
