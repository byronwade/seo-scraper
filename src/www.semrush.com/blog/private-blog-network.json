  "title": "Private Blog Networks (PBNs): What Are They & Do They Work?",
  "content": "What Is a PBN?\n\nA private blog network (PBN) is a group of websites that only exists to provide backlinks to another website and improve its Google search rankings. The idea is to artificially boost the perceived authority of the website in the eyes of search engines.\n\nSEOs create PBNs by building new websites or buying old domains that are already authoritative.\n\nAnd then linking from those domains to the website(s) that they want to boost.\n\nPeople who use PBNs typically use this tactic to be in \"full control\" of their link building efforts.\n\nThink about it this way:\n\nRather than earning links, a private blog network means you can point links to your site at will, with the exact anchor text you want, whenever you want. And to whichever page needs boosting.\n\nSounds great, right? \n\nWrong. \n\nUsing PBNs for SEO clearly violate Google's Webmaster Quality Guidelines and can result in harsh penalties.\n\nBut people still use them and talk about them. Why?\n\nLet’s get into it. \n\nEarn Backlinks from Quality Sites\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nPBNs Violate Google's Webmaster Quality Guidelines\n\nWe recommend that you avoid using PBNs altogether as a link building tactic.\n\nGoogle’s link spam guidelines state:\n\n“Any links that are intended to manipulate rankings in Google Search results may be considered link spam. This includes any behavior that manipulates links to your site or outgoing links from your site.”\n\nPrivate blog networks clearly fall within this guidance. \n\nLinks from PBNs try to manipulate Google search results. These links aren't earned. They’re placed by someone acting on behalf of your site.\n\nPBN websites don’t offer any real value. They’re just designed to “beat the system.” \n\nThe best way to earn high-quality, relevant links is to create unique, valuable content.\n\nAnd creating good content pays off. People will naturally want to link to useful content. \n\nPlus, most people’s real websites are likely more authoritative than spammy PBN sites. \n\nPBN links aren't editorially placed links as the result of great content. \n\nThey’re a way to impact search rankings artificially. And it's not something that’ll work in the long term. \n\nTo check if a particular website has backlinks from PBNs, use Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool.\n\nOpen the tool, enter the website URL, and click “Analyze.”\n\nThen, go to the “Network Graph” tab. You’ll see a color-coded graph depicting a backlink network.\n\nIf you see red dots in the network, that means the website is using PBNs and violating Google’s guidelines. \n\nCheck Whether the Website Is Using PBNs\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nThe Risks Associated with Private Blog Networks\n\nSo, if PBN links violate Google's guidelines, what are the risks? \n\nWe can break these down into two key scenarios:\n\n1. Your Site Is Penalized/Loses Rankings\n\nWhen manipulative link building tactics are excessive, your site may be penalized and hit with a manual action.\n\nAnd if that happens, your pages (or entire site) can be ranked lower or even completely omitted from search results. \n\nIf your site is affected, Google will notify you in the \"Manual Actions\" report in Google Search Console. \n\nLike this:\n\n(Source: Barry Schwartz’s post on X, formerly Twitter)\n\nTo recover from a manual action, you'll need to fix the issue (remove links or submit a disavow file) and file a reconsideration request.\n\nEven if the reconsideration is successful, your page may not return to its original rankings. Your best bet is to create helpful, relevant content in an attempt to achieve better rankings.\n\nPro tip: Only disavow pages if you have received an “unnatural link” manual action. Or if you know that you have unnatural links and want to get ahead of the notification. Disavowing pages affect rankings, so always follow Google’s guidelines and proceed with extreme caution.\n\n2. The Links Are Ignored \n\nIf Google’s algorithm deems a backlink unnatural, it can also completely ignore it. Which means the link won’t have an impact on your rankings. Positively or negatively.\n\nGoogle's John Mueller has previously confirmed that Google ignores links that are unlikely to be natural. \n\nAnd let's not forget that Google now has the data from large numbers of disavow files. For many years, SEOs have been helping the search engine better understand the sources of unnatural links.\n\nWe already ignore links from sites like that, where there are unlikely to be natural links. No need to disavow :)\n\n— John Mueller is mostly not here 🐀 (@JohnMu)\nDecember 2, 2019\n\nIf links aren’t impacting rankings at all, resources allocated to building these (time and/or money) are effectively wasted.\n\nNo one wants to see their efforts go to waste. \n\nWhy Would Someone Use a Private Blog Network?\n\nGiven the associated risks, you're probably wondering why some SEOs still use private blog networks to get backlinks. \n\nMainly for two reasons:\n\n1. Earning Links Is Difficult and Unpredictable\n\nEarning quality backlinks takes time. And results aren't guaranteed.\n\nThe link building tactics that result in quality and authoritative links are typically: \n\nEmail outreach\nDigital PR\nBroken link building\nLink reclamation\nResource link building\nEtc.\n\nThese tactics have one thing in common: \n\nThey involve reaching out to relevant journalists, bloggers, or website owners and trying to convince them to link to your content. \n\nThese techniques are all about raising awareness of a piece of content. And hoping the recipient likes it enough to link to it. \n\nBut this means the results are unpredictable. \n\nEven the best efforts can't guarantee to return a set number of links per month or quarter. \n\nUsing a PBN, on the other hand, can appear to provide more control and less uncertainty. But again, we recommend avoiding it in favor of earning quality backlinks.\n\n2. A Desire to Control and Manipulate Anchor Text\n\nAnchor text is the text in a hyperlink—usually underlined—that leads to another page when clicked. \n\nAnd relevant, descriptive anchor text can help Google understand the context of a page. And possibly help improve its ranking.\n\nWhich is why some folks turn to PBNs. Many PBN owners will allow you to choose the anchor text you want for each backlink.\n\nIf you earn links editorially, you'll find journalists and webmasters will sometimes use anchor text like:\n\n“Click here”\nAn article's title \nA naked URL\nA business name\n\nAnd SEOs, understandably, would prefer keyword-rich anchor text.\n\nThey want backlinks with keyword-rich anchor text that provides Google with context about the page. Which is almost impossible to control through outreach. \n\nDebunking Myths Around PBNs\n\nDespite the risks associated with PBNs, there's still a lot of confusion in the SEO community.\n\nBelow, we bust four common PBN myths.\n\nMyth 1: Private Blog Network Links Won't Help You Rank\n\nWhile links from a private blog network violate Google's guidelines, they can still help you rank. \n\nThere’s a good chance they’ll boost your site's rankings. But the increase is likely only temporary.\n\nBuilding links using a PBN is risky. And in the worst-case scenario, your rankings will plummet once Google discovers them.\n\nIf the algorithm (or a manual reviewer) detects unnatural activity, you'll likely see a steep decline in your site's visibility on Google’s SERPs.\n\nMyth 2: Google Can Easily Identify Private Blog Networks\n\nGoogle can identify private blog networks in several ways. They mainly look for footprints across sites that may signal a group of sites meant solely for link generation.\n\nThe footprints they look for include:\n\nShared IP addresses\nSame web hosting provider\nDomains purchased from auction sites\nBlocking third-party link analysis tools\nEtc. \n\nBut SEOs building private blog networks know how Google typically spots PBNs. And work to prevent (or eliminate) these footprints as much as possible. \n\nBut that’s beside the point. \n\nGoogle is getting increasingly better at identifying low-quality links. Regardless of where they come from. PBN or not. \n\nAnd Google will completely ignore these types of backlinks. \n\nSo, even if the PBN doesn’t get penalized, those links won’t count. That’s a lot of time and money down the drain. \n\nIt’s not worth the risk. Low-quality link schemes rarely stand the test of time. \n\nMyth 3: All Paid Links Come From Private Blog Networks\n\nPaid links can certainly come from private blog networks.\n\nWe work in a world where many bloggers openly sell links or sponsored posts. But is every site that sells a link or sponsored post part of a PBN?\n\nAbsolutely not. \n\nThat being said, paying for links is almost always going to be against Google’s official guidelines. \n\nWhether they come from a PBN or not. \n\nMyth 4: All Groups of Sites That Link to Each Other Are PBNs\n\nIt's not uncommon for a business to own more than one website and link those sites to one another. \n\nThese links aren't, for the most part, unnatural. And they don't necessarily form a PBN.\n\nMany companies run more than one website, and it's only natural to want to ensure that visitors to any of the sites discover the other related sites. \n\nLinks to these other websites are often placed in a website’s footer. \n\nIn general, there's no need to be concerned about this. Or any need to stop linking between your properties. \n\nAs long as it's natural and not done in a manipulative way. \n\nA group of sites only becomes a private blog network when the primary objective is to build links to manipulate search results. \n\nWhat Should You Do if Your Website Has Links From PBNs?\n\nIf you believe your site has links from a PBN or other low-quality sources, it's good practice to find them and take action.\n\nFirst, use Semrush’s Backlink Audit tool to identify suspicious links. \n\nStart by entering your domain and creating a project. \n\nThen, head to the “Audit” tab, and you’ll see a box with potential link networks. \n\nClick on “Review backlinks” to see all the potentially harmful backlinks. \n\nThese are links that can come from malicious pages, spam comments, PBNs, link directories, etc. \n\nThe list shows each backlink’s source URL, target URL, anchor text, authority score, and toxicity score.\n\nGoogle’s recommendation is that you simply ignore toxic links. \n\nHowever, if you think a link is harming your site, you can reach out to the site owner and kindly request they take it down. \n\nYou can also disavow links. But you should be extremely careful. Doing so can be very risky to your rankings. \n\nWe only recommend disavowing if you’ve received a Google manual action against your site or think you will because you bought links. \n\nEven then, proceed with extreme caution when disavowing any links in any context. \n\nIf you do choose to disavow, look for the backlink source in the report and click on the “no” symbol.\n\nLike this:\n\nDo this for all the links you want to disavow. \n\nThe tool will compile a list, which you can then upload to Google’s disavow tool. \n\nAgain, if you disavow, please do so with extreme caution. \n\nReview Your Backlinks\n\nwith the Backlink Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Get Links the Right Way\n\nUsing a PBN network isn’t a link building tactic we recommend or endorse. The risks aren’t worth taking.\n\nUse aboveboard link building methods instead. Strategies like outreach, becoming a source, broken link building, and more. \n\nIt takes work. But it’s the best way to build safe, high-quality links to your website. \n\nIf you’d like to learn more, check out these resources:\n\nThe Beginner’s Guide to Link Building\nHow to Use Outreach for Link Building\nBest Practices for Optimizing Anchor Text\n\nBuild Backlinks Easily\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
