  "content": "Ecommerce market research can help you answer questions like:\n\nIs this a viable business idea?\nWhich new products should we launch?\nHow do we reach our target market?\n\nAnd more.\n\nToday, we’re breaking down market research for ecommerce businesses. So you know what to do and where to start.\n\nWhat Is Market Research for Ecommerce?\n\nEcommerce market research involves collecting and analyzing insights about an online market, focusing on products, digital trends, competitors, and consumers. \n\nIt specifically targets the online environment, whereas traditional market research applies to both online and offline businesses. Like a brick-and-mortar store. \n\nInsight from ecommerce market research helps you understand things like which products your market wants. And how competitive (and profitable) the market is. So you can start a new ecommerce business or refine your current offers.\n\nWhy Is Ecommerce Market Research Important?\n\nMarket research for ecommerce businesses gives you insight into your customers, competitors, and trends. \n\nHere are four ways that insight can shape your business.\n\nIdentify New Market Trends\n\nA deep understanding of your market can clue you into different ecommerce trends. Like market shifts, new technology, and evolving customer preferences. \n\nKnowing these trends can help you capitalize on emerging opportunities. And potentially stay ahead of your competitors. \n\nFor example, through research you find out your customers prefer to buy now and pay later.\n\nKnowing this, you might add the option to pay at a later date. Which could encourage people to buy from you over your competitors \n\nBuild Buyer Profiles\n\nEcommerce market research lets you understand your target market. And build detailed customer profiles—a description of your ideal customer.\n\nHere’s an example of a buyer profile:\n\nThese detailed profiles can help you:\n\nDevelop messaging that speaks to your audience’s wants and preferences so they’re more likely to connect with your brand\nCreate products your ideal buyer is interested in using\nImprove customer satisfaction by tailoring your customer experience to buyer needs\n\nTip\n\nUse Semrush’s free persona tool to create buyer profiles.\n\nSpot Opportunities for Differentiation\n\nProduct differentiation is when you distinguish your product from your competition and make it more appealing to your market. To attract more buyers.\n\nThorough research can give you insight into your competitors’ strategies. Including what they do well and where they fall short. \n\nPair this with other types of research (like audience research) and you’ll have a strong sense of how to stand out in your market.\n\nMake Strategic Decisions\n\nMarket research gives you the insight you need to make business decisions on data rather than guesses.\n\nWhich means there may be less risk involved when making decisions.\n\nFor example, say you sell home decor items. Through market research, you learn that customers prefer seeing items in their homes before buying. Knowing this, you might decide to invest in an app that lets customers digitally view items in their home.\n\nWithout this insight, creating such an app could be risky. And might not result in higher sales. \n\nTypes of Ecommerce Market Research\n\nThere are two types of research you can perform: \n\nPrimary: Research you conduct yourself typically through surveys, interviews, and focus groups. You collect this data firsthand from sources—like your market.\nSecondary: Research you collect from reputable third-party sources like government databases, industry stats, company reports, and market research tools. \n\nPrimary research may be more costly and difficult to scale. However, it provides valuable insight directly from your target market. Which can be difficult to find through secondary sources such as previously published insight. As that insight might not be from your target market. \n\nOn the other hand, secondary research is often more affordable and easier to access. But it may not be as specific to your particular needs.\n\nSo, try to get as much research as you can through secondary sources. Then, use primary research to fill in knowledge gaps and answer any remaining questions you have.\n\nTypes of Market Research Data\n\nYou can also collect two types of data from primary and secondary research. Those types are: \n\nQuantitative data: Numerical data (e.g., your customers’ age range, your average product star rating, or the number of your competitor’s social media followers)\nQualitative data: Non-numerical data usually from interviews and discussions (e.g., customer preferences, feelings, and attitudes)\n\nQuantitative data is typically easy to collect, sort, and interpret. As you can turn quantitative data into visuals like charts and graphs. But qualitative data, while harder to analyze, can give you deeper insight.\n\nFor example, you might discover that your competitor’s products average a 2.5/5 star rating.\n\nBut you won’t know why without qualitative data (like customer reviews).\n\nSo, if you find yourself questioning why certain quantitative data is the way it is, seek out qualitative data to uncover the underlying reason.\n\nHow to Do Market Research for Ecommerce Businesses\nPerform Competitor Analysis\n\nCompetitor analysis is when you collect insights for your competitors’ products, audience, and strategies. \n\nThis insight can help you understand your competition’s strengths and weaknesses. So you can figure out how to position your business. And how to better serve your audience.\n\nFirst, you’ll need a list of competitors. Open Semrush’s Market Explorer and click “Find Competitors.” Enter your domain and click “Research a market.”\n\nScroll to the “Growth Quadrant.” You’ll see a matrix of you and your competitors. Categories include:\n\nGame Changers: Emerging sites with a high growth potential\nNiche Players: Small sites with a low growth rate\nLeaders: Sites with fast growth\nEstablished Players: Sites with an established audience \n\nKnowing this can help you identify which sites you may want to pay attention to. For example, it might be worthwhile to review the market strategies of game changers. Who have fast growth. \n\nSo, jot down four competitors you’d like to dive into. \n\nNext, collect information for these competitors on their:\n\nAudience\nMarketing strategies\nProducts\n\nHere’s how.\n\nAudience\n\nOpen Semrush’s Traffic Analytics. Enter your domain and up to four competitor URLs and click “Analyze.”\n\nClick the “Audience Overview” tab. You’ll see information for yourself and your competitors. Including audience demographics, socioeconomics, and behavior.\n\nThen scroll to the “Audience Overlap for” widget and make sure your website is selected. Review the information to see how your audience overlaps with your competition.\n\nLarger overlaps indicate higher competition. As you’re likely to market to the same people. You’ll want to pay closer attention to these competitors and what strategies they use.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Traffic\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nMarketing Strategies\n\nUse Advertising Research to review competitors’ paid ads. Open the tool, enter your domain, and click “Search.”\n\nClick the “Competitors” tab. This shows which of your competitors use Google paid search ads. Including an estimation of their ad spend. This can help you determine how much you may want to allocate to paid search ads.\n\nNext review your competitors’ organic content strategies (non-paid marketing techniques) like:\n\nSocial media marketing: Determine which channels they use, how often they post, and which types of content they publish\nEmail marketing: Sign up for their email list to see which types of content they send to their email list (i.e., coupons, promotional emails, educations emails, etc.) and how often they send emails\nContent marketing: Determine which other content assets they have (i.e., blog posts, podcasts, ebooks, webinars, etc.)\n\nReviewing these strategies can help you understand your audience’s communication preferences. So you know where to focus your efforts. \n\nProducts\n\nFinally, head to your competitors’ online shops and review their products. Including prices and notable features. \n\nRead through customer reviews for each product to see which aspects customers liked. And which ones they didn’t.\n\nThis can clue you into customer preferences. And help you develop and refine your own offers.\n\nFurther reading: Check out our guide on how to perform in-depth competitor analysis.\n\nUnderstand Your Target Audience\n\nAudience research helps you understand what makes your audience tick. So you can effectively market to them, create products and offers they’ll be excited to buy, and retain them as long-time customers.\n\nYou’ll want to get to know your audience in four core areas:\n\nDemographics (age, gender, location, etc.)\nSocioeconomics (income, employment status, etc.)\nOnline behavior (purchasing habits, decision-making process, social media usage, etc.)\nPsychographics (attitudes, lifestyles, aspirations, etc.)\n\nSemrush’s Audience Intelligence app can get you all the info you need. Open the app and click “Let’s start.”\n\nClick “+ Buy reports” and follow the prompts. \n\nAfter purchasing a report you can create a new report. Give your report a name, add an X (formerly Twitter) handle for the audience you want information on, and click “Create new report.”\n\nYou’ll see a high-level report. For more specific details, click “See all clusters.”\n\nThen click “View more details.”\n\nClick into the different tabs along the top (“Demographics,” “Socioeconomics,” “Influencers & brands,” etc.) to learn more about your audience. \n\nFor example, the “Personality” tab has psychographic information. \n\nYou can also collect audience information through:\n\nSurveys: Add surveys to your website that ask visitors questions about their preferences and shopping habits (e.g., “what stopped you from buying today?”)\nCustomer interviews: Host one-on-one interviews with people who have the highest customer lifetime value (people who spend the most amount of money with your customer) to uncover why they keep coming back. And how you can replicate that for other customers. \nInterviews with customer-facing teams: Speak to sales and support staff to see what additional insight they have about your audience. Like pain points and areas of frustration.\nProduct reviews: Read through online reviews to understand what your market wants from your products\n\nFinally, pull all your information together and create buyer profiles of your different buyer personas. Let these personas guide efforts like product creation and marketing. \n\nFurther reading: How to Create Your Buyer Personas \n\nIdentify Trends Within Your Market\n\nDigging into trends can help you spot areas of opportunity—like new viable products. Or shifting market interests. \n\nA few ecommerce market research tools can help:\n\nGoogle Trends: Shows a keyword’s interest overtime plus related searches\nEcommerce Keyword Analytics: Shows keyword data specifically for ecommerce businesses. See how certain keywords convert over time and identify seasonal trends and growing product verticals. \nMarket Explorer: Review trends in competitor growth and see which keywords are trending with your audience\n\nUse these tools to search names of products and related keywords. Then, see if interest for each keyword is growing or shrinking. \n\nConsider pairing this insight with primary research to better understand why your market may be shifting their behavior. \n\nFor example, say you sell computers. And you notice that sales for a specific laptop are spiking. But you don’t know why. \n\nConsider speaking to your audience to uncover why they’re buying this specific model. \n\nMaybe a TikTok video featuring the product went viral. Which could indicate a short-term trend. And might not be a worthwhile investment. But maybe this laptop has new technology that excites your market. And you want to invest in this new technology to attract more customers. \n\nYou can also stay on top of trends by subscribing to (or buying) industry-relevant reports from places like:\n\nEuromonitor\nIBISWorld\nGartner\nNielsen\nForrester\nFind Your Target Keywords\n\nFinding target keywords helps you understand how much organic—unpaid—traffic you can drive to your site. And how much budget you may need to allocate towards the creation of organic content (like blog posts).\n\nTo start, open a keyword research tool like the Keyword Magic Tool. Enter a seed keyword—a broad keyword related to your niche—and your domain. Select your country and click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will give you thousands of keyword ideas. Filter these keywords by using the left hand widget or any of the filters along the top. \n\nNote the column titled “PKD %.” This stands for Personal Keyword Difficulty—the level of difficulty Semrush estimates your site will have ranking for specific keywords. \n\nKeywords with a high difficulty may require more budget. As you’ll likely need to build backlinks—links from external websites that point to your site—to build your authority to rank higher.\n\nHowever, if you have many keywords with low difficulty, you may not need to allocate as much to link building efforts. And may just need to factor content creation into your budget.\n\nAnother column to note is “Intent.” Intent tells you why people search for a term. \n\nThere are four primary search intents: \n\nInformational: The user wants an answer to a specific query\nNavigational: The user wants to find a specific page\nCommercial: The user wants information on specific products or services \nTransactional: The user wants to complete an action (like buy a product)\n\nThis information can help you understand how profitable specific keywords may be. It can also give you deeper audience insight. Such as what questions people have about the products in your industry. Which can give you even more content ideas.\n\nNote\n\nSearch engine optimization—the process of improving your ecommerce site so it ranks highly in search engine results—goes beyond keywords. Our guide on ecommerce SEO gives you additional tips to help your online shop rank well. \n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nAnalyze Social Media \n\nSocial media offers insight into how your market feels about you and your competitors—also known as sentiment.\n\nAnalyzing market sentiment helps you figure out your audience’s biggest pain points. So you can tailor your offers to reduce those pain points. And what your customers want. So you can build those wants into your offer.\n\nTools like Brand Monitoring automatically collect market sentiment for you. \n\nTo start, download the app and click “Get Started.” Then, enter a brand to monitor (your own or a competitor). \n\nNext, add the social media profiles you’d like to monitor for that brand.\n\nClick the “Analytics” tab to view the “Sentiment” widget. This shows you how the market has felt about this brand over time. \n\nAnd click the “Mentions” tab to review market discussions for this brand. This can help you dig into a specific time frame where the brand may have had a spike in positive or negative sentiment. \n\nFor example, say you want to sell premade meals. And competitor sentiment analysis reveals that customers complain about unknown ingredients in their meals. You could potentially make your brand more appealing to your market by highlighting a simple ingredient list on your website. \n\nReview Site Analytics\n\nUse site analytics (from places like Google Analytics) to get deeper insight into your market—and their behavior—after launching your ecommerce site. \n\nFor example, you might notice more users turn to leads from “how to” type blog posts than any other format. Which might indicate your audience likes step-by-step tutorials. Knowing this can guide your content creation strategy.\n\nTurn to Organic Traffic Insights to dig into site analytics. Open the tool, enter your domain, and click “Get Insights.”\n\nGo through the prompts to connect your Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts and configure the tool.\n\nThe tool will display important metrics for your organic search traffic. Like the average number of users, average session duration, and bounce rate. \n\nReview this information to understand which types of content your market prefers. And which pages lead to the most conversions.\n\nUsing Your Market Research\n\nYou’ve done market research for your ecommerce shop and have a pile of data. Now what?\n\nYour first step is to synthesize and summarize your insights. Compile everything into a single document and highlight key findings, trends, and patterns.\n\nThen, use your insight to:\n\nCreate new offers\nOptimize current product offerings\nRefine your marketing strategy\nIdentify new potential markets\nDevelop ad campaigns\n\nBut your first step is to collect the data. And Semrush can help.\n\nTry Semrush’s tools for free and get to know your market, your competitors, and the trends within your industry.\n\nElevate Your Digital Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
