  "content": "Google Analytics is arguably one of the most valuable and powerful tools for website analytics. Let’s explore 35 valuable data insights Google Analytics offers and how you can use them to improve your marketing and SEO.\n\nWhat Is Google Analytics?\n\nGoogle Analytics is a web analytics tool designed to collect user data. It sorts the data into easy-to-read reports via a customizable dashboard.\n\nExample of a custom Google Analytics dashboard\nWhat Is a Metric in Google Analytics?\n\nIn Google Analytics, a metric is a single, measurable piece of data. Metrics can appear in sums or ratios.\n\nSome common Google Analytics metrics include pages per session, screen views, bounce rate, and time on page.\n\nScreenshot of a Google Analytics report\nTypes of Google Analytics Insights \nInsight 1: Active Users on Site\n\nThis metric indicates how many active users are on your site in real-time. You can also use this metric to double-check if you’ve set up Google Analytics correctly on your website. \n\nInsight 2: Top Active Pages\n\nUse this metric to track the most active pages on your website in real-time. If you’ve launched a new blog post and you’ve pushed it through your marketing channels, this metric can indicate if your new content is drawing any traffic.\n\nInsight 3: Goal Conversions \n\nThe Goal conversions metric helps you track conversions on your website. You can also use this report to review any buttons, forms, or transactions used to complete a conversion.\n\n You’ll have to set your goals in Google Analytics first before you can see this data. When a user completes a specific event, Google counts it as a conversion towards your goal. \n\nYou can also use this metric to determine whether your website can track conversions correctly. Note that this metric only tracks conversions completed in the last 30 minutes.\n\nInsight 4: Audience Age\n\nYou’ll mostly use this to understand or refine your target audience. Review this metric to track the average age range of your website’s visitors. \n\nInsight 5: Audience Gender\n\nSimilar to the above, this metric is great for understanding your user demographics. Combine this with other audience metrics to verify your target market is responding to your campaign.\n\nInsight 6: Audience Geographic Location\n\nThis chart tracks the locations of users visiting your site. It can also indicate which language your user’s browsing in. \n\nThis metric can be useful for marketers working on international campaigns who want to better understand their reach. \n\nDepending on the number of international users, you may need to consider an alternate language version of your website. \n\nInsight 7: New vs. Returning Visitors\n\nThis chart easily segments your overall visitors into new or returning visitors. New visitors are visitors that have never landed on your website before. Returning visitors are visitors that have visited your website more than once in the past two years. \n\nAn influx of new visitors can indicate a successful marketing campaign, popular content, or an increase in brand awareness. \n\nReturning visitors can provide more insight into popular pages on your website, valuable content you can repurpose, or even a compelling product to highlight. You can also target returning users with loyalty rewards or a more enticing CTA.\n\nInsight 8: Desktop vs. Mobile \n\nThis chart segments visitors by device. Compare mobile to desktop visitors to determine how visitors primarily access your website. \n\nIf your marketing campaign targets one or the other, this metric can help you track its success. \n\nInsight 9: Users Flow \n\nThis metric shows you the journey of a user on your website. You’ll be able to see which websites lead visitors to yours, or which websites they visited after leaving your site.\n\nInsight 10: Lifetime Value (LTV) of a User\n\nThis insight looks at a user in the first 90 days after they have visited your site. If you have someone sign-up for a service, this metric is essential.\n\nYou can set the metric to measure page views, conversions, or other goals you want to select. You can then start to determine how this user will use your site and be a great customer for you in the future.\n\nInsight 11: Top Acquisition Channels\n\nThis is arguably the most important acquisition metric. This shows your site’s most powerful traffic sources and which campaigns are working, where most of your business is likely coming from.\n\nInsight 12: New Users\n\nThis metric tells you the number of first-time visitors to your website. If you’re launching a new campaign to get new visitors and new signups, this is the metric you need to focus on.\n\nInsight 13: Landing Pages\n\nIf you’re running PPC ads, this metric can show you the effectiveness of your ads or their landing pages. If a blog post or web page suddenly becomes popular, you’ll be able to review their metrics with this chart.\n\nInsight 14: Sessions\n\nA session is a unit of time — usually 30 minutes. This widget tracks how many sessions a user has been active on your website. A single user can have multiple sessions.\n\nInsight 15: Sessions via Social Referrals\n\nHow many sessions were created from a social source, such as Facebook or Instagram? This widget is your best bet for monitoring any social media traffic or campaign results. \n\nInsight 16: Track Specific Campaigns with UTM Tracking\n\nUrchin Tracking Modules (UTM) are unique URLs that track the effectiveness of specific marketing campaigns. \n\nInsight 17: Average Session Duration\n\nThis metric averages the session length of your visitors. It is a helpful metric for comparing different marketing channels and campaigns.\n\nInsight 18: Bounce Rate\n\nThe bounce rate is a percentage of single-page visits or sessions where the user did not interact with the site. High bounce rates indicate users leave your site quickly. \n\nIf you have high bounce rates, you’ll need to create a strategy to help visitors stay on your website longer.\n\nInsight 19: Site Content Metrics\n\nThis shows you which pages on your website people are interacting with the most. It shows you which pages and which content catches people’s attention.\n\nInsight 20: Behavior Flow\n\nThe user flow metric shows the volume of users from different locations. However, Behavior Flow indicates what users do once they land on your website. It can show you the order of pages visited and time spent per page.\n\nDo users follow internal links to other pages? Do they follow a logical path of browsing, adding to the cart, and checking out?\n\nInsight 21: Exit Pages \n\nThis shows you which page users left your site. Use this widget to determine if there’s a specific issue with the page, like a poor call to action, broken links or \n\nInsight 22: Average Page Load Times\n\nThis metric is good for the Core Web Vitals, as page load speed is one of the critical components in Google’s page ranking. \n\nIssues affecting page load speeds can be a slow server, image compression, lazy loading, and page layout shift.\n\nInsight 23: Goal Completions \n\nYou can set up goals with your website. Completion of these goals by users will return this metric to you. These goals can include completing a form, watching a video, or making a purchase\n\nInsight 24: Goal Conversion Rate\n\nLike the previous metric, this gives you a percentage of goals completed by visitors to your website.\n\nInsight 25: Reverse Goal Path\n\nAgain, following up from the above, you can follow the path they took to get there for those who did complete the goals. \n\nThis helps track the user’s journey, and you can find spots along the way to strengthen your message and increase the conversion rate.\n\nInsight 26: Average Ecommerce Order Value\n\nThis insight gives you the average dollar amount per order on your website. It provides a good indicator of the ROI for your marketing campaign and can give you an idea about setting prices for your products and services.\n\nInsight 27: Checkout Behaviour Analysis\n\nThis metric shows you when a customer checks out and pays for their items or leaves the cart entirely. It's suitable for triggering abandoned cart emails and for understanding the customer’s journey.\n\nInsight 28: Multi-Channel Conversions\n\nWith this insight, you can investigate which channels are giving you the most conversions on your website. You can combine channels to give you an overall conversion amount as well.\n\nUse this metric to determine where you should invest more of your marketing budget to get better ROI.\n\nInsight 29: Top Conversion Paths\n\nCheck out what are the most successful paths users take to your website and then conversion. This gives you some insights into your target audience and how well your marketing campaigns are going.\n\nThese insights can also reveal to you a target audience you didn't know you had.\n\nInsight 30: In-Market Segments\n\nWith this insight, you can investigate where Google places your users. “In-market segments” is the same kind of analysis used by Google Ads. These are people who are actively looking for your products and services; Google groups them by their search intent.\n\nInsight 31: Conversion Probability\n\nThis is an interesting metric because it can predict the probability of a user converting through your channels. This gives you insight into which marketing channels are working and hitting the right target audience with your marketing message.\n\nYou can focus more money on the channels which predict higher conversions to get a better ROI and let the lower prediction channels ease off.\n\nInsight 32: On-Site Search Terms\n\nIf your website has search functionality, this insight will tell you what people search for once they land on your website. This allows you to put more resources toward the category or products they’re searching for, build a channel directly to those pages, with marketing and backlinks.\n\nIt can also show you which pages they are searching, if there is a content issue, such as descriptions being misleading or not clear enough for the user.\n\nHidden Insights & Metrics\n\nSome hidden insights and metrics are not immediately available in “out-of-the-box” Google Analytics. Adding some of these metrics can give you insights you might not have known you needed.\n\nInsight 33: Query Word Count (Paid Ads Linking)\n\nYou can integrate your Google Ads account with your Google Analytics account. This allows you to see the number of clicks for a PPC by the word count in a search term.\n\nYou can choose the number of words in a Google Ad, the length of search terms, and help budget for more effective campaigns.\n\nInsight 34: Search Console Queries\n\nLink your Google Search Console with your Google Analytics account to see which search queries your website receives impressions. You can see clicks and view your click-through rate as well.\n\nThis integration means you don’t need to look at your Google Search Console. You can find the information in one place.\n\nInsight 35: Not Provided Keywords\n\nHidden keywords, or ‘not provided’ keywords, are common within Google Analytics. You can find this information under Acquisition. \n\nOur Organic Traffic Insights tool is an excellent workaround as well for this. It can;\n\nCheck landing pages from your GA dashboard where GA showed the not-provided keywords.\nMerges this data with your Google Search Console data for each page.\nAdds keywords that drive traffic to the same pages.\nGives you a list of not-provided keywords.\n\nFor more information about the Organic Traffic Insights tool, check out our knowledge base.\n\nAll of Your Insights in One Place\n\nYou can integrate your Google Analytics account with your SEO Dashboard to see all these great insights in one place.
