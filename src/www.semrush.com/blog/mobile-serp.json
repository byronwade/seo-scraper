  "content": "What Is a Mobile SERP?\n\nA mobile search engine results page (SERP) is the version of the results page that a search engine displays on mobile devices, rather than desktop.\n\nIs the Google Mobile SERP Important?\n\nIt’s important to understand Google’s mobile SERP because it’s the most used search experience of all. Over 60% of searches now occur on mobile devices. And as of October 2023, 91.55% of searches happen on Google. \n\nPlus, Google predominantly uses the mobile version of a website to index and rank it within its results. This is known as mobile-first indexing.\n\nOnce you understand how mobile SERPs work, you’ll be better equipped to optimize your content to perform well on mobile. This can help you win more organic traffic.\n\nGoogle Mobile SERP Features\n\nAlthough they look a little different on mobile devices, SERP features (non-standard elements like those listed below) are mostly the same on mobile as they are on desktop.\n\nThey include (but aren’t limited to):\n\nFeatured snippet\nGoogle Ads\nLocal pack\nVideos\nTop stories\nImages\nKnowledge panel\nPeople Also Ask\nRelated searches\n\nFurther reading: What Are SERP Features? An In-Depth Guide\n\nHere are three differences, though.\n\n1. App Packs Only Exist on Mobile\n\nOne SERP feature that is unique to mobile is the app pack. If a search implies that the user could be looking for an app, links to the app itself are displayed.\n\nApp packs are typically positioned mid-page, below sponsored results, below the first organic result(s), and sometimes below People Also Ask. The exact position varies. \n\nIt looks like this:\n\nThe results are specific to the device’s operating system. Links direct users to the app’s page within the appropriate app store. \n\n2. Some SERP Features Are More Prominent\n\nSome mobile SERP features take up a greater percentage of screen space compared to their desktop SERP counterparts.\n\nFor example, here’s the featured snippet for “how to prepare an interview” on desktop:\n\nNote that the next feature (People Also Ask) is fully visible without scrolling.\n\nOn mobile, it looks like this:\n\nAlmost the entire screen (before scrolling) is taken up by the featured snippet.\n\nThe same is true of local packs, videos, and other features.\n\nBecause of their prominence on screen, it’s likely that SERP features on mobile get a greater share of the overall clicks than they do on desktop.\n\n3. Some Google SERP Features Appear More (or Less) Often on Mobile\n\nAlthough most of the Google SERP features exist on both desktop and mobile, they don’t always appear at the same frequencies.\n\nIn this Semrush study on ecommerce SERP features, we found certain features appeared more in desktop SERPs, while others appeared more in mobile SERPs.\n\nFor example: \n\nRelated products appeared in 99% of desktop SERPs but only 76% of mobile SERPs. The average number of products shown was also higher (five on desktop vs. four on mobile).\n\nThe buying guide feature (an expandable list of product-related questions) was also more frequently displayed on desktop versus mobile. (7% and 6% of the time, respectively.)\n\nOn the flip side, local packs were seen more frequently on mobile devices (31% vs. 26% on desktop).\n\nHow to Check if Your Site Has Google Mobile SERP Features \n\nIf you want to check whether your website appears in any mobile Google SERP features, you can use Semrush’s Position Tracking.\n\nIt gives you an overview of your organic rankings for a set of target keywords. And it monitors your site’s appearance in Google SERP features.\n\nTo set it up, head to the Position Tracking tool, enter your domain name, then click “Set up tracking.”\n\nYou’ll select configuration options in the “New Position Tracking Campaign” pop-up menu.\n\nIn the “Targeting” tab, be sure to choose “Google” as your search engine and “Mobile” as your device type.\n\nIn the “Keywords” tab, add the specific keywords you want to monitor. Be sure to include the ones you think may trigger an appearance in a Google SERP feature. \n\nOnce everything is set up, “Start Tracking.”\n\nThen head to the “Overview” report.\n\nTo check Google SERP features, scroll past the graph to the “Rankings Overview” table.\n\nThe column titled “SF” displays information about the SERP features shown for that keyword.\n\nThe number indicates how many SERP features are present. Clicking it shows which they are.\n\nClicking the icon next to the number lets you see what the SERP actually looks like for users.\n\nTo quickly view all the tracked keywords where your site displays in Google SERP features, use the “SERP Features” drop-down filter. Select “yourdomain.com ranks.”\n\nGoogle Mobile SERP Design\n\nThe mobile SERP adapts to suit smaller screen sizes in various ways. \n\nHere are three unique-to-mobile design elements. \n\n1. No Sidebars\n\nSome Google SERP features, like a knowledge panel, appear in the right sidebar on desktop SERPs.\n\n(A knowledge panel displays a short overview about a topic, brand, or business without requiring the user to click.)\n\nOn mobile, since there isn’t space for two columns, they appear at the top instead.\n\nThe same is true for Google Business Profiles. On desktop, the profile appears in the right sidebar:\n\nWhile on mobile, the profile appears above the organic results:\n\n2. Shorter Meta Descriptions, Longer Title Tags\n\nThe anatomy of a regular, organic result is the same on mobile as it is on desktop.\n\nOrganic results consist of:\n\nWebsite name\nTitle tag\nMeta description\nFavicon (logo image)\nURL path\nSometimes other Google SERP features like reviews (shown below) or sitelinks\n\nHowever, titles and descriptions display at different maximum lengths on mobile SERPs. \n\nThere’s no actual limit for the number of characters in a title tag or meta description. But there is a point after which Google will cut off characters when they’re too long. \n\nLike this:\n\nOn mobile SERPs, the meta descriptions are cut off sooner than they are on desktop.\n\nOn desktop, meta descriptions cut off at approximately 960 pixels or 152 characters. On mobile, they cut off after approximately 680 pixels or 105 characters. Which means it’s best to stick with a limit of 105 characters.\n\nAnd title tags?\n\nMobile SERPs can technically display longer ones because they can use multiple lines.\n\nHere’s an example of a title tag that is cut off on desktop:\n\nBut not on mobile:\n\nTitle tags are cut off after around 600 pixels on desktop, which is about 60 characters. While they can be longer on mobile devices, it’s best to stick with that threshold to ensure your title tags don’t get truncated on any device. \n\n3. Tap-to-Call Buttons\n\nFor convenience, some Google mobile SERP features let users initiate a call in one tap. They’re mostly seen when searching for a local business.\n\nGoogle Ads can also contain tap-to-call buttons, which look like this:\n\nGoogle Business Profiles have tap-to-call buttons too, which look like this:\n\nChanges to the Google Mobile SERP Design\n\nGoogle regularly makes small tweaks to the mobile SERP design. And often runs experiments.\n\nHere are three notable changes to the mobile SERP that impacted user experience.\n\n1. Google’s 2021 Mobile SERP Redesign\n\nOne significant design update from early 2021 was well documented.\n\nKey changes included:\n\nLarger, bolder text for accessibility and easier scanning\nEdge-to-edge results for more visual space and a modern look\nRounded icons and corners, aligning with Google’s branding\n\nImage Source: Google\n\n2. Continuous Scrolling\n\nGoogle removed pagination from their SERPs. Instead of tapping “See More,” “Next,” or a page number after 10 organic results, more now load automatically.\n\nAs a result, it’s likely that results in position 11 or lower get a small increase in visibility.\n\nThis change was introduced first to mobile in late 2021. It rolled out on desktop in late 2022.\n\nNote\n\n“Continuous scrolling” doesn’t mean infinite scrolling. After a while (usually four pages), the user still needs to click “More search results.”\n\n3. Adding Website Names and Favicons\n\nPrior to 2019, branding wasn’t clear for organic listings.\n\nAfter a Google SERP design update (which came to mobile first), two new elements were added:\n\nWebsite name\nFavicon (logo image)\n\nIt’s useful for searchers to see at a glance who is the publisher of the content. That way, they can quickly identify familiar brands. Or assess credibility.\n\nImage Source: Google\n\nHow to Preview Mobile Search Results for Keywords of Interest\n\nIf you want to see what mobile search results look like for a specific keyword of interest, you can use a tool like Keyword Overview.\n\nThis is more reliable than trying to create the experience on your own device since location affects search results. The SERP you see on your mobile device might not be the same if you’re not searching from your target location.\n\nStart by entering your target keyword and choosing the target country.\n\nYou’ll get useful information like average number of searches per month, Keyword Difficulty (how much SEO effort it would take to rank in the top 10 results), and more.\n\nNext, click the “Desktop” drop-down and switch to “Mobile.”\n\nThen, scroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section, and click “View SERP.”\n\nYou’ll get something that looks like this, simulating a real mobile search for your target keyword in your target location.\n\nLearn to Conquer the Mobile SERP\n\nInterested in increasing your visibility on mobile SERPs and getting more traffic to your site?
