  "content": "What Is NLP? \n\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that helps computers understand, interpret, and interact with language. And involves processing and analyzing large amounts of natural language data.\n\nIn SEO, NLP is used to analyze context and patterns in language to understand words’ meanings and relationships.\n\nThis helps search engines better understand what users are looking for (i.e., search intent) when they search a given term. And deliver relevant results.\n\nFor example, Google uses NLP to help it understand that a search for “aluminum bats” is referring to baseball clubs. Not winged animals.\n\nAnd it shows search results that demonstrate this understanding.\n\nNLP also plays a crucial role in Google results like featured snippets. And allows the search engine to extract precise information from webpages to directly answer user questions.\n\nAll this ultimately enhances searchers’ experiences. And ensures websites can effectively reach those searchers.\n\nHow Does NLP Work? \n\nNatural language processing integrates machine learning, linguistics, and AI to help machines understand and process human language.\n\nGenerally speaking, NLP involves gathering unstructured data, preparing the data, selecting and training a model, testing the model, and deploying the model.\n\nHere's an overview of some of the main concepts involved:\n\nTokenization: Breaking down text into smaller units (like words or sentences)\nStemming and lemmatization: Converting words into their root forms \nPart-of-speech tagging: Assigning a grammatical category to each word (i.e., noun, verb, adjective)\nNamed entity recognition: Identifying entities like names, dates, and locations within the text\nDependency parsing: Analyzing the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence to understand its structure\nSemantic analysis: Extracting the meaning of the text considering factors like context, synonyms, and antonyms\n\nIn 2019, Google’s work in this space resulted in Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models that were applied to search. Which led to a significant advancement in understanding search intentions.\n\nAs a result, modern search results are based on the true meaning of the query. \n\nThis means content creators now need to produce high-quality, relevant content. Not just content that exactly matches certain words. \n\nExamples of How Google Uses NLP in Search\n\nHere are some of the main ways Google applies NLP to search and search results:\n\nIdentifying the Meaning of Queries and Pages\n\nGoogle introduced its neural matching system to better understand how search queries are related to pages—even when different terminology is used between the two.\n\nFor example, the query “eating based on what your body wants” describes a concept called intuitive eating. But searchers may not be familiar with that phrasing.\n\nGoogle recognizes that and serves results accordingly:\n\nYou can probably see why Google’s Danny Sullivan referred to it as “super synonyms.”\n\nRecognizing Entities\n\nEntities are items like people, places, and things. And Google's search algorithms work to determine whether a user is trying to find information about an entity.\n\nIf so, Google can extract relevant information from reliable content and display it in results. And possibly in a knowledge panel—a type of rich result that appears to the side of standard search results. \n\nLike this:\n\nNotice that the user doesn’t even need to know the exact name of the entity to find what they’re looking for.\n\nProviding More Direct Answers\n\nGoogle’s NLP and other systems decide when generative responses would be helpful for a particular query. And when they are, excerpts are written using AI technology that draws on the Gemini language model.\n\nThese AI-generated summaries appear above all other search results. \n\nThey’re intended to help searchers find the information they need without having to sift through multiple webpages. But also include links to the content the summaries are sourced from.\n\nHow to Optimize Your Content with NLP in Mind\n\nYou can significantly increase your chances of performing well in search by considering the way search engines use NLP as you create content.\n\nHere’s how:\n\n1. Analyze Search Intent \n\nSearch intent is the purpose behind a user's search query. And understanding it is crucial for creating content that meets users' needs and ranks well in search results.\n\nThese are the four main types of search intent:\n\nIntent \n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nInformational (I)\n\n\t\n\nSearchers are looking for information about something\n\n\t\n\n“how to adopt a dog”\n\n\n\n\nNavigational (N)\n\n\t\n\nSearchers are looking for a specific website or webpage\n\n\t\n\n“spotify login”\n\n\n\n\nCommercial (C)\n\n\t\n\nSearchers are analyzing various options prior to purchasing\n\n\t\n\n“best office chairs under $250”\n\n\n\n\nTransactional (T)\n\n\t\n\nSearchers are looking to buy something\n\n\t\n\n“buy yoga mat online”\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Overview to effectively analyze search intent for any keyword you’re creating content for. \n\nEnter your target keyword and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see the “Intent” metric near the top.\n\nSemrush estimates the intent based on the words within the keyword that signal intention, whether the keyword is branded, and the SERP features the keyword ranks for.\n\nOnce you have a general understanding of intent, analyze the search engine results page (SERP) and study the content you see. \n\nTo do that, scroll down to the “SERP Analysis” section and click “View SERP” to see the actual search results.\n\nThis gives you a better overview of what the SERP looks like for your target keyword. To help you more fully understand what searchers are interested in.\n\nNext, visit the top-ranking pages to find out:\n\nHow do these pages structure the content? And what topics are covered?\nWhat content types and formats are used? Are the results blog posts, product pages, or something else? \nHow is your target keyword used? And how does that help you better understand the context behind user queries?\nWhat common themes and questions do these pages address? And how can you use this information to guide your own content creation? \n\nBy understanding the answers to these questions, you can tailor your content to better match what users are searching for. \n\nAnalyze & Understand Search Intent\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Answer Your Audience’s Questions\n\nUsers often search keywords that are formatted as questions. And there are likely several that are relevant to your main keyword. \n\nThat means answering these questions can help you gain more visibility. And have your content appear in featured snippets, AI Overviews, and People Also Ask (PAA) sections.\n\nLike this:\n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool to find common questions related to your topic. \n\nEnter your target keyword in the text field. Then, select the location and click “Search.”\n\nNext, select the “Questions” tab. \n\nNow, you’ll have a list of question terms that are relevant to your target keyword. \n\nYou can further narrow down your list by filtering these keywords based on relevant SERP features. \n\nClick the “Advanced filters” drop-down, select the “Any” drop-down under “SERP Features,” and tick the boxes next to any SERP features you want to focus on.\n\nThis way, you can identify question-based keywords that are relevant to your topic. So you can include them and their answers in your content. \n\nWhen crafting your answers, it’s a good idea to take inspiration from the answer currently appearing for those questions. Which might mean using bullet points, numbered lists, etc. \n\nFind Ranking Opportunities\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Include Entities in Your Content\n\nIncorporating entities in your content signals to search engines that your content is relevant to certain queries. Which can improve your SEO performance. \n\nFor example, if you’re writing a travel blog focused on planning a trip to Paris, it’s a good idea to mention entities like “Eiffel Tower,” “Louvre Museum,” and “Palace of Versailles.”\n\nKeyword research often uncovers some relevant entities.\n\nFind even more (as well as some additional semantic keywords) using the SEO Content Template.\n\nEnter your main keyword. And click the “Create content template” button.\n\nThe tool will offer recommendations for terms (including entities) based on the top-ranking pages for your target keyword. \n\nLike this:\n\nBut don’t go overboard. Because it might look forced or over-optimized for search. \n\nInstead, aim for a smooth and informative piece.\n\nGet Content Recommendations\n\nwith the SEO Content Template Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n4. Write Using Clear Language \n\nUse simple words and clear sentences in your content. To help both Google and users grasp your content more easily.\n\nConsider these examples:\n\nHard to Read ❌\n\n\t\n\nEasy to Read ✅\n\n\n\n\n“Utilize this tool to enhance your digital marketing strategy.”\n\n\t\n\n“Use this tool to improve your marketing.”\n\n\n\n\n“The implementation of this feature will significantly augment user experience.”\n\n\t\n\n“This feature will improve user experience.”\n\nHere are some tips for simplifying complex ideas: \n\nBreak long sentences into shorter ones\nUse common words instead of jargon\nFocus on clarity and brevity\n\nFurther reading: \n\n14 Tips for Writing Awesome Website Content\nBusiness Writing: Overview & Tips for How to Write Effectively\n5. Organize Your Information Under Relevant Headings \n\nHeadings help organize your content and improve readability. Which helps search engines (and users) better understand your content. \n\nSo, group related information under clear heading tags—HTML elements ranging from H1 to H6. To break down your content into scannable blocks.\n\nLike this:\n\nFollow these tips to use headings effectively:\n\nAlign your headings and subheadings with search intent\nMake sure each heading accurately reflects the content it introduces\nUse concise and descriptive headings \nMaintain a logical hierarchy—H1 for the main title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections, and so on\nInclude target keywords naturally within headings and subheadings when possible\n\nTo see whether you have any existing issues with your website’s H1 tags, use the Site Audit tool. \n\nLaunch the tool, enter your website, and click the “Create project” button.\n\nFollow the configuration instructions to set up your website audit.\n\nOnce you’re ready, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nYou’ll see a dashboard once the audit is complete. Which shows an overview of your site’s health.\n\nClick the “Issues” tab to see a list of problems found on your website. Categorized as “Errors,” “Warnings,” and “Notices.”\n\nApply the “Meta tags” filter to see issues related to H1 tags.\n\nClick “Why and how to fix it” next to the highlighted issue. To learn more about the issues and ways to fix it. \n\nAnd follow the tips to resolve the problem.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nCraft Your SEO Strategy with NLP in Mind\n\nUnderstanding NLP principles helps you create content that will likely perform better in search results.\n\nAnd Semrush's suite of SEO tools can help you.\n\nStart by creating your free Semrush account today.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
