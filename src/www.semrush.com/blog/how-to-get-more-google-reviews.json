  "content": "Google reviews can play a huge role in a brand’s success. Especially positive reviews.\n\nThat means it’s a good idea to think about how to get more Google reviews for your business.\n\nTo illustrate why, let’s go over some of the advantages.\n\nBenefits of Getting Google Reviews\n\nBy collecting Google reviews, you can:\n\nLearn what customers think about you. This includes what they like and dislike about your business. So you know what’s working and what to improve on.\nIncrease visibility. Having more good Google reviews can improve your business’s Google local pack rankings.\nPersuade people to buy. A product’s number of reviews is the second most influential factor affecting prospects’ perception of its quality and decision to buy it, according to research.\nHow to Get More Google Reviews: 9 Methods\n\nNow, here’s how to get more Google reviews.\n\nNote\n\nTrying to influence reviews through tactics like offering incentives, discouraging negative feedback, and buying or faking reviews violates Google’s policies. And can result in penalties.\n\n1. Optimize Your Google Business Profile\n\nSet up a Google Business Profile (GBP) for your business if it doesn’t yet have one. This is a free business listing that appears in places like Maps and Search.\n\nIt also stores your Google reviews, as this GBP from Diablo & Sons Saloon shows:\n\nGo to the profile creation tool and follow the steps for adding your business to Google. Which entails providing information like your business’s name, category, and website URL.\n\nIf a profile for your business already exists, claim it or follow Google’s steps to request ownership from the current owner.\n\nOnce you have control of your GBP, choose a verification method (email, text message, etc.).\n\nGoogle may take up to five business days to verify your profile. You can use it to collect Google reviews after that.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse Semrush’s Listing Management tool to automatically distribute your information to GBP and dozens of other directories all at once. You can also manage these listings within the tool.\n \n\nFurther reading: Google Business Profile Optimization: 5 Tips to Drive Business\n\nIncrease Your Local Visibility\n\nwith the Listing Management Tool\n\nGet Free Report →\n2. Provide an Excellent Experience\n\nIf you wow customers with amazing products, services, and customer support, they’ll likely leave you a Google review without hesitation.\n\nThis is the best way to get good Google reviews.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause people are more motivated to take action when they feel strongly about something. Like writing a glowing review to tell others about their phenomenal experience with your business.\n\n3. Share Your Google Review Link\n\nShare your Google review link everywhere users may see it. So they can easily leave you a review.\n\nThere are a few ways to get your Google review link through GBP. Alternatively, use Semrush’s free Google review link generator.\n\nLaunch the tool, type your business name into the search bar, and then use the drop-down menu to select your business.\n\nOnce you’ve selected your business, the tool will generate short and long Google review links for it. We recommend using the short link—it looks cleaner.\n\nCopy your Google review link. Then share it in places like your:\n\nWebsite footer\nEmail signature\nSocial media profiles\n\nFor example, Bunny & Co. has placed a Google review link in its website’s footer.\n\nCreate Your Google Review Link\n\nwith Semrush’s Free Link Generator\n\nUse It Now →\n4. Provide a Review QR Code\n\nPreparing a QR code customers can scan to access your Google review link is helpful when clicking a link isn’t convenient. Like when:\n\nThe customer is shopping in your physical store\nYou want to include your review link in your business cards or posters\n\nUse Semrush’s Google review link generator to generate a QR code for your review link.\n\nAfter creating your Google review link with the tool, enter your email address into the “Wait! There’s more…” section and click “Send me QR & prints.”\n\nThen, check your inbox for QR code assets you can use.\n\n5. Respond to Current Reviews\n\nResponding to your Google reviews signals that you take feedback seriously. Which can motivate prospects to leave reviews in the future after they become customers.\n\nPlus, research from Shout About Us reveals that up to 76% of customers may update their negative reviews if you reply and take steps to address their concerns.\n\nSo, respond by:\n\nThanking customers for their feedback—whether positive or negative\nSharing the follow-up actions you’ve taken in response to negative feedback\n\nSemrush’s Review Management tool makes it easy to monitor and respond to your Google reviews.\n\nOpen the tool and enter your business’s name, site, or phone number into the search bar. Then, select your business from the drop-down menu.\n\nClick the “Try it now” button on the page that loads.\n\nFollow the steps to sign up for Semrush Local. Once you’ve set up the tool, click the “Review Management” tab.\n\nScroll down the page to see your reviews. And click the “Not Replied” filter to view only those you haven’t responded to yet.\n\nThe tool will suggest AI-generated replies to your Google reviews. \n\nModify any reply as you see fit and click “Reply” to submit it.\n\nTake a page out of Giordano’s book if you can. The pizza chain replies to every Google review it gets—both good and bad.\n\nFurther reading: How to Respond to Negative Reviews: 6 Best Practices\n\nMonitor Your Online Reviews\n\nwith the Review Management Tool\n\nGet Free Report →\n6. Send a Feedback Email\n\nEmailing customers to ask for a Google review right after they buy from you is a good way to get reviews while their experiences are still fresh in their minds.\n\nHere’s an example of an email requesting a Google review from Love and Logic:\n\nImage Source: Milled\n\nYou can also use an email marketing platform to automate your customer feedback emails instead of sending them manually.\n\nFurther reading: How to Build an Engaging Ecommerce Email Marketing Strategy\n\n7. Design Physical Review Cards\n\nCreating physical cards asking for Google reviews works well if you interact with customers in offline situations like:\n\nRunning a brick-and-mortar shop—where you can place review cards at the checkout counter\nDelivering physical goods to customers—where you can include a feedback card in the package\n\nSome cards have QR codes for customers to scan, but you can also use cards embedded with near-field communication (NFC) technology.\n\nIf you do, customers just need to activate their phone’s NFC feature and tap it against the card to visit your Google review page.\n\nThis Instagram post from Zappycards shows how it works:\n\nThe result?\n\nLeaving a review becomes even more convenient.\n\n8. Ask for Reviews Directly\n\nTo get more good Google reviews if you’re engaging with customers in person, just ask.\n\nYou may even receive more reviews this way than waiting for customers to take action on their own.\n\nGood times to ask for a Google review include:\n\nAfter clearing the customer’s table (at a restaurant)\nAfter the customer has paid for their items\nJust before the customer leaves\n\nAnd here’s a sample script you can try:\n\n“Thanks for stopping by today! If you enjoyed your time with us, could you take a couple of minutes to leave us a Google review? Thank you so much!”\n\n9. Provide Review Instructions\n\nConsider teaching users how to leave you a Google review. If they need help, this could help you get more reviews than you might otherwise.\n\nDrs. Najem & Lehky Orthodontics does this by sharing step-by-step instructions with screenshots:\n\nAnd Rehab In Motion posted an Instagram video demonstrating how customers can leave it a Google review:\n\nMake the Most of Your Reviews\n\nAs you increase your reviews on Google, use tools like Listing Management and Review Management to keep up with them.\n\nYou can access these tools with Semrush Local.\n\nExplore the app today.\n\nManage Your Local Visibility\n\nwith Semrush Local\n\nSign Up Now →",
