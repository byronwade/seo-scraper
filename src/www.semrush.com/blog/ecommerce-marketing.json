  "content": "What Is Ecommerce Marketing? \n\nEcommerce marketing uses promotional tactics to attract new customers to your store, convert them into paying customers, and encourage them to return for future purchases to increase retention.\n\nEcommerce marketers use many channels to attract website visitors, including email and social media marketing, search engine optimization (SEO), and pay-per-click (PPC). \n\nFor example, a clothing store might promote a Fourth of July sale through an email campaign to its customer and subscriber lists. They could then retarget those audiences through Facebook Ads to improve conversion rates.\n\nA multichannel strategy allows ecommerce marketers to reach a wider audience and drive as much traffic as possible to their online stores. That creates a seamless customer experience across all paid and organic channels.\n\nEcommerce Marketing vs Ecommerce Advertising\n\nEcommerce advertising is a subset of ecommerce marketing. \n\nEcommerce marketing includes product promotion strategies and tactics\n\nEcommerce advertising refers to paid product promotion on digital advertising platforms. For example, display, banner, or rich media ads.\n\nEcommerce advertising is part of a holistic multichannel marketing strategy, which considers all aspects of the customer journey. \n\nThis approach aligns marketing channels like social media, email, SEO, and advertising to create a consistent and integrated experience. \n\nTypes of Ecommerce Marketing\n\nEcommerce marketing encompasses a wide range of channels like:\n\nEmail \nContent\nSEO\nSocial media\nPPC\nLocal\nEmail \n\nEmail is a tried-and-true ecommerce marketing tool. It drives an average ROI (return on investment) of $36 for every dollar spent. That’s higher than any other channel. \n\nMarketers use email marketing to promote products or services, connect with customers, motivate purchases, and encourage retention across the customer journey.\n\nFor example, & Other Stories, a fashion brand, uses email marketing to promote new styles, share inspiring stories to engage their subscribers, and offer exclusive deals and promotions. \n\nYou can set up a reliable campaign quickly with email service providers like Intercom, ActiveCampaign, and ConvertKit.\n\nContent Marketing\n\nMarketers use content marketing to attract and retain a specific audience by producing valuable and relevant content, establishing topical authority, and driving qualified leads to stores. \n\n“Content” can take the form of blog posts, white papers, case studies, videos, podcasts, downloadable templates, and more. \n\nGiven the many content types available, you need a concrete strategy for each one.\n\nOnce you have a content marketing strategy, tools like Semrush’s Topic Research tool, Keyword Gap Analysis, and On Page SEO Checker can help you find ideas, identify gaps with competitors, audit existing content, and track performance.\n\nLearn more about how marketers use content marketing strategies in our State of Content Marketing: 2023 Global Report.\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO)\n\nEcommerce SEO improves your site’s visibility and search engine rankings to drive sustainable organic traffic to your store. \n\nThat includes optimizing product pages, category pages, meta tags, building high-quality backlinks, and creating quality content.\n\nThe foundation of any SEO strategy is a solid understanding of which search terms—or keywords—your target audience is using to find the products you offer. \n\nFor example, suppose you sell artisanal teas, and someone in your area searches for “buy artisanal tea brands” on Google. In that case, if your store is optimized for the term, it may appear first in the SERP (search engine results page), increasing the likelihood of a user clicking through to your website and potentially making a purchase. \n\nUsing Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool, you can identify your target keywords and begin implementing SEO strategies that have long-term business benefits.\n\nSocial Media\n\nSocial media marketing uses platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn to promote a brand, product, or service, build customer relationships, and drive ecommerce site traffic or sales.\n\nSocial media marketing includes tactics like:\n\nCreating and sharing content\nCompetitor analysis\nFollower engagement\nPartnering with influencers \nAnalyzing metrics to improve performance\n\nSome ecommerce brands use social media marketing to promote their mission. Tentree, a clothing company, leans into its message through social media posts. \n\nAlthough this post doesn’t promote Tentree’s products, it highlights its eco-friendly mission, which can attract and engage its socially conscious target audience. \n\nSemrush’s Social Media Dashboard allows you to run competitor analysis, create and plan content, and track messages and performance through analytical insights. \n\nPay-Per-Click (PPC)\n\nAdvertisers who use this method pay each time a user clicks on one of their ads displayed on search engines or social media platforms.\n\nEcommerce businesses use PPC ads to drive traffic to their website while using PPC platforms to target specific customer demographics. \n\nGoogle Ads is one of the most popular PPC ad platforms. It enables ecommerce businesses to create paid search ads related to their products or services that appear on the SERPs.\n\nWhen people search for a keyword like “best microwave,” many sponsored text and shopping ads appear: \n\nTo gain the top paid search spot, businesses bid on specific keywords by setting the maximum amount they’re willing to pay any time someone clicks their ad. \n\nGoogle uses many factors to determine Ad Rank and placement in the SERPs, which you can read about here. \n\nShopping ads also showcase products directly in the SERPs using images, giving customers a glimpse of the product before they click on the ad.\n\nUse tools like Google for Retail to share product listings, connect with shoppers, and create PPC ads.\n\nWith a Merchant Center account, you can list your business on Google for free, get personalized insights, and boost sales. You can also link to ecommerce platforms like Shopify.\n\nFinally, goal-based Performance Max campaigns allow you to track and reach conversion goals.\n\nEach of these tools will help you succeed in ecommerce marketing.\n\nLocal\n\nEcommerce businesses can target a concentrated area by implementing local marketing tactics.\n\nFor example, a fashion retailer could use local marketing to promote a flash sale on winter coats to customers in colder regions. \n\nImage source\n\nThe North Face used weather-based targeting in their women's hiking ads, displaying different versions based on the weather conditions in the viewer's region. \n\nUsers in colder regions saw the pullover hoodie ad, while users in warmer regions saw the tank top ad.\n\nLocal ecommerce marketing uses strategies like website optimization, tools like Google Business Profile, local citations, backlinks, and positive reviews. \n\nGoogle's local search algorithm ranks the business's relevance, distance, and prominence in search results.\n\n26 Successful Ecommerce Strategies to Get You Results\n\nEcommerce marketing drives new and repeat customers through tailored campaigns that you can implement using appropriate tools. Regardless of the size of your business.\n\nHere are 25 ecommerce marketing strategies to help you, organized by type. \n\nEmail Marketing Strategies\n1. Nurture Email Leads\n\nDespite the rise of social media and other digital channels, email marketing still has the potential to increase a business’ bottom line significantly. \n\nDiana Carter, founder of Carter House Copy, saw a return of over $1,000 for a client from a single email campaign.\n\nImplementing intentional and strategic tactics can help businesses create email campaigns that engage and convert audiences. \n\nAlmost 60% of consumers say marketing emails influence their purchase decisions, so this platform has significant potential to drive ecommerce sales and grow your customer base. \n\nPlatforms like Mailchimp, Constant Contact, and Campaign Monitor provide you with tools to design, send, and track your campaigns. A CRM (customer relationship management) software platform like Salesforce, Pipedrive, or Hubspot can also help you manage customer data, track lead interactions, and create targeted email campaigns. \n\n2. Customize Your Email Campaigns\n\nEmail marketing campaigns encourage direct contact between your company and its clientele. Customized emails provide a more personal reach than social media.\n\nSeveral methods can help improve your odds and increase audience engagement, including:\n\nWelcome emails: Let new customers know the benefits of subscribing \nNewsletter emails: Adding a personalized touch with updates can improve website traffic\nThank you emails: Since customers are likely checking for emails from you after a purchase, this is an ideal way to promote offers\nPromotional emails and gifts: Show your customers what they could buy and sweeten the deal with a discount\nBirthday emails: Add a personal touch to any gift or special offer\nAbandoned cart emails: Send to customers who left items in their online shopping carts without completing their purchases\nReferral emails: Send to existing customers to encourage them to refer their friends or family in exchange for a reward or to join a customer loyalty program\nShopping cart drop-out emails: Remind customers what they could have while also adding information on related products and offers\n\nFor example, in this promotional email, Uncle Jack’s offered customers a “Christmas in July” discount for ugly Christmas sweaters:\n\nProviding personalized content and offers helps businesses foster relationships with current customers and drive online sales growth.\n\n3. Exercise caution with hypersegmentation\n\nSegmented email campaigns have a 100.95% higher click rate than non-segmented ones, making them the cream of the email marketing strategy. \n\nHypersegmentation takes it further by creating different campaigns for different segments. \n\nWhile hypersegmentation may result in even higher engagement metrics, such as click-through rates, it’s not right for every business. \n\nFor smaller audiences and teams, hypersegmentation may not be the best use of resources and may result in lower revenue. \n\nKasey Luck, Founder of Luck & Co, urges marketers to consider: \n\nyour audience size\nthe resources you’ll put into segmentation\n\nSmall businesses with limited resources should consider hypersegmentation’s ROI carefully. \n\nSuppose you have two marketers responsible for an email list of 20,000 people. Hypersegmenting every email campaign could mean you only reach a segment of 4–500 people. \n\nWhile you may achieve a 5–10% click-through rate, your total revenue from these campaigns may be lower than if you sent emails to a wider audience.\n\nInstead, smaller teams should focus on traditional email segmentation and put additional resources toward other marketing campaign goals.\n\n4. Capture more email subscribers with strategic pop-ups\n\nEmail pop-ups don’t capture visitors like other methods, but they can still work. \n\nOne study of 80,000 businesses found that pop-up forms had a 2-3 % conversion rate.\n\nSince some pop-ups intrude on the user experience, ecommerce marketers should try tactics like: \n\nDisplaying pop-ups at the end of a blog post: Works like a CTA, triggering when users finish reading the content\nOffering a pop-up when a user is about to exit: Triggers when someone is about to close or leave the browser tab. OptinMonster offers the Exit Intent feature\nIntroducing a request after a page scroll: As soon as someone scrolls down X% of a page, the subscribe box slides in from a corner\n\nAlways consider the user experience by limiting interruptions to browsing.\n\nSocial Media Marketing Strategies\n5. Add shopping profiles \n\nThe Influencer Marketing Factory found that 40% of people prefer online shopping, while only 13% prefer in-store shopping. \n\nWith more people using social media to discover and buy products, social media platforms are adding shopping features. \n\nTikTok recently introduced a feature allowing brands to add links to products in videos. Users can click on the link to buy the product without leaving the app, offering a frictionless purchase process. \n\nImage Source\n6. Lean into user-generated content (UGC)\n\nUGC is any content created by unpaid contributors or fans of a brand, product, or service. For example, when a person posts photos or videos on social media using your product and tags your brand.\n\nUGC can add social proof by showing how real people benefit from your products or services. Consumers are 2.4 times more likely to say UGC is authentic compared to brand-created content. \n\nThat can translate to more sales. \n\nModcloth, an online retailer, has a #MyModCloth section on its homepage featuring customers wearing and styling their items in real-life situations.\n\nModcloth incentivizes people to post outfits on their social profiles. \n\n7. Collaborate with influencers \n\nInfluencers on social media can help promote your products or services while using their following and credibility to reach new customers and increase brand awareness.\n\nYou pay them to promote products through incentives like free products, lifetime discounts, and fees. \n\nHubspot found that 1 in 4 marketers currently use influencer marketing, with 72% of Gen Z and Millennials following them on social media. \n\nHere’s an example of a sponsored post on Instagram:\n\nAnd with more in-app shopping features on popular channels like Instagram and TikTok, users can buy directly from the app, simplifying the purchase process and encouraging them to stay on your profile.\n\n8. Host live and virtual events \n\nLive and virtual events offer a more personal and interactive experience, allowing businesses to connect with their customers in new ways.\n\nYou can use them to:\n\nShowcase new products or features\nDemonstrate how products work\nCollaborate with influencers\nAnswer customer questions in real time\n\nLive and virtual events also create a sense of exclusivity and community among customers, which helps build loyalty to your brand.\n\nImage Source\nContent Marketing Strategies\n9. Use video marketing\n\nVideo marketing is an engaging and memorable way for audiences to connect to your brand and better understand your product offerings. You can also use video marketing for PPC campaigns. \n\nGoogle found relevant video ads get three times more attention than generic ones. \n\nConsider using video marketing to teach about your product or services. Because 7 in 10 people feel empowered, motivated, or confident after learning something new from a Youtube video.\n\nFor example, Nespresso made this video to market its new Pixie coffee machine: \n\nVideo marketing helps establish your brand as an expert, so you can become the leading authority in your ecommerce industry. \n\n10. Collaborate with guest bloggers\n\nPartnering with guest bloggers drives traffic to your website and can further establish your brand as an authority in your ecommerce industry. \n\nIt works like this: \n\nFirst, find bloggers with an audience interested in your niche or products through Google searches or social media platforms.\n\nThen, reach out to them with a pitch for a guest post. For example, a formalwear brand could feature a blog about Kentucky Derby fashion in the beginning of May.\n\nYou can flesh out details like topic, deadline, and compensation. Then provide the blogger with your brand’s editorial guidelines and tone of voice. \n\nAlso, allow them to include a link to their website or social media profile in their author bio. \n\nOnce the post goes up, promote it on your social media channels and newsletter to increase visibility. \n\nThen rinse and repeat to keep your blog fresh and attract new readers.\n\nCollaborating with guest bloggers also gives valuable backlinks to your website. Backlinks from authoritative pages are a vote of confidence, signaling to search engines that you have valuable content. They’re also a ranking factor. \n\nTools like Semrush’s Backlink Analytics can help you evaluate and compare link profiles between you and your competitors. \n\nCart Recovery Strategies\n11. Prevent Out-of-Stock Inventory \n\nOut-of-stock inventory can lead to lost sales and unhappy customers. \n\nAccording to data from Statista, 58% of online shoppers in the United States felt that out-of-stock issues impacted their shopping behaviors. \n\nOne way to prevent out-of-stock inventory is to use inventory management software like ShipBob or Zoho. They help businesses track inventory levels in real time. This way, you can identify when your products run low and reorder them before they run out of stock. \n\nAnother strategy is to use an app like Back in Stock for Shopify. These apps notify customers when out-of-stock products become available. \n\n12. Abandoned Cart Messaging\n\nCommon advice is to send your first message within 30 minutes of the cart abandonment. \n\nBut James Laurain, Head of Growth at Aampe Marketing, researched the probability of purchase and found that sending a message pointing to a specific item (blue dotted line) was more effective than most other strategies. \n\nHe also found that abandoned cart messages converted a full 3.5 days after customers viewed a product by optimizing the timing and messaging. \n\nThe key is finding out when someone is most likely to respond, which requires testing and refining your messaging strategies over time.\n\nPay-Per-Click Strategies\n13. Run PPC campaigns\n\nA survey conducted by the Out of Home Advertising Association of America (OAAA) found that the primary action taken by internet users after seeing an ad was looking for information on a search engine.\n\nImage Source \n\nThat gives marketers an opportunity to optimize their digital marketing campaigns with targeted search engine ads. \n\nPPC ads enable you to customize the ad's message and the audience. By targeting specific demographics and interests to ensure you show your ads to the right people at the right time.\n\nFor example, a luxury watch business can create a PPC campaign targeting individuals interested in high-end timepieces who recently searched for related keywords or visited similar websites. \n\nUsing targeting options like geographic location, age, gender, and even device type, the business can ensure its ads display to the right people at the right time. \n\n14. Retarget your customers\n\nRetargeting involves showing ads to people who have already interacted with your business. \n\nThe idea is these customers are more likely to buy because they’re familiar with your brand and products. \n\nUse social media platform ads on Facebook and Instagram to target audiences based on their interests, behaviors, and demographics. \n\nImage Source\n\nBusinesses can also retarget through Google Ads and other search engines. By targeting users who previously searched for relevant keywords or visited specific pages on the website, they have a better chance of converting these potential customers.\n\nWebsite Optimization Strategies\n15. Show inventory on your product pages\n\nOne way to create urgency and provide useful information to your customers is to display an item’s stock levels if they are in high demand or close to selling out. \n\nThis tactic can also combat cart abandonment by creating a sense of scarcity and prompting customers to make a quick decision. \n\nJ Crew displays stock levels when products are close to selling out. \n\nThis feature isn’t distracting. What’s more, it provides extra motivation for customers to complete the purchase.\n\nImage Source \n\nYou can also use this tactic on your cart page as a final nudge to customers. \n\n16. Use chatbots for sale promotion\n\nUsing chatbots and live chat makes your product more personalized and engaging. Tidio found that 62% of consumers would rather talk to a chatbot than a human agent. \n\nMost chatbot services can store general information about users, like their names and email addresses. That can help your ecommerce storeretarget customers. \n\nImage Source\n\nIntegrating chatbots into your support strategy can enhance customer satisfaction and improve your marketing efforts.\n\n17. Show your customers other interested users\n\nScarcity drives demand. \n\nDemonstrating how many other users are interested in the same product can influence customer perception of the product’s value. \n\nIt also creates a sense of urgency to drive them toward a purchase.\n\nClothing brand Madewell displays how many people added the item to their bag in the last seven days, which helps add value to the product and motivates buyers.\n\n18. Write product descriptions from the customer’s point of view\n\nSuccessful product descriptions speak to the customer’s needs, pain points, and concerns. \n\nWhen writing descriptions, focus on your product’s benefits and how it can motivate a change in customer behavior. \n\nGlossier balances its product descriptions by providing detailed information while also speaking the language of its customers.\n\nRead reviews of your products to see how customers talk about them. If common questions occur in the comments, address them in the description. \n\n19. Feature similar products \n\nOffering your customers alternative products to the one they’re viewing can encourage them to continue interacting and engaging with your ecommerce website. \n\nThat’s preferable to them seeking out competitors for comparison shopping.\n\nThe Good, a conversion rate optimization company, calls this “The Etsy Test.” Etsy displays similar products above the fold of the product a customer is viewing.\n\nNotice how they add the number of items left in the cart to demonstrate additional scarcity.\n\nThis tactic is especially effective for brands that run Google Shopping ads because people who land on a site from a Google listing may be comparison shopping. \n\nAdding a “Similar Items” section encourages shoppers to stay on your site even if the product they found isn’t quite right for their needs.\n\n20. Cross-sell or upsell\n\nShowing complementary products or add-ons is a great way to keep shoppers returning.\n\nThe probability of selling a product to an existing customer is 60–70%, while the probability of selling to a new customer is 5–20%. \n\nAlso, cross-selling accounts for 35% of Amazon’s revenue, showing it’s a highly effective sales technique. \n\nYou can cross-sell and upsell at three key points in the sales funnel:\n\nBefore purchase: Add cross-sells and upsells on the product page before customers add an item to their cart\nDuring purchase: Add cross-sells and upsells during checkout or when customers view their cart\nAfter purchase: Send cross-sells and upsells through email, SMS, or when a customer returns to your store after a purchase\n\nOne strategy is to offer product bundles that expose customers to new products. By grouping smaller, complementary products, shoppers may be willing to pay more because they also receive more. \n\nMadewell adds a “You Might Also Love” section to its product pages to show items that complement one another (like an outfit) and encourage bundling. \n\nSEO Strategies\n21. Optimize page titles and meta descriptions\n\nThe page title and meta description are usually the first elements users see when they search for a keyword. They may determine whether or not users click or skip your page. \n\nWe recommend following these recommendations: \n\nKeep your page title between 30–60 characters so people can see the full title\nKeep your meta description to 160 characters or fewer\nInclude your target keyword in the title\nUse search intent to find the top-ranking titles and write your title based on these\nCommunicate what readers will learn on your page\n\nIn this example, Outbrain uses a clear SEO title and meta description that shows readers what they’ll learn if they click on the article. \n\nTools like Semrush’s Topic Research tool help you look up successful headlines that searchers click on related to your topic. \n\nRead more about how to write effective meta descriptions to get people to click on your page. \n\n22. Use internal and external links\n\nInternal and external links can improve the SEO performance of your website. \n\nInternal linking helps establish a page hierarchy on your website, indicating which pages are most important and relevant to search engines.\n\nFor example, hyperlinking text to a blog post helps your audience find related content and encourages them to stay on your site.\n\nExternal links lead readers to high-quality, authoritative content on another website. When you add external links, make sure the links open in another tab so people can explore without losing their place in your content.\n\nRead more about how to build an effective internal linking strategy and some of our best external linking practices.\n\n23. Conduct regular site-wide audits\n\nAudits can uncover overlooked issues like broken links, orphaned pages, or slow load times so you can address them without harming the user experience. \n\nSemrush’s Site Audit Tool lets you conduct comprehensive site audits quickly, identifying and addressing any issues impacting your website's performance.\n\nFirst, create a project and set up the audit. This article will guide you through the steps.\n\nOnce the audit is complete, you’ll see issues divided into three categories: Errors, Warnings, and Notices. That will help you prioritize your fixes.\n\nSemrush breaks out the problems by type, like crawlability, on-page SEO, or overall site performance. Some are easy to fix, while others are more complex. \n\nLuckily, Semrush offers an explanation and “how to” guide for each problem. Just click “Why and how to fix it” next to the issue name. \n\nLearn more about how to conduct comprehensive SEO audits on your site.\n\n24. Match search intent with your content\n\nIf you want users to find your content, it has to provide the exact information they want.\n\nFor example, someone searching for \"how to choose the right running shoes\" wants to learn more about different types of running shoes.\n\nSomeone searching for “nike pegasus running shoes” is looking to buy. \n\nHere are some tips to help you match search intent with your content:\n\nAnalyze search results: Look at the type of content that ranks well for the keyword you want to target and identify patterns in content format, word count, and style\nUse keywords strategically: Use the target keywords in your content, including in the title, headings, and body of the text. Avoid keyword stuffing, which can harm relevancy and the reader experience.\nCreate comprehensive content: Use images, videos, and other media to enhance the user's experience and provide more value\nOptimize for readability: Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings to break up the text so it’s scannable\nFocus on user experience: Make sure it loads quickly, is mobile-friendly, and has a clear call to action\nMonitor and update: Track your content's performance in search results and update as needed. Keep an eye on changes in search algorithms through tools like Semrush’s Organic Keyword Analytics tool or Google Analytics and adjust your content strategy accordingly.\n\nUnderstanding search intent helps you create relevant and useful content that meets the needs of your target audience.\n\n25. Incorporate the primary keyword in your URL\n\nHaving a clean URL structure can help search engines understand your webpage and provide you with a more user-friendly appearance in the SERPs.\n\nEffective URLs should: \n\nUse primary keywords: For example, if your primary keyword is “rollerblading gear,” you’ll want the URL to incorporate it, like example.com/rollerblading-gear\nBe legible: Separate the URL with hyphens (-) so it’s easy to read and people know what it’s about\nUse 60 characters or less: Although it’s a myth that Google prefers shorter URLs, it’s best to keep your URLs short for readability\n\nRead more about how to structure URLs in our guide.\n\n26. Study the competition\n\nAnalyzing your competitors’ websites can provide valuable insights into their strategies and highlight areas they may need to improve.\n\nYou can use the Market Explorer tool to track your main competitors and the Keyword Gap analyzer to compare organic keywords to your competitors. \n\nOur Traffic Analytics tool shows how much traffic your competitors receive, along with major sources and channels (e.g., paid, social, etc). \n\nRead more about how to perform an SEO competitor analysis and gain valuable insights to improve your website’s SEO strategy.\n\nStart Ecommerce Marketing Today\n\nEcommerce marketing allows you to drive traffic, sell more, and retain customers.
