  "content": "What Is an SEO Score? \n\nAn SEO score is a metric that shows a website’s overall technical SEO health. And indicates how well it may perform in organic search engine rankings. \n\nThe exact meaning of the metric may differ between various SEO tools.\n\nFor example, Semrush's Site Health is an SEO scoring metric. And it’s shown here in the Site Audit tool. \n\nA high Site Health score means your site is well-optimized for search engines and people. \n\nThe more technical issues and problems you have within your site, the lower your SEO score will be.\n\nHow to Check Your SEO Score\n\nTo check your website's SEO score, run a technical SEO audit with Semrush's Site Audit tool. \n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\nOpen the tool and create your first project by entering the domain and project name.\n\nNext, configure your project (follow the steps in this article if you need help). And note that you can crawl up to 100 pages with a free Semrush account.\n\nThen, click the “Start Site Audit” button. And the tool will crawl your site similar to the way Google does to analyze any potential technical SEO issues.\n\nOnce the crawl is complete, Site Audit provides a detailed overview of your site's health.\n\nIt’ll look like this:\n\nThe “Site Health” section gives you two important pieces of information:\n\nYour Site Health score: Based on the number and variety of errors and warnings found on your site\nThe average score among top performers: Based on the top 10% of the websites in your industry\n\nNow, let's take a look at what affects your site’s SEO score and how to improve it.\n\nCheck Your SEO Score\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nHow to Improve Your SEO Score \n\nYou need to address technical and on-page issues to improve your SEO score.\n\nSee your site's issues by clicking the “Issues” tab in the Site Audit tool. \n\nThe problems shown here are ranked by severity:\n\nErrors: High-severity issues\nWarnings: Medium-severity issues\nNotices: Not necessarily issues (But it's good to go through them and see what you can improve)\n\nEach line will include a link to a list of URLs affected by that particular issue. Plus an explanation of the issue and tips on how to tackle it when you click on “Why and how to fix it.”\n\nLike this:\n\nNow, let’s go over some of the main ways you can improve your score that you’re likely to see in the tool: \n\nMake Sure Google Can Crawl and Index Your Website\n\nSearch engines have to be able to crawl (find pages) and index (store those pages in a database) your website for it to rank. So your score is influenced by how well search engine bots can do those things.\n\nGooglebot follows a three-step process:\n\nIt discovers a webpage through a link on other webpage (on your site or another site)\nIt analyzes all of the content on the page (copy, text, images, videos, etc.) and stores the page in Google’s index—so long as there are no issues that prevent indexing\nIf can serves your page to users in search engine results when relevant to users' search queries\n\nSome issues make it harder for Google to complete this process. And problems can occur at any stage.\n\nIf your website has issues related to crawling or indexing, your score will be negatively impacted.\n\nHere are a few ways to ensure your site is easy to crawl and index:\n\nFurther reading: Crawlability & Indexability: What They Are & How They Affect SEO\n\nImplement a Solid Website Structure\n\nYour site’s architecture influences how easy it is for both humans and search engines to navigate it. \n\nA solid site architecture can also help Googlebot find your most important pages. And understand how your pages are related. \n\nSite architecture includes things like:\n\nURL structure: How the various parts of webpage URLs (e.g. top-level domain, subdomain, path, parameters, etc.) are organized\nInternal links: Links to your pages from other pages of your website, and the anchor text (the clickable, linked tet) of those links\nNavigation: Clicking through your website to find various pages or resources. Which is primarily influenced by your website’s navigation menu.\n\nA disorganized website architecture may lower your SEO score. And might look something like this:\n\nBut a good website architecture will:\n\nOrganize pages logically. The most important pages should be at the top of your website hierarchy (i.e., linked from your homepage). \nLink pages that are topically relevant. And with anchor text that communicates the content of the destination page.\nLimit crawl depth. No pages are more than three to four clicks from the homepage to help both Google and users find them\n\nOne good way of organizing your website is with a flat architecture. Which looks like this:\n\nSite architecture becomes more important (and more influential for your SEO score) as you publish more pages. \n\nSubmit Your Sitemap to Google\n\nAn XML sitemap is a file that tells Googlebot which pages on your website to crawl and index. To help Google crawl your website more efficiently. \n\nSome content management systems like WordPress and Shopify will automatically generate sitemaps. If your website has one, it will likely be located at “yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml.” \n\nIf not, you can use a sitemap generator tool to create one. And then add it to your root directory.\n\nThen, submit your sitemap to Google in your Google Search Console account. Click “Sitemaps” under “Indexing.”\n\nEnter your sitemap URL, then click “Submit.”\n\nLook for the message “Success” under the status column to confirm your sitemap was successfully submitted.\n\nImprove Your Internal Linking\n\nInternal links send Googlebot around your website to find your pages. So, resolving linking issues and optimizing links can make your website easier to crawl. \n\nWe recommend that you do the following:\n\nRepair broken links (i.e., links that don’t work or lead to dead pages)\nAdd links to orphan pages (i.e., pages that aren’t linked to from any other page on the site))\nUse descriptive anchor text \nAvoid using the rel=\"nofollow\" attribute (which tells Googlebot not to follow a link)\nFix Duplicate Content\n\nDuplicate content occurs when the same content (or highly similar content) appears on more than one web page. It confuses Google about which version to rank—and could lead to lower or no rankings.\n\nYou have two options for resolving duplicate content. \n\nDelete the unnecessary pages (after adding any needed content to the main one) and use a 301 redirect to point search engines to the version you want to prioritize\nAdd canonical tags to all duplicates to help Googlebot understand which version of the page you want to be indexed (you should do this when duplicates are necessary)\nPrioritize Website Security\n\nRunning your website with hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a must for SEO. It’s a confirmed ranking factor because Google only wants to send users to secure websites.\n\nHTTPS pages are displayed like this in a web browser:\n\nTo serve your pages on HTTPS, you need an up-to-date security certificate—a digital file issued by a third party that confirms your website’s identity and data encryption.\n\nFurther reading: HTTP vs. HTTPS: Differences, Benefits, and Migration Tips \n\nOffer a Good User Experience\n\nYour site needs to provide a good user experience by having pages that load fast, that don’t shift unexpectedly, etc. Because Google prefers to rank webpages that provide a great page experience (which they’ve confirmed is a ranking factor). \n\nAnd Googlebot prioritizes indexing the mobile versions of pages. So your website needs to be optimized for mobile.\n\nIn Site Audit, your SEO score is influenced by two sets of usability metrics:\n\nCore Web Vitals: Google’s metrics that measure real-world user experience for load times, interactivity, and visual stability. Google uses the Core Web Vitals to evaluate a page’s overall experience\nSite performance: Speed-related factors. Like those related to webpage size, JavaScript, CSS, and other HTML elements.\n\nImproving usability often requires working on the backend of your website. Which may require the assistance of a web developer. \n\nBut it’s essential for providing a high-quality page experience.\n\nFurther reading: The Complete Guide to Mobile SEO—8 Tips & Best Practices\n\nImprove Page Load Speed\n\nTo improve your website’s Site Performance score, follow these steps.\n\nCompress Images\n\nImage compression is the process of reducing your images’ file sizes. So your website loads faster.\n\nTo compress an image, you can:\n\nResize your image using a photo editing tool\nUse an image compressor tool\nAdd an image optimizer plugin\nMinify JavaScript and CSS Files\n\nJavaScript and CSS files can make your website more visually engaging and interactive. But these files can often slow down load times.\n\nCompressing them can maintain their functionality while improving speed.\n\nYou can do this manually, but it’s best to use minifying tools.\n\nUse a CDN\n\nA content delivery network (CDN) is a group of servers that serves content to users based on location. So, using a CDN can improve load times across your website.\n\nSome of the most popular CDN providers are:\n\nCloudflare\nAmazon CloudFront\nGoogle Cloud CDN\nMicrosoft Azure\n\nCDN providers offer various pricing plans, like a flat monthly fee or usage-based pricing. The best option for your website will depend on your use and performance needs.\n\nStep Up Your On-Page Efforts\n\nOn-page SEO involves making improvements to your pages to help them rank better.\n\nYou can optimize these on-page elements directly in your CMS or by using a plugin to boost your SEO score.\n\nWrite Good Title Tags\n\nA title tag is an HTML element that indicates a page’s title. And Google often displays the title tag as the blue, clickable hyperlink in search results.\n\nEach of your pages should have a unique, concise title tag that includes your target keyword and is fewer than 60 characters. It should also entice users to click on your content.\n\nOptimize Your Meta Descriptions\n\nA meta description is HTML that provides a short summary of your webpage content. And Google will often display the meta description beneath the title shown in search results. \n\nEach page should have a unique and relevant meta description that’s 105 characters or fewer. \n\nYou can also add enticing offers or information to make your result more click-worthy.\n\nCraft Helpful URLs\n\nA URL is the web address for an individual page. Which communicates to users and search engines where to find a page, what it's about, and how your website is organized.\n\nYour URLs should: \n\nUse the HTTPS protocol\nUse logical subfolders \nHave concise and descriptive URL slugs\nUse Alt Text\n\nAlt text provides a description of an image for the visually impaired and to search engine crawlers. To make your website more accessible and help your images rank in search results.\n\nBut not all of your images need alt text. Only those that provide additional meaning or context about a topic.\n\nWhen writing alt text, make sure you’re descriptive and concise. And include your target keywords (or variations) when appropriate.\n\nImplement Structured Data\n\nStructured data (also called schema markup) is a standardized data vocabulary that helps search engines better understand your site’s content. And if a webpage includes schema markup, Google can extract the data and display it as a rich snippet.\n\nRich snippets are non-standard results that stand out in search.\n\nFor example, this webpage uses product schema to display key information about their product. Like an image, price, and star rating.\n\nGoogle supports rich results for 35 schema markup types. Some of the most common include:\n\nProduct\nEvent\nFAQ\nLocal business\nOrganization\nRecipe\nSitelinks\n\nIf you have content that qualifies for rich snippets, add the appropriate schema markup. Because it can lead to:\n\nImproved click-through rate (CTR)\nBetter meeting the user’s search intent (the reason behind the query)\nBetter optimization for voice search\n\nTo add a schema, use Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper. \n\nHow to Measure Your SEO Score Progress\n\nAfter you fix issues and take steps to optimize your website, rerun Site Audit to see your new results. \n\nSimply click the “Rerun campaign” button in the top right corner of the dashboard. \n\nAnd after you’ve run more than one audit, you'll be able to view historical results to track your progress over time.\n\nTo do this, click the “Progress” tab and select the desired time period and metric(s)—including Site Health.\n\nLike this:\n\nOther SEO Score Metrics\n\nNo single metric can tell you where you stand in all aspects of search engine optimization. So, here are some additional SEO metrics you can use to see how your site is performing:\n\nAuthority Score\n\nAuthority Score measures a domain’s overall reputability based on the quality and quantity of the backlinks, organic traffic, and presence of spam factors. And is presented on a scale out of 100.\n\nYou can easily check your Authority Score with Semrush's Domain Overview tool.\n\nEnter your domain, and click “Search.”\n\nYou’ll see your site’s Authority Score in the main “Overview” tab. \n\nTo get the most out of this metric, compare your Authority Score to your competitors’ scores. \n\nDo this by visiting the “Compare domains” tab. And entering up to four competitors’ domains.\n\nYou’ll see every domain’s Authority Score and other useful metrics. \n\nTip\n\nTo improve your Authority Score, build quality backlinks to your website. We recommend starting with the Backlink Gap tool, which helps you find backlink opportunities by analyzing competitors’ backlink profiles.\n\nGet Your and Your Competitors' Authority Scores\n\nwith the Domain Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nOn-Page SEO Score \n\nIf you want to look at the overall quality of a single page, use Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant to analyze the text on a page and score it on a scale from 1 to 10. \n\nJust open the tool, select “Import text from web,” add the page’s URL, and click “Import.” \n\nYou’ll see the page’s on-page SEO score in the widget on the right.\n\nIt analyzes your text in four categories:\n\nReadability\nSEO\nTone of voice\nOriginality \n\nFor an analysis of your most important pages, use the On Page SEO Checker.\n\nEnter your domain and click “Get ideas.” \n\nOnce you’ve configured and run the tool, you'll get an overview of all the ideas categorized by topic.\n\nLike this:\n\nClick on the “Optimization Ideas” tab to see a list of all the URLs that could use some on-page SEO optimization. Sorted by priority. \n\nTo see the ideas for a specific URL, click the blue button with the number of ideas:\n\nYou’ll then see a list of ideas for that specific page. Sorted by category. \n\nYou can learn more about each suggestion by hovering over “Why should I do this?” in the right column of the table. \n\nHere:\n\nBy implementing the ideas the tool provides, you can improve your chances of ranking your most important pages.\n\nImprove Your SEO Score\n\nwith the On Page SEO Checker\n\nSign up Now →\nFAQs\nWhy Is SEO Score Important?\n\nChecking your web SEO score gives you a comprehensive overview of your website's overall technical health.
