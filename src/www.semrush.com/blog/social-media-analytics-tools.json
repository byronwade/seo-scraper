Including audience behavior and preferences. \n\nFor example, Semrush’s Social Analytics tool tells you when your audience is likely to be online. Helping you drive more engagement. \n\nIt also provides demographic insights. Like audience age and gender. \n\nPro tip\n\nLearn social media fundamentals in our free Social Media Marketing Crash Course. Including how to track competitor insights, develop audience insights, and more. \n\nWhy Use Social Media Analytics Tools?\nTrack Performance Metrics\n\nTracking performance metrics can help you understand which content and campaigns resonate with your audience. And why. \n\nSocial analytics tools track a variety of different metrics. \n\nFollowers: How many people follow you on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and more\nReach: How many unique users have seen your content\nImpressions: How many times users view your content\nTotal engagements: How many times people interacted with your content. Including clicks, likes, comments, shares, saves, or bookmarks.\nEngagement rate: How much engagement your content received relative to how many times it was seen \n\nTracking these metrics is crucial to determining whether you’re meeting your social marketing goals. And whether you’re seeing a positive return on investment (ROI). Or return on ad spend (ROAS).\n\nFurther reading: 18 Social Media KPIs (and How to Track Them)\n\nSave Time \n\nSocial media analytics tools can help you save time. And streamline your workflows. \n\nAlong with built-in data analytics features, social analytics tools consolidate performance metrics into a single user interface. \n\nThis way, you don’t have to sign in to multiple platforms to analyze performance. Or compile reports.\n\nMake Data-Driven Marketing Decisions\n\nMany social media analytic tools use AI to identify patterns in your data. And offer recommendations to optimize your posts’ performance. \n\nIncluding the best times to post. And which media types or formats get the most engagement.\n\nThis can help you make better decisions about resource allocation. And choose which social media channels to prioritize in your content marketing strategy. \n\nFor example, if Pinterest drives more traffic to your site than Instagram with the same budget, you might double down on Pinterest content.\n\nChoosing the Right Social Media Analytics Tool\n\nBefore choosing your social media analytics tool, thoroughly research and compare features and limitations. \n\nTake advantage of free trials to test and compare tools before you buy.\n\nGoals\n\nEnsure the tool supports your goals. For example, if your biggest following is on Instagram, ensure it works with that platform. \n\nAsk yourself:\n\nDoes it support the specific channels you want to monitor?\nDoes it have the reporting capabilities you need?\nDoes it integrate with the other software and apps you use?\nWhich processes can it help you automate?\nDoes it track the specific key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics you want to measure? Like reach, engagement rate, and conversions. \nBudget\n\nSome analytic tools are designed to support solopreneurs, freelancers, and small teams. And will have affordable pricing. \n\nOthers are designed for large teams and enterprises—and come with a price tag to match. Compare a few tools to ensure you find the right one for your needs and budget. \n\nCompare each tool’s price and features\nConsider plan usage limits\nDecide how many users you need and select an appropriate plan \nLook for hidden costs and cancellation fees\nCheck whether billing is monthly or annual. Consider annual pricing, as this drops the price for many tools.\nUse free trials and discounts\n\nNote\n\nMany pricing pages have a drop-down you can select to see all features available across multiple plans. Use this function to compare capabilities and account limitations. \n \n\nUser-Friendliness\n\nDon’t waste time dealing with complicated tools or dashboards. The best social media analytics tools automatically transform your data into intuitive visualizations. For strategic insights at a glance. \n\nWhat to look for:\n\nIntuitive and user-friendly user interface (UI)\nCustomer onboarding resources like how-to guides\nCustomer support availability and quality\nDetailed and well-written product documentation \nAbility to add custom branding \nAutomated reporting \n\nPro tip\n\nLearn how to understand your target audience on social media and build long-term relationships in our free course: Building a Social Listening Program. \n\n10 Best Social Media Analytics Tools in 2024\n\nWhile most major social media platforms have their own native analytics feature, third-party analytics tools let you track and manage all (or most of) your social media channels in one place. \n\nBelow, we’ve listed 10 of the best.\n\n1.
