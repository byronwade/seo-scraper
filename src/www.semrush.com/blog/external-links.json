  "content": "What Is an External Link? \n\nAn external link, also known as an outbound link, is a hyperlink on a website that points to a different domain. They help search engines and users understand the topic and niche of a site, and provide additional value and resources.\n\nExternal links can also boost the ranking and reputation of a site if they come from authoritative and relevant sources.\n\nTip: You can quickly see how many external links point to your site by running it through Backlink Analytics. \n\nInternal vs. External Links\n\nInternal links are the opposite of external links. They’re hyperlinks that point to another page on the same website. \n\nThis is what an internal link looks like on our blog:\n\nBut leveraging both types of links is important for your own SEO.\n\nUsing external links helps:\n\nShow Google how your content relates to other pages\nProvide value to your readers by offering more information and resources\nBuild relationships with other sites, which can lead to exposure, traffic, and backlinks\n\nUsing internal links helps:\n\nImprove the user experience and navigation on your site \nSpread link equity (ranking power) among your pages\nBoost the relevance and authority of your pages for specific keywords\n\nFurther reading:\n\nHow to Build Your Website Architecture for SEO\nAre External Links Good for SEO? \n\nUsing external links (or outbound links) on your site can help your SEO in two big ways:\n\nFirst, they provide value to users—which improves the user experience. And a better UX can contribute to better rankings in various ways. \n\nSecond, they help the receiving domain’s SEO because Google and other major search engines see them as votes of confidence in the linked webpage.\n\nAnd each vote suggests the content on that page is credible, valuable, and useful.\n\nWhich means:\n\nPages with lots of external links pointing to them (also called backlinks) from authoritative sites tend to rank higher in search results. \n\nNofollow vs. ‘Follow’ External Links\n\nNofollow external links are hyperlinks that tell Google not to pass any ranking signals to the linked page.\n\nIn other words, you don’t “endorse” the page you’re linking to. \n\nYou can add a nofollow attribute to any external hyperlink by adding rel=“nofollow” to the HTML code.\n\nLike this:\n\n<a href=\"https://example.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Example</a>\n\n“Follow” external links, on the other hand, are hyperlinks that do tell Google to pass ranking signals to the linked page.\n\nYou don’t need to add any attribute to make an external link a “follow” link. It’s the default option.\n\nLike this:\n\n<a href=\"https://example.com\">Example</a>\n\nBut why would you want to use nofollow instead of follow external links?\n\nWell, there are some situations when using it can make a big difference for your SEO.\n\nYou should use the nofollow attribute when you don’t want to recommend or associate your site with the linked page.\n\nFor example, maybe you want to link to a competitor’s page for context, but you don’t want to pass any authority. \n\nOr, perhaps you want to flag a link as being sponsored or affiliated. \n\nJust know that Google treats the nofollow attribute as a hint, not a directive. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nNofollow Links vs. ‘Follow’: Everything You Need to Know\nWhat Are the Different Rel Attributes for External Links?\nExternal Links: SEO Best Practices\nLink to Relevant Sources\n\nIt’s good to have external links. But don’t just throw them in for the sake of it. Make sure they add value to your content and your readers.\n\nGood external links point to related content that supports your main points and provide context. \n\nFor example, you can link to statistics, research, infographics, or videos that back up your claims or provide more information.\n\nLike this:\n\nGoogle wants to show the most relevant results for any query. \n\nWhen you link to websites in the same niche as yours, both Google and users can better understand your content. \n\nLink to Authoritative Sources \n\nThe quality of your external links matters. A lot. \n\nOnly link to websites that are credible and professional. If you link to websites that have clickbait content or low-quality information, you’ll lose the trust of your readers and Google. Which hurts your reputation and your SEO.\n\nFor example, our State of Content Marketing report has lots of external links to reputable sources in the industry. \n\nLike this:\n\nIf you have to link to websites you don’t trust, use the nofollow attribute. \n\nOptimize Anchor Text\n\nAnchor text is the clickable text that indicates a hyperlink. \n\nIt helps users and Google understand what the external site or page is about. Which can enhance the user experience. And influence how the page ranks. \n\nSo, optimizing your anchor text is super important for SEO.\n\nSome tips to ensure your anchor text is SEO-friendly include:\n\nUsing relevant, descriptive text (as opposed to generic or off-topic text)\nBeing concise (stick to short, descriptive text)\nFormatting links so they’re easy to spot (clearly distinguishable between regular text)\n\nFor example, in the image below, the anchor text “disavow file” tells readers and Google the page that follows is about “disavow file.”\n\nOn the other hand, generic anchor text like “here” is unclear and gives no context.\n\nYou can find and fix anchor text issues on your site by crawling it with our Site Audit tool. \n\nFirst, add your domain name and then click “Start Audit.” \n\nThen, configure your settings based on the number of pages you want crawled and a number of other factors. \n\nAnd click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nWhen the audit is finished, head to the “Issues” tab and type “anchor” into the search bar. \n\nYou’ll see a list of your site’s anchor text issues. \n\nClick on the “Why and how to fix it” link beside each issue to learn more about it. And get tips on how to fix it. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhat Is Anchor Text? Best Practices for Optimizing Link Text\nAvoid Link Schemes\n\nLink schemes are sneaky ways of trying to use links to game Google rankings. \n\nIf Google catches you doing anything against their spam policies, you can get slapped with a penalty.\n\nWhich means your site may rank lower. Or not appear in search results at all. \n\nCommon link scheme activities include:\n\nBuying or selling links for ranking purposes\nExchanging goods or services for links\nUsing automated programs to create links on your site\nLinking from low-quality directories or bookmark sites\n\nStay away from all of the above. \n\nAnd remember, sponsored or affiliate links should have the rel=“sponsored” or rel=“nofollow” attributes. This tells Google the links aren’t meant to influence rankings.\n\nAudit Your Site’s External Links\n\nNow that you know more about external linking, it's time to take it a step further. \n\nAnd that means routinely auditing your site. In this case, for external link issues. \n\nIf you don’t, your site can have errors that ruin your readers’ experiences and hurt your SEO. \n\nTo start, open Site Audit, enter your domain name, and click “Start Audit.”\n\nThen, configure your settings and click “Start Site Audit.” \n\nOnce it’s done, head to the “Issues” tab and type “external” into the search bar to filter by external link issues. \n\nAnd look for the following issues:\n\nBroken external links\nExternal links with unnecessary nofollow attributes\nLinks with no anchor text\nLinks with non-descriptive anchor text\n\nIf you aren’t sure where to start, click on “Why and how to fix it” next to any issue to learn more about it and get tips on how to fix it.\n\nPrioritize issues in the “Errors” list first, then “Warnings,” and then “Notices.”\n\nTip: Click on the “Settings” icon on the far right to schedule your audits to run weekly and to receive an email every time an audit is complete. \n\nFind and Fix External Link Errors\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
