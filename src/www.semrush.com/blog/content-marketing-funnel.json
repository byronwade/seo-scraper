  "content": "In this article, we’ll explain how to build a content marketing funnel that generates brand awareness, leads, and sales.\n\nWe’ll also share data from a survey we conducted in 2020, which polled 350 employees of digital marketing agencies and other organizations from around the world.\n\nWhat Is a Content Marketing Funnel?\n\nA content marketing funnel is a framework designed to help you create content for target audiences at various stages of the buying journey. And guide them toward becoming paying customers.\n\nThe main content marketing funnel stages are:\n\nTop of the funnel (ToFu): Content that builds awareness of the problem you can solve\nMiddle of the funnel (MoFu): Content that generates interest in your products or services\nBottom of the funnel (BoFu): Content that persuades prospects to become customers\n\nBelow is a visual representation of a content marketing funnel. The funnel shape represents the audience narrowing as poor-quality prospects drop out.\n\nLet’s look at the stages more closely. And find out which types of content are most suitable for each stage.\n\nTop-of-the-Funnel Content\n\nThe top of the funnel is the starting point of the buyer journey, and it's the most populated stage. Here, people aren’t yet ready to buy and might not have heard of your company. \n\nToFu content should attract your target audience’s attention, offer the best answer to their queries, educate them, and then gently introduce them to your brand. \n\nIf you focus on selling at this stage, you might drive people away.\n\nCreating ToFu Content\n\nTo attract users at the top of the content marketing funnel, choose content ideas that are relevant to your business. But not overtly promotional.\n\nIn other words, address the problems people have before they realize they need your products or services.\n\nThat way, you can attract valuable audiences, start to build positive relationships with them, and introduce your offerings in a tactful way later on.\n\nHere are some tips for ToFu content creation:\n\nFocus on solving the target audience’s pain points\nInclude internal links to other useful resources on your site\nBriefly introduce your products or services when relevant\nUse on-page SEO (improving your webpages for search engines and users) to help your content rank higher in search engines \n\nFor example, mattress brand Casper has a post about how to fix your sleep schedule. This attracts people who might need a new mattress but don’t know it yet.\n\nThe brand establishes expertise and trust by sharing data-backed tips. And gently directs readers toward relevant products or services.\n\nOne of the quickest ways to find content ideas is with Semrush’s Topic Research tool. \n\nJust enter a topic to find relevant subtopics you could cover.\n\nGet Content Ideas\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\nIdentifying the Best Types of ToFu Content\n\nThese are the top five types of content for attracting traffic to your site, according to our industry survey:\n\nHow-to guides: Text-based tutorials that help users achieve specific goals\nLanding pages: Webpages designed to encourage specific actions (e.g., form submissions)\nInfographics: Images that combine data visualizations with informative text\nChecklists: Resources that help users achieve a goal by checking items off a list\nEbooks: Digital booklets (usually in PDF format) that cover a specific topic in depth\n\nTip\n\nIt’s a good idea to see what content formats perform best for your topic in Google Search. You can check the non-personalized results in your target location with Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool. \n\nDistributing ToFu Content\n\nThe best distribution tactics for ToFu content are as follows, according to our industry survey:\n\nOrganic search (SEO): Getting unpaid rankings in relevant search engine results\nSocial media marketing: Sharing your content via platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn\nEmail marketing: Reaching out to people who’ve subscribed to your email updates\nPPC/paid advertising: Paying to promote your content through digital advertisements\nInfluencer marketing: Incentivizing relevant influencers to promote your content\nAnalyzing ToFu Content Metrics\n\nThe success of ToFu content is usually measured by these content marketing metrics, according to our survey:\n\nNumber of visitors: The number of unique users who visit your site or content\nConversion rate: The percentage of visits that generate a desired action (e.g., a form submission)\nTime on page: How long the average user remains on a given webpage\nNumber of leads: The number of users who express interest in your offerings (often by opting into communications from your business)\nBounce rate: The percentage of unengaged sessions on your site\n\nYou can track metrics like these with Google Analytics or another web analytics tool.\n\nTip\n\nLearn more about tracking your content’s success in our guide to content marketing metrics.\n\nMiddle-of-the-Funnel Content\n\nIn the middle of the content marketing funnel, users have identified the need for a particular product or service. And they’re evaluating their options.\n\nMoFu content should help target audiences understand the options available to them and position your solution as the best.\n\nCreating MoFu Content\n\nTo come up with ideas for MoFu content, consider what factors your customers research before buying.\n\nFor example:\n\nWhich brand should I buy from?\nWhat product or service type is right for me?\nWhat are the benefits of upgrading?\n\nBy helping people answer these kinds of questions, you can build trust with high-value prospects. And guide them toward a buying decision.\n\nFor example, mattress retailer Dreams has a mattress types guide:\n\nYou can afford to be self-promotional at this stage. Where appropriate, detail the benefits of your offering. And how it differs from competitors’. \n\nBut, you should provide impartial advice, too. To build trust with your audience.\n\nThe middle of the funnel is also a good place for lead generation. Because users at this stage are more willing to give their contact information in exchange for access to high-quality content.\n\nYou can then nurture the leads you acquire. This means maintaining relationships with them and guiding them toward the bottom of the funnel.\n\nIdentifying the Best Types of MoFu Content\n\nThese are the best types of content for generating leads, according to our survey:\n\nHow-to guides: Text-based tutorials that helps users achieve a specific goal\nProduct overviews: Detailed information about product features, benefits, specifications, etc.\nCase studies: Data-led reports about customers’ successes with a product or service\nLanding pages: Webpages designed to encourage specific actions (e.g., form submissions)\nWebinars: Online, interactive presentations about topics related to your business\n\nAnd these are the best types of content for nurturing leads:\n\nSuccess stories: Story-driven reports about customers’ successes with a product or service\nProduct overviews: Detailed information about product features, benefits, specifications, etc.\nCase studies: Data-led reports about customers’ successes with a product or service\nHow-to guides: Text-based tutorials that helps users achieve a specific goal\nCustomer reviews: Positive testimonials from previous customers\n\nThe content types are more solution-oriented to help nurture prospective customers into seeing the true benefits of your products or services.\n\nFor example, case studies can show how your products or services have affected other customers in positive and measurable ways. \n\nBut as motivation varies a lot at this stage, you should offer a wide choice of convincing materials and show different ways of using your products or services. \n\nDistributing MoFu Content\n\nThe best channels for generating leads are as follows, according to our industry survey:\n\nOrganic search (SEO): Getting unpaid rankings in relevant search engine results\nEmail marketing: Reaching out to people who’ve subscribed to your email updates\nSocial media marketing: Sharing your content via platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn\nPPC/paid advertising: Paying to promote your content through digital advertisements\nInfluencer marketing: Incentivizing relevant influencers to promote your content\n\nTip\n\nGet SEO recommendations for your chosen topic with the SEO Content Template tool. Then, use the SEO Writing Assistant to ensure you apply the recommendations effectively. \n\nThe best channels for nurturing leads are the same but in a slightly different order:\n\nEmail marketing\nSocial media marketing\nOrganic search (SEO)\nPPC/paid advertising\nInfluencer marketing\n\nGet Suggestions for SEO-Friendly Content\n\nwith Semrush’s Content Marketing Platform\n\nGet Started Now →\nAnalyzing MoFu Content Metrics\n\nThe success of MoFu content is usually measured by these metrics, according to our survey:\n\nConversion rate: The percentage of visits that generate a desired action (e.g., a form submission)\nNumber of leads: The number of users who express interest in your offerings (often by opting into communications from your business)\nNumber of visitors: The number of unique users who visit your site or content\nTime on page: How long the average user remains on a given webpage\nROI/ROMI: Return on (marketing) investment is how much revenue your marketing activities generate compared to their costs (e.g., a campaign that cost $10 and generated $20 had a 100% ROMI)\nBottom-of-the-Funnel Content\n\nAt the bottom of the content marketing funnel, prospects are ready to make a purchase. And they may or may not have chosen a provider.\n\nYou need to focus on giving prospects motivation to buy from you.\n\nCreating BoFu Content\n\nBoFu content should center around your products or services.\n\nYou need to emphasize any unique selling points, answer last-minute questions shoppers might have, and use psychology to your advantage.\n\nFor instance:\n\nCreate a sense of urgency: Discourage prospects from delaying their purchase by making them aware of low stock levels, limited-time deals, etc.\nLeverage social proof: People look to the actions and opinions of their peers before making a decision. So, it’s a good idea to talk about the number of happy customers you have.\nEstablish authority: Showcase accreditations (e.g., industry certifications) to assure prospects that you’re trustworthy and give them the confidence to make their purchase\nUse a call to action: Prompt visitors into action by telling them exactly what to do (e.g., “Start Your Free Trial”) \n\nThis Serta product page provides detailed information about the mattress’s features and benefits:\n\nIt also highlights many of the company’s unique selling points:\n\nAnd displays reviews from happy customers:\n\nIdentifying the Best Types of BoFu Content\n\nAccording to our survey, the top-performing content types for the BoFu stage are:\n\nProduct overviews: Detailed information about product features, benefits, specifications, etc.\nCustomer reviews: Positive testimonials from previous customers\nSuccess stories: Story-driven reports about customers’ successes with a product or service\nDistributing BoFu Content\n\nThese are the most efficient ways to get BoFu content noticed, according to our industry survey:\n\nEmail marketing: Reaching out to people who’ve subscribed to your email updates\nOrganic search (SEO): Getting unpaid rankings in relevant search engine results\nPPC/paid advertising: Paying to promote your content through digital advertisements\nAnalyzing BoFu Content Metrics\n\nOur industry respondents say the top BoFu content efficiency metrics are:\n\nConversion rate: The percentage of visits that generate a desired action (e.g., a form submission)\nNumber of payments: The number of sales transactions made by users who visit a given page\nROI/ROMI: Return on (marketing) investment is how much revenue your marketing activities generate compared to their costs (e.g., a campaign that cost $10 and generated $20 had a 100% ROMI)\n5 Tips for Building a Content Marketing Funnel\n\nHere are five tips to help you build a robust content marketing funnel:\n\n1. Understand Your Target Audience\n\nIt’s important to understand your target audiences’ needs, preferences, and behaviors at every stage of the buying journey.\n\nOnly then can you create and distribute content in the most effective ways possible.\n\nFor example, let’s consider how young professionals might engage with a mattress brand’s content at each stage of the funnel:\n\nToFu: Follow another site’s link to your blog post about reducing nightly screen time\nMoFu: Look at mattress recommendations from their favorite influencers on TikTok\nBoFu: Make a decision based on key factors like price and return policy\n\nBy comparison, here’s how older adults might engage with the same business:\n\nToFu: Follow a Google result to your blog post about reducing back pain\nMoFu: Take a quiz to determine if it’s time to replace their old mattress\nBoFu: Make a decision based on brand accreditations and reviews\n\nTo learn more about your audience segments, try One2Target.\n\nEnter a few competitors’ domains and click “Analyze.”\n\nYou can then see details about your competitors’ collective audience. Broken down by demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral information.\n\nYou can even see which social media platforms this audience uses most. To inform your distribution efforts.\n\nFor more information, check out our in-depth guide to learn how to do audience research.\n\n2. Perform Keyword Research\n\nConducting keyword research helps you find out what people search for in search engines like Google. \n\nYou can use it to find out what your target audiences are interested in at every stage of the marketing funnel. And optimize your content accordingly.\n\nTo get started, go to Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nEnter a general term related to your business, choose your target country, then click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will present a list of keywords that contain your starting term or a close variation.\n\nIn the “Intent” column, you’ll see the type of search intent behind each keyword. (The general purpose behind the average user’s search.)\n\nThis gives a strong indication of where the user is in the marketing funnel:\n\nI\n\n\t\n\nInformational\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to find information. They’re probably in the ToFu stage.\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\t\n\nCommercial\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to research brands, products, or services. They’re probably in the MoFu stage.\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\t\n\nNavigational\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to find a specific webpage. They’re probably in the MoFu or BoFu stage.\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\t\n\nTransactional\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to complete an action, such as a purchase. They’re probably in the BoFu stage.\n\nTip\n\nYou can filter your results by intent type in the “Advanced filters” drop-down.\n\nWe also recommend that you look at:\n\nVolume: The average number of monthly searches for the keyword\nKD %: The keyword difficulty score, which measures ranking difficulty out of 100\n\nWhen you identify a keyword of interest, click the icon to the right of the number in the “Com.” column.\n\nThis lets you see the Google search results. So you can determine what kind of content is most likely to perform well. And get a better understanding of your potential visitors.\n\nFor example, the results page for “best firm mattress” is dominated by comparison guides (MoFu). Rather than product pages (BoFu).\n\nThis suggests that people who search “best firm mattress” aren’t yet ready to buy. So, you should use that keyword in a MoFu piece that helps readers evaluate their options.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n3. Analyze Your Competitors’ Content\n\nGet insights and inspiration for your own content marketing funnel by analyzing competitors’ content.\n\nDoing this helps you:\n\nIdentify content gaps: Find out whether your audience has unmet needs you can address. By filling these gaps, you can direct more prospects into your content funnel.\nGather performance metrics: Learn from your competitors’ successes and mistakes. And create benchmarks for your own content strategy.\nDifferentiate your content: See what your competitors are already doing so you can find ways to stand out\n\nOne of the best ways to gather competitive insights is with Semrush’s Traffic Analytics tool.\n\nChoose your target location, enter up to five competitors’ domains, and then click “Analyze.”\n\nIn the “Top Pages” report, you can identify pages with growing or declining traffic volumes. And newly detected pages.\n\nFurther down, you’ll find data for all listed URLs. Including:\n\nNumber of visitors\nAverage visit duration\nTraffic sources\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Traffic\n\nwith the Traffic Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Get the Balance Right\n\nGenerally, it’s a good idea to work on lower-funnel content before upper-funnel content. Because there’s little point attracting prospects you’ll struggle to convert.\n\nBut don’t fall into the trap of focusing too much on BoFu content. \n\nNot only will this seriously limit your reach, but it’ll harm your ability to build trust with prospects. \n\nTo maximize conversions, you need a good balance of ToFu, MoFu, and BoFu content.\n\nHow do you find the right balance?\n\nBy measuring metrics in each stage of the content marketing funnel. And taking corrective action if you spot a weakness in any area.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is with the ImpactHero app. \n\nIt shows whether your performance is declining in any funnel stage:\n\nAnd it also lets you see which traffic sources bring the most/least visitors, user activities, and leads:\n\nFor the full workflow, check out this ImpactHero guide.\n\n5. Build Customer Loyalty\n\nLoyal customers can go through your content marketing funnel again and again. They might even direct other people to your funnel.\n\nSo, you should also create content that builds customer loyalty. Meaning it’s aimed at those who’ve already gone through the decision phase.\n\nFor example:\n\nProduct or service updates: Ensure customers know about the newest features\nExclusive content: Create content that’s accessible to previous customers only\nTutorials: Walk customers through how to use your products or services most effectively\nMake Your Content Funnel a Success\n\nThere’s a lot that goes into creating a robust content marketing funnel. But you can streamline the process with the right content creation tools.\n\nFor example, a free Semrush trial lets you:\n\nIdentify popular content topics and keywords\nLearn about your target audience\nOptimize your content for search engines\nAnalyze competitors’ content\n\nAnd much more.\n\nBuild Your Content Funnel\n\nwith Semrush’s Marketing Tools\n\nStart Free Trial →",
