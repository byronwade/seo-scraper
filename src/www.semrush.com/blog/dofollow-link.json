  "content": "What Is a Dofollow Link?\n\nA dofollow link is a regular hyperlink that doesn't have a special attribute like \"nofollow,\" \"ugc,\" or \"sponsored.\"\n\nThese links allow search engines to crawl them (i.e., scan to understand) and pass on link equity (i.e., ranking strength) to the linked site. Helping improve the linked site’s search engine rankings.\n\nWebsite owners don't need to do anything special to create dofollow links. They just have to add a regular link to their page using an anchor tag.\n\nLike this, for example:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.semrush.com\">Semrush</a>\n\nNote\n\nAlthough we use the term \"dofollow\" in this article, it's technically incorrect because there's no \"dofollow\" attribute. We just use the term as a way to reference this type of link. We also refer to them as “follow” links. \n\nDofollow vs. Nofollow Links\n\nNofollow links are different from follow links because nofollow links include a \"nofollow\" attribute.\n\nFor example, here's the same link with the rel=\"nofollow\" attribute added:\n\n<a href=\"https://semrush.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Semrush</a>\n\nThis attribute tells search engines not to crawl the link or pass on link equity to the linked site. So it generally doesn't contribute to improving the rankings of the linked site.\n\nWhy Are Dofollow Links Important?\n\nFollow links are important for both backlink building and improving your site's internal linking structure.\n\nWhen other websites link to your site with a follow link, they essentially endorse the content of your site. \n\nSearch engines take these signals seriously. And are more likely to rank your site higher in search results because of them.\n\nFollow links also play a crucial role in helping search engines discover and index (i.e., save) your website’s content.\n\nWhen you publish new pages and link to them from existing content using follow links, you're creating paths for search engine crawlers to find and index this new content more quickly.\n\nThis content then becomes eligible to appear in search results.\n\nPro tip\n\nFollow backlinks help your website gain rankings. Find your follow backlinks (and links you’ve lost) with Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool.\n \n\nJust go to the “Backlinks” tab within the tool. And click the “Follow” filter in the “Backlinks” section.\n \n\nWhen to Use a Dofollow Link\n\nAside from internal linking, here are some situations where you should use follow links:\n\nWhen linking to high-quality external websites and resources\nWhen citing original research or data from other websites\nWhen directing readers to additional information or resources on other sites\nWhen linking to your own social media profiles\nWhen linking to testimonials or reviews that highlight your product or service\nWhen Not to Use a Dofollow Link\n\nInstead of a standard follow link, use link attributes (e.g., nofollow, sponsored, and ugc) when linking to the following:\n\nPaid or sponsored content: If the link is part of a sponsored post or advertisement, it's best to use the rel=\"sponsored\" attribute. This helps ensure compliance with Google guidelines.\nUser-generated content (UGC): If you’re linking to content generated by users, such as comments or forum posts, use the rel=\"ugc\" attribute. This helps indicate to search engines that the content is user-generated and may not be fully endorsed by your site.\nUntrusted or low-quality websites: Avoid using follow links when linking to sites that are potentially unreliable or low quality. Search engines see follow links as votes of confidence. So a follow link to a low-quality site can harm your site's reputation.\nAffiliate links: For affiliate links, use a rel=\"sponsored\" attribute. This signals to search engines that the link is part of a commercial arrangement and not a natural endorsement.\nHow to Check if Your Backlinks Are Dofollow\n\nGiven that backlinks are extremely important for ranking, you want to make sure you're getting high-quality follow links to your site.\n\nHere’s how you can check if your backlinks are follow:\n\nInspect the Link on the Page\n\nVisit the page containing the backlink to your site. Then, right-click on the link and select \"Inspect\" from the context menu.\n\nLook at the HTML code for the link.\n\nIf it's a simple <a href=\"your-url\">anchor text</a> without any rel attributes, it's a follow link. If you see rel=\"nofollow\", rel=\"sponsored\", or rel=\"ugc\", then it's not a follow link.\n\nUse Semrush’s Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nGo to Semrush's Backlink Analytics tool. Enter your domain name and click \"Analyze\"\n\nThen, navigate to the \"Backlinks\" tab. And use the filters to view different types of links, including follow, nofollow, and those with other attributes.\n\nCheck Your Backlinks\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nStart Building Dofollow Links to Your Site\n\nYou understand the importance of follow links.
