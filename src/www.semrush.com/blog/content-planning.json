  "content": "What Is Content Planning?\n\nContent planning is how you define what content you’re going to publish, when, and where.\n\nWith an effective content plan (sometimes referred to as a “content calendar” or “editorial calendar”), you can prioritize tasks, organize the creation process, and keep track of your progress. \n\nCreating a content plan is a key step in any content strategy. \n\nNo matter the types of content you create (such as images, videos, or blog posts). Or the platforms you use to distribute it (such as Instagram, YouTube, or your blog). \n\nHere’s how to create your content plan, step by step. \n\n1. Build a Clear Content Strategy\n\nA content strategy defines your goals, target audience, distribution channels, and other essential elements guiding your content marketing efforts. A content plan, on the other hand, is a written document to manage the execution of this strategy. \n\nIt’s easier to understand with an example:\n\nSay you own an ecommerce website specializing in fitness products. \n\nA (very simplified) content strategy would state that you’re going to publish five videos per week. With a mix of workout tutorials and product reviews.\n\nYour content plan, on the other hand, would say that on Dec. 3, you want to publish a YouTube video analyzing the best running shoes between $50 and $100. \n\nAs you can see, your strategy sets the guidelines that shape your content plan. That’s why strategy must always go first. \n\nTo have a solid strategy, you need to have:\n\nMeasurable goals\nA good understanding of your audience\n\nNow that you know what a content plan is, let’s analyze these two elements.\n\n(If you already have measurable goals and a clear picture of your customers, jump to step #2). \n\nSet Goals\n\nContent marketing must have precise goals. There’s no point in creating content if you don’t know what you want to achieve with it. \n\nRemember that these goals have to be SMART. This is an acronym that stands for:\n\nSpecific\nMeasurable\nActionable\nRelevant\nTime-bound\n\nSome examples of SMART content marketing goals are:\n\nIf you’re updating blog articles to improve your SEO and bring more users to your site: Double organic traffic to our blog by March 2024 by updating five posts per week.\nIf you’re organizing a series of webinars to improve customer retention: Reduce churn by 5% during Q3 and Q4 of 2024 by organizing two product-focused webinars per month.\nIf you’re creating new YouTube videos to promote your products: Increasing ecommerce sales of kitchen products by 15% in Q2 by publishing two YouTube videos per week. \nUnderstand Your Audience\n\nAudience research is essential if you want to create content that meets your customers’ needs. \n\nHere's what you need to know about your customers:\n\nThe topics they’re interested in\nThe channels they use (Instagram, Google Search, Apple podcasts, etc.)\nThe formats they prefer (videos, blog posts, podcasts, etc.)\n\nPro tip: You can use our free buyer persona template to help you put this information into writing!\n\nHow to Perform Audience Research\n\nFeel like you don’t know enough about your audience to create effective content plans? Start with audience research. There are many ways to perform it. \n\nTwo quick and effective options are:\n\nReaching out to your customers or followers\nAnalyzing your data\n\nTalking to your customers (or followers) is the best way to understand the content they’d find valuable. \n\nYou can call them or send a personal email. Or you can save time by using surveys. \n\nFree tools like Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics, or Typeform make it easy to create customer surveys.\n\nSome social media platforms, such as Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn, also offer features to create your own polls.\n\nSide note: You can thank those who reply with a reward, like a raffle entry, discount code, or a free trial.\n\nAlways remember to check your customer data for insights about your audience.\n\nWith Google Analytics 4, for example, you can see information about your website’s users. \n\nClick on “Reports” in the left-side navigation menu.\n\nThen, “Demographics,” and “Demographics overview.”\n\nYou’ll be able to see your audience’s:\n\nLocation\nAge\nGender\nInterests\nLanguage\n\nIf the charts don’t show any data, go to “Admin,” > “Data Settings” > “Data Collection.”\n\nAnd click on the toggle beside “Enable Google signals data collection.”\n\nIf you’ve never set up Google signals data collection before, then click on the “Get started” button, instead, and follow the prompts that appear.\n\nSocial media platforms also give you valuable data about your followers. Each social media platform is different, but most give you access to your users' demographics (such as age and gender).\n\nThis is an example taken from Instagram Insights. (You’ll be able to access this feature with an Instagram business account.)\n\n2. Create Your Template\n\nYou can create a content plan with a simple spreadsheet. Or you can go one step further and use a project management tool. \n\nThere isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to planning content. Every company’s content plan will look different. \n\nStill, some elements are crucial. \n\nFor every content piece, you should include, at least:\n\nTitle\nFormat (e.g., 30-second video, blog article, ebook, etc.)\nPerson in charge\nPublication date\nStatus\n\nThose are the basics. \n\nBut each type of content has specific requirements, and you need to adapt content plans to those needs.\n\nLet’s see some content plan examples and what they should include:\n\nFor Social Media\n\nIf you’re posting content on social media, your content plan should include: \n\nCaption\nImage or video file\nHashtags\nLink\nDate & time (including time zone)\nTagged users\n\nThose elements are applicable to most of the leading social media platforms. \n\nHowever, each of these platforms is different, and you’ll need to adapt your content plan to them. \n\nFor example: \n\nFor YouTube, you could add a video thumbnail\nFor Instagram, you could add a list of products to tag\n\nAnd so on. \n\nLearn more about crafting a content strategy for social media.\n\nFor a Blog\n\nIf you’re publishing blog articles as part of your content plan, include the following: \n\nTitle\nType of article (listicle, how-to, etc.)\nAuthor\nTitle tag and meta description\nPrimary keyword\nSecondary keywords\nCTAs (calls to action)\nFor Podcasting \n\nIf your content plan includes creating podcasts, you could include: \n\nTitle and topic\nGuest’s name, bio, and contact information\nLink to the script\nDate and time of recording\nOriginal audio file\nEdited audio file\n3. Find the Right Topics\n\nSometimes, finding new, original topics to engage your target audience can be challenging. \n\nEspecially if you're a social media manager and need to publish several posts every week. \n\nLuckily, some tools can help.\n\nSemrush’s Topic Research tool is an excellent source of ideas. \n\nLet’s say you own a pet food delivery service and are looking for content inspiration. \n\nYou just need to go to the tool and type in a topic related to your business. Like “best dog food for senior dogs.” \n\nThen, hit the “Get content ideas” button.\n\nYou’ll get a list of related topics:\n\nIf you click on one of them, it will display a selection of articles ranking well on Google for that topic, under “Headlines.” As well as related searches and questions. \n\nThe “Subtopic Volume” (also referred to as “search volume”) is the average number of times a word or phrase is searched for on Google in a month. \n\nThe higher the volume, the higher the interest in the topic. \n\nAll this information is based on Google searches and can be helpful if you create blog articles.\n\nIt goes beyond blog articles, though:\n\nSearch volume shows interest in a topic.\n\nA user looking for something on Google likely wants to learn about it through other formats as well. Like social media posts, ebooks, or podcasts.\n\nSo, once you know the topics your customers are interested in, you can choose the type of content you want to produce.\n\nYou can create a blog post, a video for Instagram reels, or an ebook. It depends on your content strategy.\n\nYou can even create different types of content about the same topic.\n\nLet’s say you find out that users are looking for “kitchen decor trends” for the upcoming year. \n\nFirst, you can rely on your subject matter expertise to draft a list of trends. \n\nThen, you can create several Instagram posts out of it (one per trend), a TikTok video, and a blog article. \n\nYou can “recycle” the same information into different formats. This is called “content repurposing.”\n\nYou can also check the words and phrases (keywords) users search for on Google. \n\nSemrush offers many ways to find keyword ideas. \n\nFor instance, with Semrush’s Organic Research tool, you can look at the keywords your competitors rank for on Google.\n\nIf you’re interested, check out this keyword research guide. \n\nYou can also find new topic ideas for your content plan on social media. More specifically, on your competitors’ social media profiles. \n\nYou can do so with Semrush’s Social Media Tracker. \n\nThis tool tracks social media accounts, growth, and engagement levels for both you and your competitors. Once you add a social profile to your campaign, the tool collects data from the previous 60 days (30 days for YouTube).\n\nThe “Top Content by Channel” section shows the top-performing pieces of content in your niche. You can use them as inspiration for your own posts. \n\n4. Assign Tasks (and Set Deadlines)\n\nUnless you’re a one-person team, you’ll need to assign tasks and deadlines to organize the content development process. This is an important step to improve your content planning process.\n\nSay you want to create an Instagram video to announce that all purchases in your store get free shipping for a limited time.\n\nYour tasks (and deadlines) could look like this:\n\nWrite video script and Instagram caption\nIn charge: Social media manager\nDeadline: September 25 \nEdit video\nIn charge: Video editor\nDeadline: September 27 \nActivate ecommerce coupon\nIn charge: Ecommerce manager\nDeadline: September 29 \nPublish reel\nIn charge: Social media manager\nDeadline: September 29\n\nPro tip: Remember to factor in extra days to compensate for any delay when setting deadlines. This is especially important if you need to receive approvals before publishing.\n\n5. Schedule in Advance \n\nIf your distribution channels allow it, it’s a good idea to schedule your content. Scheduling content in advance will help you stay organized and avoid last-minute problems when planning content. \n\nThis is especially important for time-sensitive content, such as social media posts or newsletters. \n\nThere are many types of content and platforms, each of which has its particularities regarding content scheduling.\n\nSome channels that have built-in scheduling features are: \n\nFacebook business\nInstagram business\nPinterest business\nLinkedIn company pages\nYouTube\nWordPress\nAnchor\nMost email marketing tools, such as Mailchimp and Substack\n\nWith Semrush’s Social Media Poster, you can schedule posts for Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn company pages (and Google Business Profile). All from a single dashboard.\n\nTo set up the tool, you’ll need to connect your social media profiles.\n\nThen, you just need to click on “New post.”\n\nAnd fill out the information in the form that appears. The tool will publish your post for you at the right time.\n\nPro tip: If you already have your content plan in a spreadsheet and want to speed things up, you can use the bulk scheduling feature. Just click on “Bulk scheduling” and upload your CSV.\n\n6. Measure the Results\n\nContent planning is an ongoing task. Over time, you need to know what’s working and improve your strategy.\n\nSo, how do you measure your results?\n\nFirst, you need to monitor your overall content marketing goals. \n\n(If you’re unsure about what those look like, a content marketing goal could be to increase lead generation by 15% in three months.)\n\nThese goals are part of your content strategy and should shape all your marketing efforts. \n\nBut there’s more you should be looking at.\n\nTo make sure you reach your overall goals, you must monitor how each content piece performs.\n\nThis will help you understand what’s working and what’s not. And react accordingly. \n\nBut remember that metrics are different for each type of content. \n\nSome examples are:\n\nFor Social Media Content\nReach\nImpressions\nEngagement (likes, shares, comments)\nFollower growth\nFor Blog Posts\nPage views\nAverage time on page\nBounce rate\nBacklinks\nFor Podcasts\nListeners\nDownloads\nAverage listening time\nReviews\n\nCheck this article to learn more about content marketing metrics.\n\nBuild Your First Content Plan\n\nReady to start your content planning process?
