  "content": "What Are AI Models?\n\nArtificial intelligence models are computer programs that aim to replicate aspects of human intelligence. Developers input rules (known as algorithms) that allow the program to make decisions, notice patterns, and make predictions.\n\nSuccessful models have a user-friendly interface. That means new users can interact with it without much direction.\n\nFor example, Bing Chat is an AI-powered chatbot app that can have back-and-forth conversations with users:\n\nPeople type messages into the text box and the software replies—thanks to the accessible interface.\n\nHowever, it’s the AI model that does the heavy lifting. It runs in the background and provides relevant answers to questions it has never encountered before.\n\nUsers don’t interact with the AI model directly. But it powers the whole experience.\n\nArtificial intelligence is a complex topic with a lot of overlapping terminology. So, let’s clear a few things up.\n\nArtificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning\n\nThink of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning as one big tree. \n\nThe trunk is AI. And one of its biggest branches is machine learning (ML). But that big branch splits into several smaller branches. One of them is deep learning (DL).\n\nWhat’s the bottom line?\n\nAll are connected. But each term doesn’t refer to the same process.\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\nImage Source: Singapore Computer Society\n\nNow, let’s get a tad more technical.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to simulate human intelligence in software and machines. \n\nAs far back as 2017, experts predicted AI would be able to do everything from translating essays to working in retail and performing surgery. Those forecasts gained even more steam with the creation of programs like ChatGPT.\n\nThese chatbots can’t completely match the level of a human brain yet. But they can carry out certain tasks. And already outperform humans in some areas like data science and strategy.\n\nFor example, AI can process huge volumes of data in seconds. Something that would take a human data scientist hours to do. \n\nMachine Learning\n\nDevelopers create algorithms to help programs pick up on patterns in data, similar to how humans learn. We call this process machine learning. \n\nFor example, Netflix uses machine learning to analyze movie choices and make recommendations for its subscribers.\n\nWith deep learning, things get even more specialized.\n\nDeep Learning\n\nDeep learning is a more complex subset of machine learning. In this case, developers teach computers with methods inspired by the human brain (known as neural networks). \n\nFor example, healthcare image recognition (like detecting diseases in MRIs) is an example of deep learning at work. It can perform these complex tasks without human intervention. \n\nThere’s sometimes overlap among these three terms. \n\nFor example, self-driving cars utilize artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.\n\nIn all these cases, programs learn from examples and experience to make accurate decisions. Without extra help from humans.\n\nSo, all these processes are cogs in one larger AI model.\n\nHow Do AI Models Work?\n\nAI models usealgorithms to recognize patterns and trends in data. Multiple algorithms working together comprise an AI program or “model.”\n\nMany people use the terms “model” and “algorithm” interchangeably. But that is inaccurate. \n\nAlgorithms can work alone. But AI models can’t work without algorithms.\n\nHuman creators use artificial neural networks made up of connections or “synapses” to mimic how a brain sends information and signals via neurons. But in this case, the “neurons” are processing units in layers.\n\nHere’s what they look like:\n\nImage Source: IBM\n\nLike humans, AI models are on a sliding scale of complexity and intelligence. The more training data they have to “learn” from, the more intelligent they’ll be.\n\nThink of a model as a child. \n\nIt doesn’t know the answer to a specific question unless you provide it. You teach it enough and when you ask again, it remembers the answer.\n\nModels can learn from thousands or millions of examples to generate predictions or classifications. So when you feed new data into them (like a question), they can predict the data you’re looking for (an answer).\n\nBut there is more than one type of AI model.\n\n4 Types of AI Models and What They Do\n\nAll the below models are types of generative AI. Which means they can generate content, like text or images. \n\nBut each one on this AI models list works a little differently:\n\n1. Foundation Models\n\nFoundation models are machine learning models pre-trained to perform tasks. We call this process “self-supervised learning.”\n\nPopular tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing Chat utilize foundation models, for example. \n\nDevelopers train foundation models on a vast amount of data with neural networks. So, the model can adapt to different use cases when you need it to. (Like a human brain can.)\n\nPeople use foundation models across a wide range of scenarios. For example:\n\nAnswering questions\nWriting essays and stories\nSummarizing chunks of information\nGenerating code\nSolving math problems\n2. Multimodal Models\n\nMultimodal models learn from multiple types (or “modes”) of data like images, audio, video, and speech. Because of that, they can respond with a greater variety of results.\n\nThat’s why many foundation models are now multimodal:\n\nImage Source: arXiv:2108.07258\n\nA popular type of multimodal AI is a vision-language model. It “sees” visual inputs (like pictures and videos) through a process called computer vision.\n\nIn other words, it can extract information from visuals.\n\nThese hybrids can caption images, create images, and answer visual questions. For example, the text-to-image generator DALL-E 2 is a multimodal AI model.\n\nLearning from a more extensive range of mediums allows these models to offer more accurate answers, predictions, and decision-making. It also helps them better understand the data’s context.\n\nFor example, “back up” can mean to move in reverse. Or make a copy of data. \n\nA model that has “seen” and understands examples of both will be more likely to make the right prediction.\n\nIf a user is talking about computers, they’re more likely referring to the data version. If a user is talking about a car accident video, the AI system assumes it’s likely directional.\n\n3. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) can understand and generate text. They use deep learning methods combined with natural language processing (NLP) to converse like humans.\n\nTwo branches comprise natural language processing:\n\nNLU: Natural language understanding\nNLG: Natural language generation\n\nBoth of these working together allow AI models to process language similarly to people.\n\nHow?\n\nThey learn from millions of examples to accurately predict the next word in a phrase or sentence. For example, the autocomplete feature on your cellphone is a type of NLP.\n\nHere’s what the simplified process looks like:\n\nImage Source: AssemblyAI\n\nGoogle’s BERT is a more sophisticated, neural network-based NLP. However, the training process involves a similar simple task that helps the model learn relationships between sentences:\n\nImage Source: Google Research\n\nThrough its training, BERT learns that “The man went to the store. He bought a gallon of milk” is a logical sequence. But “The man went to the store. Penguins are flightless” isn’t.\n\nThe “large” in LLMs refers to the fact developers train them with huge datasets. Which allows them to translate, categorize, conduct sentiment analysis, and generate content.\n\nThat’s why fields like healthcare are implementing them rapidly. Many healthcare LLMs use the BERT architecture:\n\nBioBERT: A domain-specific model pre-trained on biomedical data\nClinicalBERT: A domain-specific model pre-trained on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from intensive care patients\nBlueBERT: A domain-specific model pre-trained on clinical notes and abstracts from the online database PubMed\n\nAll these programs can understand, classify, and respond to patient queries faster and more efficiently.\n\n4. Diffusion Models\n\nDiffusion models split images into tiny pieces to analyze patterns and features. They can then reference these pieces to create new AI-generated images.\n\nThe process involves adding “noise” to break up images. Then, reversing and “denoising” the image to generate new combinations of features.\n\nHere’s what the process looks like, simplified:\n\nImage Source: CMSWire\n\nLet’s say a user asks for a picture of an elephant. A diffusion model recognizes elephants have long trunks, large ears, and round bodies.\n\nSo it can refer to all the images it’s learned from to recreate these features.\n\nHowever, different diffusion model tools generate different images for the same input.\n\nFor example, here are images from Stable Diffusion, DALLE-2, and Midjourney for the prompt “Cherry blossom near a lake, snowing”:\n\nImage Source: Marktechpost\n\nWhy do they differ?\n\nBecause the companies creating these cutting-edge AI tools have different architectures, objectives, and training mechanisms.\n\nSo each model refers to separate, varying datasets when combining features for a “lake” or “cherry blossom.”\n\nExamples of Popular Marketing Tools That Use AI Models\n\nPeople use different AI models to create tools for a range of complex tasks. Let’s look at popular options small business owners and marketers would find most helpful:\n\nChatGPT: GPT-3.5 \n\nChatGPT is OpenAI’s advanced chatbot that uses the latest GPT LLM to generate relevant, human-like responses to prompts.\n\nFor example, here’s how it responded to the prompt “Explain how you work in a few lines:”\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer:\n\nGenerative: Means it generates content\nPre-trained: Means the OpenAI team inputted data (known as pre-training) to help the system understand and respond to specific tasks\nTransformer: Means it uses deep learning capabilities to consider the context of words and predict what comes next\n\nChatGPT uses the GPT-3.5 model for free users and the latest GPT-4 version for paid plans.\n\nAsk ChatGPT a question, and it’ll answer you conversationally.\n\nBut that’s not all it does. The tool can also:\n\nCreate marketing content (e.g., social media posts, email newsletters, or landing page copy)\nWrite cold email templates\nBreak down complicated concepts in simple terms\nTranslate text into multiple languages\nCreate spreadsheet formulas and solve math problems\nSummarize and categorize huge documents and meeting notes\n\nChatGPT can generate inaccurate and sometimes biased information. So always double-check any content you use it to create (especially for marketing purposes).\n\nSemrush Tools: ChatGPT API\n\nSeveral Semrush AI writing tools use ChatGPT API to help marketers streamline and optimize their processes. Including SEO Writing Assistant, AI Writing Assistant, and ContentShake.\n\nLet’s dive into SEO Writing Assistant as an example. Use it to check the originality and SEO potential of your articles:\n\nHere’s how:\n\nLaunch the tool and hit “Analyze my text.”\n\nFrom the dashboard, add your targeted keywords and begin typing. (You can also import content directly from an existing URL.) Once you’re done, click “Get recommendations.”\n\nAI automation scans your content and the top relevant search results on Google. Then, recommends improvements like:\n\nKeywords your audience is searching for that you’ve missed\nSections you could make more original\nAreas that could use a higher readability score\nLines where your tone is inconsistent with the rest of the article\n\nAI features in the right sidebar include “Rephraser,” “Compose,” and “Ask AI”:\n\nThese features can prevent writer’s block by helping you write and rewrite pieces of text.\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nUse SEO Writing Assistant and other AI-based Semrush tools to:\n\nMaintain a uniform tone in all your content marketing efforts\nOptimize your blog posts for search engines and human readers\nImprove your article’s grammar before it goes live\nBoost your content’s readability\n\nAll with the help of AI models in the background.\n\nGet Writing Recommendations\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\nGoogle Bard: PaLM 2 \n\nBard is Google’s free experimental chatbot that uses the second version of an LLM called Pathways Language Model (PaLM).\n\nIts original AI model was the Language Model for Dialogue Applications (or LaMDA for short). However, PaLM 2 is better at reasoning, translating, and coding.\n\nGoogle designed Bard to be a complementary experience to Search. It works by searching the web in real time for answers. Then, uses its findings to converse with users.\n\nFor example, here’s how it responded to the prompt “What’s the weather like in Monticello, Utah?”:\n\nIs there any answer you’re not sure about or want to explore further? Visit Google’s search engine directly within the interface with a single click.\n\nBard can help you:\n\nCome up with marketing ideas\nDiscover relevant tips and tricks\nSwitch up your writing’s tone\nTranslate English into multiple languages\nSummarize text and data\nGenerate content (e.g., ecommerce product page copy)\n\nWhen it quotes or includes images, Bard links to sources and citations. This sourcing is a helpful feature other popular chatbots are missing.\n\nDALL-E 2: GLIDE\n\nDALL-E 2 is OpenAI’s text-to-image generator that uses a multimodal model called GLIDE. It stands for Guided Language to Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing.\n\nOpenAI used the GLIDE model to improve the original DALL-E. And allow DALL-E 2 to have higher image resolutions and higher-quality photorealism.\n\nDALL-E 2 produces AI images from text prompts. The visuals look like human-created sketches, illustrations, paintings, and photos.\n\nFor example, here’s what it came up with for the prompt “a photo of a spiky hedgehog laying in the grass”:\n\nThe tool will always generate four variations of AI images that it thinks best match your prompt.\n\nYou can use DALL-E 2 images in all types of marketing content. For example:\n\nBlog articles\nSocial media posts\nLanding pages\nEmail newsletters\nCommunity forums\n\nHeinz Ketchup even created an entire marketing campaign around DALL-E 2:\n\nImage Source: Creative Bloq\n\nIt was so clever and topical that it won the marketing agency several awards.\n\nFurther reading: DALL-E 2 byOpenAI: How to Create Digital Art in a Few Seconds\n\nStable Diffusion XL Playground: Stable Diffusion\n\nStable Diffusion XL is an AI image generator that uses Stable Diffusion’s API. It’s an open-source model, which means its code is available to the public. So any creator can use its capabilities to set up models and build tools.\n\nThat’s why many users believe Midjourney (another popular AI image generator) uses the Stable Diffusion model. But the team hasn’t confirmed that.\n\nYou can create free images using Stable Diffusion XL in its online Playground. Enter your prompt, choose your style, and generate a result.\n\nFor example, here’s what it came up with for “a horse running through a candy cane forest” in cinematic style:\n\nWant images without watermarks?\n\nYou’ll need Stable Diffusion’s official AI application, DreamStudio. \n\nLike DALL-E, you can use Stable Diffusion’s tools to add visuals to any marketing material. \n\nUse Semrush’s AI Models to Create Content\n\nThere’s no one “best” AI model out there for creating or using marketing tools. There’s only the best fit for your needs.\n\nAnd you’ll only work out your preferences by trying each of them out.\n\nSo start with SEO Writing Assistant, AI Writing Assistant, and ContentShake.
