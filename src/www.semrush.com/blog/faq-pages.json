  "content": "What Is an FAQ Page?\n\nAn FAQ page is a dedicated page on a website that answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to the business.\n\nMany businesses have FAQ pages to help site visitors understand their products and services. And solve common problems.\n\nFor example, here’s Stella & Chewy’s FAQ page:\n\nIt’s an effective FAQ page because it anticipates the audience's needs. It also answers common questions and guides visitors to other relevant site content.\n\nFAQ pages may also include questions and answers about:\n\nCommon industry questions\nOperating hours\nReturn policies\nPayment options\nShipping information\nContact options\nJobs\n\nPro tip\n\nWant to start building an FAQ page but don’t know where to start? Find questions that your customers are actually searching for with the Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nWhy You Need an FAQ Page\n\nHere are the benefits of having an FAQ page.\n\nIt Increases Site Traffic and Online Visibility\n\nWhen people search for answers related to your business, your FAQ page can appear in search results. So creating an optimized FAQ page can improve your online presence.\n\nFor example, WhatsApp’s FAQ page about disappearing messages is a featured snippet on the Google results page:\n\nFAQ pages are good for SEO as they have the potential to drive significant, relevant organic traffic. By targeting question keywords that potential customers use to learn more about your brand or products.\n\nFor example, WhatsApp’s FAQ page gets 650.8K visitors per month, according to Semrush’s Organic Research tool.\n\nBecause the page is ranking in the top 10 for several high-volume question keywords, like:\n\n“How to know if someone blocked you” - 4.4K searches per month\n“How to download whatsapp” - 1.3K searches per month\n“How to delete whatsapp group” - 1.6K searches per month\nIt Improves the Customer Experience\n\nAn FAQ page improves the customer experience. Because it helps users get answers faster. Rather than having to dig deep into your website or reach out to customer service.\n\nMore specifically, FAQ pages do the following:\n\nGive potential customers information to aid their decision-making process\nMake key information readily available, which shows that your business is transparent and values customer satisfaction\n\nWhen people find answers to their questions, they may forgo contacting support. Which can save your staff time and resources.\n\nIt Strengthens Your Authoritativeness\n\nFAQ content establishes authority, giving you an edge over competitors who may not be openly addressing common questions.\n\nFor example, Stella & Chewy’s uses their FAQ page to establish that they are dog food experts. By answering questions like, “How do I transition (my dog to new food)?”\n\nDoing this can demonstrate your expertise. Because your answers showcase your knowledge. Which can lead to increased customer trust.\n\n8 Great FAQ Page Examples\n\nStruggling to come up with your own FAQ page?\n\nHere are eight great examples for your inspiration.\n\n1. The IRS\n\nBecause the IRS is a government entity, it makes sense that their FAQ page design is less creative.\n\nBut they offer a great user experience. If visitors have a specific question or topic, they can use the search bar at the top of the page.\n\nThe answer to each question is “hidden” behind a drop-down, so users can skim the page quickly and only click on the questions they want.\n\n2. Amazon Web Services\n\nThe Amazon Web Services FAQ page uses a simple, easy-to-navigate design.\n\nIf you continue to scroll down, the page includes many links under different categories. \n\nOnce you click on a topic, you’ll find an accompanying article with additional questions and answers within that topic.\n\n3. Target\n\nTarget’s main domain has a help section to assist users with orders, returns, etc.\n\nHowever, its corporate domain has more specific FAQ pages targeting different user segments (like “Media” and “Careers”).\n\nThe average Target shopper probably isn’t interested in these categories. So it makes sense to separate them.\n\n4. Planet Fitness\n\nPlanet Fitness is a gym chain known for its beginner-friendly simplicity. Its FAQ page follows suit:\n\nIts initial FAQ page has a list of common questions with drop-down-style answers.\n\nIf you scroll further down, you’ll see a section labeled “More Topics.” That directs you to additional FAQs depending on what information you need.\n\nIt also includes an option to contact your Planet Fitness club directly.\n\n5. Dunkin’\n\nThis famous coffee chain’s FAQ page keeps things simple.\n\nUsers can toggle between a few different categories on the top navigation bar. Or navigate directly to their most popular questions:\n\nAnd once users find what they need, they can click a drop-down to view easy-to-skim related questions:\n\n6. Lily’s Kitchen\n\nPet food brand Lily’s Kitchen categorizes their questions on the left-hand side of the FAQ page.\n\nIf users can’t find answers, they can contact Lily’s Kitchen’s customer service team using the link under the main heading.\n\n7. Kiehl’s\n\nSkincare brand Kiehl’s also helps visitors find answers through a left-hand navigation menu.\n\nIt also has a search bar so people can look for something specific. \n\nThe page also includes links to popular questions so users can get answers quickly.\n\n8. Yasso\n\nThis frozen yogurt brand’s FAQ page starts with a number of clickable category links:\n\nIf you click on one or scroll further, you’ll find a drop-down menu of more specific questions:\n\nThis FAQ page uses brand colors and design. To further encourage brand recall.\n\nHow to Create an Effective FAQ Page\n\nCreate an FAQ page that drives traffic and helps customers. With these five tips.\n\nUncover Questions Your Customers Actually Ask\n\nThe primary goal of your FAQ page is to answer your customers’ and potential customers’ questions. So that they don’t need to contact your support team every time they need help.\n\nThere are two ways you can uncover what those questions are:\n\nFirst, ask your customer support and sales teams.\n\nThose two teams coordinate with customers on a daily basis. Ask them to compile recurring questions. And add those questions to your FAQ page.\n\nIf you’re using help desk or call center software like Intercom or Zendesk, review the customer data.\n\nThis includes listening to recorded calls, looking through written details about specific customer issues, etc.\n\nSecond, use Google Search Console. To see questions that you’re already ranking for.\n\nNote\n\nIf you haven’t set up this free tool yet, follow the steps in Google Search Console: The Ultimate Guide.\n\nSign in to Search Console and select your site in the property drop-down.\n\nNext, click on the “Performance” tab in the left-hand navigation menu.\n\nAnd scroll down to “Queries” to see a list of search terms that you’re already ranking for.\n\nNow, let’s narrow that list of queries. Into a list of question keywords.\n\nCreate a filter by clicking “+ New” > “Query…” at the top of the screen.\n\nAnd, hit “Custom (regex).”\n\nFinally, paste the following expression into the open field. And click the “Apply” button.\n\n^(how|what|when|where|who|why)[\" \"]\n\nThe table will show you all question-based search queries.\n\nComb through the list to choose the most relevant questions for your business. And add them to your FAQ page.\n\nResearch Question Keyword Opportunities\n\nKeyword research can help you identify questions people enter into search engines.\n\nStart your research by plugging your industry or brand name into the Semrush Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nLet’s use the cosmetics company Lush to demonstrate. \n\nEnter the brand name, choose your target country, and click the “Search” button.\n\nYou’ll see a list of keywords related to “Lush.”\n\nClick the “Questions” filter button near the top left-hand corner of the report.\n\nAnd click on the “Volume” column to arrange by search volume (i.e., the estimated number of searches a keyword gets per month).\n\nNow, you’ll see a list of questions related to your brand. With the keywords that get the most searches per month at the top.\n\nAs you did with Search Console, choose the most relevant questions for your business. While considering their search popularity.\n\nFollow a Logical Category Structure\n\nA great FAQ page is easy to navigate. So that visitors can find what they need as quickly as possible.\n\nTo do that, create clear category sections based on the question type.\n\nFor example, the Shopify FAQ page categorizes questions into four sections. In a left-hand navigation menu:\n\nSome common FAQ categories include:\n\nGeneral questions\nAccount and registration\nOrdering and payment\nShipping\nReturns\nProduct information\nTechnical support\nPrivacy and security\nContact information\n\nPro tip\n\nThere are many ways to display your FAQs. Download four FAQ page templates for ideas.\n\nAnswer Questions Clearly and Concisely\n\nWhen visitors land on your FAQ page, they’re likely looking for quick answers. So keep your answers clear and concise.\n\nLet’s take Dunkin’s FAQ page. Many of the answers are one or two sentences. And get right to the point.\n\nConsider User Experience\n\nIf you want your site visitors to leave happy, improve your FAQ page's user experience.\n\nAdd helpful elements like search functionality and drop-down menus to make your page easier to navigate.\n\nPeople will land on your FAQ page with a specific question in mind. Make it easy for them to find answers by adding a search field (especially if your page is too long to skim).\n\nFor example, here’s the IRS’ FAQ page with a search bar at the top:\n\nYou can also include drop-downs within your categories.\n\nAdobe breaks up their left-hand navigation categories with drop-down arrows. This allows them to include a lot of information on one page without confusing or overwhelming the user.\n\nCreate Better FAQ Pages with Semrush\n\nAn FAQ page is a beneficial asset for both your site visitors and SEO. But for it to be effective, you need to optimize it properly and include the right questions.\n\nInspired by the FAQ page examples in this guide?\n\nWith Semrush’s suite of tools, you can create an FAQ page that meets users' needs and ranks well in the search engines.\n\nSign up for a free account today!\n\nCreate FAQ Pages that Rank\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nThis post was updated in 2024.
