  "content": "What Is a Reverse Image Search?\n\nA reverse image search involves using an image to look for similar images online.\n\nFor example, check out this Google reverse image search results page:\n\nWe provided Google with the image on the left. And it returned the related images on the right.\n\nNote\n\nThe process for doing a reverse image search with Bing is very similar. But we’ll be focusing on how to conduct a reverse image search with Google in this article. \n\nBy clicking any image in these results, we can get more information on the object in it. Like its name. Or (if it’s a product) where to buy it.\n\nConducting a reverse image search is also useful if you want to:\n\nFind an image’s source\nCheck for image theft\nBuild backlinks\n\nPro tip\n\nIf you’re using reverse image searches to build backlinks, keep track of your progress with Backlink Analytics. You can even use filters to see which new backlinks you acquired in a specific timeframe.\n \n\nTrack Your Backlinks\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Do a Google Reverse Image Search on Mobile Devices\n\nFollow these steps to do a reverse image search using the Google app on an iOS device.\n\nThe steps are similar if you’re using the Google app on an Android device. Or the Google search engine on any mobile device.\n\nTo start, download the Google app from the app store. Open the app and use one of the below options to do a reverse image search:\n\nUsing Your Camera\nTap the camera icon to the right of the Google app’s search bar\nTap the camera icon at the top of the screen\nTap “Allow” to let the app access your camera\nTap “Continue”\nPoint your device at an object for which you want to do a reverse image search\nTap the magnifying glass button to take a photo of the object\nThe app will isolate the object in the photo. And list relevant image results below.\nTap an image result you’re interested in\nClick “Visit” to visit the image result’s page\nUsing an Image Search Result\n\nFor this method, you’ll navigate to the relevant image search result based on a standard Google search. And then do a reverse image search based on that result.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nType your search query into the Google app’s search bar. Then, tap “search” on your keyboard to run the search.\nTap the “Images” tab at the top of the search results to view your query’s image results\nTap the image search result you’re interested in to expand it\nTap the camera icon at the bottom left of the image search result\nCrop handles will appear. Drag them to isolate an object in the image for which you want to do a reverse image search.\nGoogle will display image results relevant to the isolated object\nTap the image result you’re interested in\nClick “Visit” to visit the image result’s page\nUsing an Image in Your Image Library\nTap the camera icon to the right of the Google app’s search bar\nTap the “Allow access” button under the screen’s “Search with any image” section\nSelect either “Limit Access…” or “Allow Full Access.” Which will depend on whether you want to grant the app partial or full access to your image library.\nTap the image in your image library that you want to do a reverse image search for\nThe app will isolate the photo’s main subject. And list relevant image results below.\nTap the image result you’re interested in\nClick “Visit” to visit the image result’s page\nUsing a Website Image\n\nFirst, save the website image to your device:\n\nOpen the Chrome browser app\nNavigate to the website image for which you want to do a reverse image search\nTap and hold the image to display the image options\nTap “Save in Photos” to save the image to your image library\n\nThen, do a reverse image search using the method from the previous section.\n\nHow to Do a Google Reverse Image Search on Desktop Devices\n\nNow, here’s how to do a Google reverse image search on a desktop device.\n\nNavigate to the Google homepage. Then, choose one of these three search methods:\n\nUsing an Image URL\n\nThis method involves finding an image’s URL and then using it to do a reverse image search.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nNavigate to the image you want to do a reverse image search for in the image results\nRight-click the image and select “Copy Image Address”\nGo to Google’s homepage and click the camera icon to the right of the search bar\nPaste your image URL into the “Paste image link” field. Then, click “Search.”\nGoogle will display relevant image results\nClick the image result you’re interested in to visit its page in a new tab\nUsing an Image from Your File Directory\nOn the Google homepage, click the camera icon to the right of the search bar\nDrag an image into the upload box. Or click “upload a file” to upload the image from your file directory.\nGoogle will display relevant image results\nClick the image result you’re interested in to visit its page in a new tab\n\nTip\n\nThis method also works for doing a reverse video search. Take a screenshot of a video scene you want to get more information on. Then, upload the screenshot from your file directory.\n\nUsing an Image Search Result\n\nFor this method, use a standard Google search to find an image you want to look up and then use it in a reverse image search.\n\nLike this:\n\nGo to Google’s homepage and enter your query in the search bar. Then, hit “enter” or “return” on your keyboard to run the search.\nClick the “Images” tab at the top of the search results to view your query’s image results\nClick the image search result you’re interested in to expand it\nClick the camera icon at the bottom left of the image search result\nCrop handles will appear. Drag them to isolate an object you want to do a reverse image search for.\nGoogle will display image results relevant to the isolated object\nClick the image result you’re interested in\nClick “Visit” to visit the image result’s page\nReasons to Use a Reverse Image Search\n\nReverse image searches are useful if you want to:\n\nBuild Backlinks\n\nDoing a reverse image search for visuals you created to be shared is a good way to find websites that use them. And ask for backlinks (links from other websites that point to your website) in the image credit.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the more backlinks your website gets from authoritative websites, the higher it may rank in the search results.\n\nLet’s say you created an infographic you’re hoping others will share on their websites.\n\nDo a reverse image search using it and visit each image result.\n\nCheck whether there’s an attribution line that links to your website. (If there’s no credit at all and you haven’t granted the website permission to use your image, that’s image theft. Which we’ll cover later on.)\n\nIf you find websites that haven’t included backlinks, reach out. And ask them for one.\n\nUse the Link Building Tool to simplify this process.\n\nFollow the Link Building Tool configuration guide to set up your project. \n\nThen, head to the “Prospects” tab. And click “+ Add” under the “Uploaded” box.\n\nAdd the domains you found using your image without linking back to you and click “Add new domains.”\n\nClick “Show results” in the pop-up that appears to add these domains as prospects.\n\nThey’ll then show in the tool. Like this:\n\nThen, click the arrow next to the “To In Progress” button for each of these domains and select “Link from mention.”\n\nThis will send them to the “In Progress” tab. Where you can craft personalized emails asking those who’ve used your image to include a link to you in the attribution.\n\nIdentify Sites for Backlink Building\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nSign up Now →\nLearn More about an Object\n\nDoing a reverse image search is especially helpful if you don’t know what the object is called. Which makes searching for it with text difficult.\n\nGetting this information is simple. Just upload an image of it to a visual search engine like Google.\n\nFind an Image’s Source\n\nYou can discover an image’s source or creator using a reverse image search. So you can provide appropriate credit if you’re using it.\n\nFollow the instructions above to do a Google reverse image search using an image URL or an image you’ve saved to your library. And click “Find image source” at the top.\n\nThen, browse the results to learn who the image’s creator is.\n\nEven if a website you click through to isn’t the image’s original source, it may have provided image credit. Use that credit to identify the image’s creator.\n\nLooking for older publish dates may also help. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the oldest result may be for the image’s first use. By the creator themselves.\n\nJust know this technique isn’t perfect. \n\nFor example, a page that was published 10 years ago and then updated just a few months ago to include the image you’re searching can appear to be the original source when it’s not.\n\nFinally, make sure you have permission to use the image in the first place (there’s more on copyright law below). If not, you’ll want to reach out to the original source to ask whether you can use the image. \n\nCheck for Image Theft\n\nConducting a reverse image search with one of your images can reveal which websites have used it without your permission.\n\nIf they haven’t received permission, they might be violating your copyright. And you may be able to send a takedown notice.\n\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) empowers copyright owners to send takedown notices to internet service providers (ISPs) when others use their content—including images—online without permission. These ISPs include search engines and social media platforms.\n\nAfter receiving the takedown notice, the ISP is required to disable access to the infringing image (or other content) as soon as possible.\n\nOr, reach out to the website owner directly to discuss a copyright licensing deal.\n\nYou may consider speaking with an intellectual property lawyer to learn more about your legal rights.\n\nReverse Image Search Tools\n\nNeed more advanced reverse image search tools?\n\nTry these platforms.\n\nTinEye\n\nThe TinEye reverse image search engine looks for images similar or identical to an image you provide.\n\nIt offers in-depth results. And also groups results by websites and image collections for easy filtering.\n\nTo use it, navigate to TinEye, and provide the tool with an image. \n\nTinEye will return a list of image matches. And for each result, the tool will provide details like:\n\nWhether the image is a stock photo\nThe image’s URL\nThe image’s file name\nThe date when the tool first discovered the image\n\nTinEye is also available as an extension for browsers like Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.\n\nPixsy\n\nPixsy is a reverse image search engine that helps users monitor and take action against image theft.\n\nTo use it, create an account and import the images you want to monitor. \n\nYou can then click any imported image to view information like the number of image matches found. And their source websites.\n\nClick any image match to get options like:\n\nApproving the image’s use. For example, because the website has licensed the image from you.\nSending a takedown request. Request that the website remove your image.\nReporting the unauthorized image use to Pixsy. Its legal team will review the case and help enforce your legal rights.\nEnhance Your Website with Reverse Image Search\n\nReverse image search is more than a simple technique for getting information on images.\n\nIf you’re a website owner, it’s also a powerful way to:\n\nEnrich your content with images—while providing proper credit\nProtect your images from misuse\nBoost your search rankings—by getting backlinks from your images\n\nPair these efforts with the appropriate tools to more effectively grow your website.\n\nLike Backlink Analytics. Which helps you monitor your website’s backlink profile over time.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign up Now →",
