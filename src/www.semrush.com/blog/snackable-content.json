  "content": "Snackable content is easy to consume, understand, and share.\n\nIn this article, we’ll break down what snackable content is, the different types, and some of its benefits. We’ll also include five tips on how to create your own.\n\nLet’s start.\n\nWhat Is Snackable Content?\n\nSnackable content is easy-to-digest content that’s intended to share an idea quickly and effectively. \n\nUnlike long-form content, snackable content needs to be created so your audience can consume and understand it in a matter of moments. This makes it ideal for sharing on social media.\n\nHere’s an example of how Semrush creates snackable content on LinkedIn:\n\nThe image-driven slides quickly relate to users and make them aware of a Semrush solution that can help them overcome a common problem. \n\nSnackable content can stand on its own or be part of a longer piece of content. Like an infographic within a blog post. \n\nHere’s an example of this in a Backlinko guide:\n\nBesides breaking up a wall of text, the visual helps readers to better visualize your point.\n\nAnd snackable content can also be great for entertaining and providing users with a quick laugh.\n\nIn short, you should make space for it in your content mix.\n\nWhat Are the Different Types of Snackable Content?\n\nHere are five common forms of snackable content and what they’re best for:\n\n1. Memes\n\nThe concept of a meme has been around since the 1970s, when it was defined as a cultural information unit that’s replicated and spread. But we know them today as viral images or videos with text.\n\nMemes are a highly shareable type of content because they’re engaging and entertaining. This is exactly the type of content users are looking for on social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter.\n\nUsers may send the post via DM (direct message), post it to their stories, or tag another user in the comments.\n\nThese images can have a short life span because they tend to rely on pop culture references. \n\nWith memes, you’re participating in a popular movement. And putting your own brand-related spin on it.\n\nHere’s an example of a meme we created for Instagram using screenshots from a well-known reality TV show:\n\nIt relates pop culture (a current TV show) to a common issue (last-minute changes) for a segment of our target audience (social media managers). \n\nMake sure to stay on top of audience research to ensure your brand is creating the right memes at the right times for the right people.\n\n2. GIFs\n\nA GIF is a type of image file (graphics interchange format) that’s usually animated—like a digital flipbook. \n\nGIFs mostly reference memes or moments from TV shows and movies. In content marketing, brands use them to convey emotions and reactions.\n\nThey’re a common type of snackable content because they’re so short and applicable for many different scenarios.\n\nFor example, you’ll see many brands use GIFs on Twitter to convey emotion like this:\n\nGIFs can convey more meaning than plain text, making them ideal for humanizing your social posts.\n\nSometimes, companies use GIFs in long-form content (like blogs) or website landing pages.\n\nFor example, VWO uses GIFs on its homepage to demonstrate how to use its A/B testing tool:\n\nIt helps users understand the tool better than text would.\n\nYou can also incorporate GIFs into your social media engagement strategy when responding to comments. \n\n3. Infographics\n\nInfographics are visualizations used to communicate complex or detailed information at a glance. And more effectively and concisely than text alone.\n\nThey were one of the top three content assets created by marketers in 2022. And they’re not going anywhere.\n\nHere are a few from Gartner illustrating the complex B2B buying journey is:\n\nUsers can glance over the illustrations to understand the key points. \n\nThis content style is also more shareable than a link alone.\n\nAnd infographics can summarize an entire topic or article.\n\nHere’s an example—an infographic summarizing our 10 SEO copywriting tips to improve content:\n\nWhichever type of infographic you create, it should present key information in a visually appealing way.\n\n4. Short Videos\n\nShort-form videos tend to be anything under 60 seconds. \n\nMarketers typically use these videos to increase brand awareness and encourage engagement—especially on social media.\n\nAccording to our State of Content Marketing report, close to half of marketers and business owners say short-form video content performs best:\n\nShort-form videos include FAQs, product demos, customer reviews, event highlight reels, and previews.\n\nFor example, the podcast “This American Life” shares 30-second snippets from its hour-long shows on social media:\n\nThis snackable content makes it easy for users to tag their friends in the comments to help generate interest in the full episodes.\n\nShort videos aren’t just for social media marketing, either. They now appear everywhere brands have a presence.\n\nFor example, you could use one on one of your site’s landing pages to demonstrate a product or service in action. Like Shopify Plus:\n\nThe video provides a quick overview of how the service works for potential customers.\n\nAnd just like infographics, these videos should get the message across quickly to hold your audience’s attention.\n\n5. Interactive Content\n\nInteractive content invites users to complete one or more actions. To encourage engagement. \n\nPolls, games, and quizzes are all interactive snackable content examples.\n\nThey can also help you gather information about your target audiences. \n\nThat way, you can better tailor future snackable content to their preferences.\n\nHere’s a Twitter poll from HubSpot showing what we mean:\n\nThe brand used the poll to spark conversation and lead into a related episode of HubSpot’s podcast where users could learn more.\n\nAnother example of interactive snackable content is Instagram’s question stickers. \n\nHere’s one from Duolingo India encouraging users to share their current streak on the app:\n\nYou can also use interactive content on your website.\n\nHere’s a great example of an image slider from Under Lucky Stars that shows what cities would look like without light pollution:\n\nHaving interactive content like this can inspire, engage, and inform users. And set you apart from the competition.\n\nWhy Use Snackable Content in Your Content Mix?\n\nSnackable content can be made quickly. So you can publish more content in less time.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nBecause our State of Content Marketing report shows that marketers and business owners say publishing content more frequently is key for success.\n\nAnd snackable content works because it:\n\nHelps express your brand’s personality: Content like memes and GIFs reflect your values, sense of humor, and more\nEffectively delivers information: Snackable content is concise and accessible—even on the go\nProvides a better user experience: Different people consume content differently, so snackable content helps to meet certain users’ preferences\n\nPlus, snackable content can be used to drive users to your longer content.\n\nOne isn’t necessarily better than the other. You likely need both for a successful content marketing strategy.\n\nTips for Creating Attention-Grabbing Snackable Content\n\nAn effective snackable content strategy is visual, relatable, optimized for mobile, and data-driven. \n\nWhen you create your own, follow these tips:\n\nCombine Visual Elements with Text in Social Posts\n\nResearchers have said for decades that half of our brains are devoted to vision. But adding text provides another layer of context to help users quickly understand your message. \n\nThis Pinterest guide even suggests using a text overlay to help more people discover your posts.\n\nHere’s an example of how we included additional text with a meme in a tweet to make it relevant to our intended audience (while injecting humor):\n\nQuote graphics are another good option. And can be some of the most shareable content on social media.\n\nSome creators and influencers have built huge followings with them. \n\nHere’s one from poet and illustrator Rupi Kaur:\n\nTip: If you’re going to repost a quote from someone else, make sure they actually said it before you share. Quote Investigator can help.\n\nWhichever style you choose for your visuals, make sure they’re aligned with your brand identity and audience.\n\nPick One Message to Focus On\n\nFocus your snackable content on one clear idea. To make sure people don’t get mixed signals.\n\nTesla did just that in 2014. The company announced a new titanium underbody shield in a post on Medium with GIFs embedded:\n\nJust one GIF makes the message clear: The new underbody drastically improves safety.\n\nUnsure of the kinds of messages your audience relates to? \n\nFind relevant topics your competition is covering using Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool.\n\nEnter your domain and up to four competitor domains you’d like to analyze. Then, click “Compare.”\n\nYou’ll see “Top Opportunities” and a “Keyword Overlap” chart.\n\nTo see keywords your competitors rank for that you don’t, make sure the “Missing” tab is selected in the table at the bottom. \n\nLike this:\n\nThis report can give you ideas for content you’ll want to publish on your website. And translate into snackable content for other channels. \n\nCompare Your Keywords with Competitors’\n\nwith the Keyword Gap Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nRepurpose Content Across Channels \n\nYou can recycle long-form content into snackable content on other channels to preserve resources. And potentially replicate the initial piece’s success.\n\nContent repurposing involves changing the format of one piece of content to create a new piece of content. This could mean creating a video from an article. Or turning the results of a few social polls into an infographic.\n\nLooka repurposed their written guide on choosing a logo font into a snackable YouTube video:\n\nThe brand could even repurpose it further into TikToks or Reels to reach even more audiences.\n\nYou may already have the components of snackable content based on your existing pieces in front of you. That webinar or ebook you shared could be a gold mine for short videos or infographics.\n\nYou could also repurpose:\n\nA blog post into multiple LinkedIn posts\nAn Instagram post into a TikTok video\nA YouTube video into multiple GIFs\nA Twitter poll into an interactive quiz on your website\n\nWhichever format you choose, keep the social media platform or website in mind when you repurpose. And always do a quality check before you publish.\n\nOptimize for Mobile\n\nA lot of people are viewing your snackable content on their smartphones. So, you need to make sure it’s formatted correctly and is easy to view on mobile devices.\n\nThe average mobile user in the U.S. now spends close to five hours a day using their mobile phones.\n\nIf your content is optimized for these users, anything you post will be a lot more shareable and enjoyable to interact with.\n\nHere are four ways to optimize your snackable content for mobile users:\n\nFormat content for scanning. Use plenty of white space, clear typefaces, and contrasting colors.\nTailor the image size to the platform. Upload high-quality graphics in the correct dimensions to make sure they’re not pixelated or badly cropped.\nKeep copy short. Copy for social posts gets truncated on mobile in fewer characters than on desktop, so keep text short.\nCheck that your site works on mobile devices. Use Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test to see how easily mobile visitors can use your website.\n\nTo run the test, enter your domain and click “TEST URL”:\n\nThe results will indicate whether there are any improvements you should make.\n\nLearn from Your Top Performers\n\nAnalyzing performance metrics for your snackable content can help uncover what works best.\n\nMost social media platforms have their own analytics sections to do this. \n\nFor example, you can use account insights on Instagram (if you have a business or creator account) to look at metrics like:\n\nPlays\nAccounts reached\nAccounts engaged\nContent interactions\n\nFrom here, you can see which types of snackable content are performing best. Then make more of the same. Or try variations for those not doing as well.\n\nYou can also use Semrush’s Social Analytics tool to monitor Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram.\n\nTake Facebook, for example. \n\nIn the “Posts” section, you can see your top posts, posts that upset people, and post types.\n\nYou can also filter your top posts by engagement rate, clicks, people, and reactions.\n\nDoing this regularly will help you meet your audiences’ expectations. And avoid wasting time creating content they don’t care about.\n\nStart Creating Snackable Content\n\nWhile snackable content can be used in many places, it should certainly be part of your social media efforts.\n\nNot sure where to start? \n\nCheck out our Social Media Toolkit to see what competitors are doing, find your best-performing posts, and monitor incoming messages. \n\nTrack Your Social Profiles\n\nwith the Social Media Toolkit\n\nTry for Free →",
