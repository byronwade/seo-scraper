Small and medium businesses have just as much to gain from smart partnerships.\n\nDemystifying Brand Partnerships\n\nModern brand partnerships are transforming marketing as we know it. They go beyond just sharing branding or co-promotion to forming creative alliances that tell a story, create unique products, and build deeper connections with audiences.\n\nAccording to a LinkedIn survey, platforms like Instagram and Facebook are goldmines for brands looking to spice up their marketing strategies, with 75% of people turning to social media for shopping tips.\n\nPlus, 69% of consumers trust influencers as much as their best friends when it comes to recommendations, highlighting the impact of influencer partnerships.\n\nTake the partnership between Curology and influencer Hyram Yarbro, for example. This collab allowed Curology to tap into the influencer's audience, likely increasing their visibility and converting followers into customers. \n\nWhat’s exciting now is the speed and flexibility of forming brand partnerships. \n\nThanks to social media, brands can quickly DM relevant influencers and creators to start brainstorming an idea and kick off a collaboration. \n\nFind influencers for your next partnership\n\nwith Influencer Analytics\n\nTry for Free →\nThe Role of Brand Partners\n\nBrand partnerships thrive on clear communication, shared goals, and playing to each other's strengths. \n\nEach potential partner offers something different, whether it’s a unique audience, marketing expertise, or an established customer base, allowing the partnership to benefit your brand in multiple ways.\n\nThe true power of these collaborations lies in combining these strengths to create a competitive advantage that neither could achieve alone. For instance, if you have a great product but a small audience, partnering with someone with a large, engaged following but no product to offer could be the perfect match.\n\nTypes of Brand Partnerships\n\nBrand partnerships come in many forms, each designed to meet specific goals. Choosing the right type can boost a brand’s impact.\n\nHere are a few common types:\n\nCo-Branding Partnerships: Two brands partner to create a new product, like Hershey’s and Betty Crocker, teaming up to make a special brownie mix.\nAffiliate Partnerships: Brands earn commissions by promoting each other’s products through ads like links and banners.\nLicensing Partnerships: A brand allows another to use its intellectual property, such as LEGO producing Star Wars-themed sets under Disney’s license.\nInfluencer Partnerships: Brands partner with social media influencers to market products through authentic content that reaches targeted audiences.\nContent Partnerships: Brands collaborate on content creation to enhance their offerings, such as a travel brand partnering with a popular travel blogger for exclusive content.\nJoint Marketing Campaigns: Brands from non-competing sectors come together to co-market complementary products or services, like a gym and a health food store offering discounts to each other’s customers.\n\nTo see these concepts in action, let's explore a few brand partnership examples that showcase the power of well-executed collaborations.\n\nSuccessful Brand Partnerships That Made an Impact\n\nIt's easier than ever for brands to collaborate and turn creative concepts into tangible success. The following examples showcase how different brands have leveraged partnerships to enhance their market presence and achieve remarkable outcomes. \n\nLiquid Death’ Bold Collaborations\n\nLiquid Death has disrupted the beverage industry with its bold and unconventional approach to marketing water. \n\nOne of their strategies?

The collab worked as Liquid Death worked with e.l.f. Cosmetics to create a themed makeup collection labeled Corpse Paint. This surprising collaboration between a water brand and a cosmetics company proved successful, blending their distinct products into something uniquely appealing.\n\nSource: Liquid Death\n\nLiquid Death is redefining marketing with a strategy that’s enjoyable and entertaining. And it's paying off, as evidenced by its unprecedented growth. \n\nVisit Seattle and The Walking Dead\n\nVisit Seattle partnered with The Walking Dead in a notable brand collaboration. This partnership involved Seattle native Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who plays Negan on the show.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nBy merging travel with popular culture and leveraging celebrity influence from Jeffrey Dean Morgan, this partnership captivated a diverse audience and enhanced Seattle's image as an exciting destination. \n\nAbsolut + OceanSpray Co-Branded Products\n\nIn 2022, Absolut Vodka and Ocean Spray announced a brand partnership, bringing together two category leaders in the beverage industry.\n\nSource: Absolut\n\nThis collaboration shows that the brands understand consumer preferences by merging two products that were already frequently enjoyed together: vodka and cranberry juice. \n\nThis alliance also broadens its customer base and enhances brand visibility, effectively tapping into the growing market for ready-to-drink beverages.\n\nDove, Nike, and the Body Confident Sport Initiative\n\nDove, known for its commitment to body positivity, and Nike, a leader in athletic wear, have come together to launch the Body Confident Sport Initiative. \n\nSource: Instagram\n\nThis campaign encourages young girls to engage in sports by promoting body confidence and inclusivity in athletic environments.\n\nSince the products from the two brands don’t directly compete, it was a smart way for both brands to partner between industries and reach a wider audience with a positive message.\n\nThe Dove and Nike brand partnership thrives by harmonizing their missions to empower young people and foster a positive self-image. \n\nThe combination broadens each brand’s outreach, promoting diversity and improving engagement with audiences who value inclusivity in sports and personal care.\n\nNow, let’s explore how you can launch your own brand partnership to tap into similar benefits and opportunities.\n\nHow Small and Medium Businesses Can Find Potential Brand Partners\n\nBrand partnerships offer a fantastic way for small and medium businesses to expand their reach.

Gaining a clear picture of who your audience is will help you identify brands or influencers that align with their interests and needs.\n\nHere are some other practical tips to inspire your collaborative efforts.\n\nStrategy\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nNetwork and Find Complementary Partners\n\n\t\n\nAttend local business events to connect with businesses whose products or services enhance your own.\n\n\t\n\nA bakery meets a coffee roaster at a food industry event, leading to a co-branded café experience.\n\n\n\n\nLeverage Local and Industry Trends\n\n\t\n\nIdentify partnership opportunities that align with current community or industry trends.\n\n\t\n\nAn eco-friendly store partners with local environmental initiatives.\n\n\n\n\nUse Social Media and Influencers\n\n\t\n\nAmplify your reach quickly by partnering with influencers who can introduce your brand to new audiences.\n\n\t\n\nA boutique collaborates with a fashion influencer during a sale.\n\n\n\n\nEngage with Your Customer Base\n\n\t\n\nSurvey your customers to understand what other products or services they use alongside yours.\n\n\t\n\nA pet grooming service discovers clients are interested in dog training, leading to a partnership with a local trainer.\n\n\n\n\nExplore Cross-Industry Opportunities\n\n\t\n\nLook beyond your immediate industry for unexpected but valuable partnerships.\n\n\t\n\nA local gym partners with a nearby healthy meal prep service to offer fitness and nutrition packages.\n\n\n\n\nLeverage an Influencer Database/Research Tool\n\n\t\n\nSearch through a database to find influencers that are looking to partner with brands like yours. \n\n\t\n\nAn online hiking shoe brand finds a list of hiking and camping influencers to partner with for a promotion of their new product.\n\nTools to Discover Brand Partners\n\nNavigating the world of brand partnerships doesn't have to be complex. Apps like Influencer Analytics and Audience Intelligence can simplify the search for ideal partners, making it easier to connect with those who align with your brand’s values and goals.\n\nInfluencer Analytics\n\nInfluencer Analytics is an app that lets you find influencers and manage your entire influencer marketing campaign cycle in one place. \n\nOne of the standout features is that you don’t need a well-established brand to connect with influencers. Instead, you can easily filter influencers by category to find the perfect match for your campaign.\n\nYou can find influencers in a few different ways.\n\nIn the “Influencer Discovery” tab, search for influencers on YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, or TikTok. \n\nOnce you choose a platform, you can use various filter combinations to search for influencers by various criteria. \n\nFor example, the influencer’s category, country, audience size, and many others.\n\nOr, if you don’t know where to start with the filters, you can use the AI-powered search feature to find influencers by describing what you're looking for in simple words (this feature can also be found on the home page). \n\nSimply enter your specific details in the text box and click “Create magic.”\n\nAfter you click “Create magic,” the app will return a list of matching influencers. You can click on an influencer to view their profile. \n\nHere, you'll find valuable details such as publication frequency, view and subscriber statistics, estimated advertising costs, and more.\n\nAs you explore potential brand partnerships, you can save searches, create lists, and export them as needed.\n\nTo manage your campaigns, go to the “Campaign Management” tab, where you can run influencer campaigns from start to finish, monitor real-time performance, and evaluate the results.\n\nNote: The Campaign Management feature is available as an in-app add-on feature for $69/month.\n\nAudience Intelligence\n\nThe Audience Intelligence app helps you understand audiences on a deeper level by analyzing the demographics and psychographics of a brand or influencer’s followers. \n\nIt uncovers their interests, habits, and the creators they engage with, making it easy to find influencers and potential brand partnerships that align with your goals.\n\nTo get started, name the report, enter the desired brand or influencer’s X handle, and click “Create New Report.”\n\nThe app will generate an overview of the brand’s audience.\n\nFor more detailed information on interests, demographics, audience segments, etc., click on any section in the report.\n \n\nFor potential brand partnerships, check out the \"Top Brands\" or \"Top Influencers\" sections. \n\nThese will show you the most relevant brands and influencers your audience follows, helping you identify potential partners who align with your audience’s preferences. \n\nYou can also apply filters to narrow down the data by specific criteria, like country, language, or audience size.\n\nThe “Affinity” score tells you how much overlap exists between the two audiences. A higher affinity % could show you which potential partners might make the most sense. \n\nUse the menu at the top to drill down into specific areas. \n\nFor example, use the \"Interests\" and \"Media Affinity\" tabs to see what content and channels your audience engages with the most. This will guide you in choosing partners your audience already trusts.\n\nOnce you've identified relevant influencers or brands, you can reach out to explore partnership opportunities based on shared audience interests and values.\n\nCrafting a Brand Partnership Pitch\n\nReady to approach potential brand partners?\n\nHere's how you can make your first moves toward building meaningful collaborations that amplify your brand's voice and reach.\n\n1. Craft a Personalized Message\n\nAvoid generic pitches. Tailor your message to show genuine interest in the influencer or brand. Highlight how your values align and how a partnership could benefit both parties.\n\n2. Be Clear About the Value\n\nExplain how the partnership benefits them. Whether it’s increased visibility, access to a new audience, or shared content creation, make sure they see the upside for their brand or platform.\n\n3. Address Potential Concerns\n\nPartners may worry about fit, ROI, or brand reputation. Address these concerns head-on by outlining your shared goals and emphasizing the benefits of working together.\n\n4. End with a Clear Call to Action\n\nMake it easy for them to take the next step. Suggest a time for a call, or ask if they’re open to discussing further details.\n\nMaximize Your Reach with Brand Collaborations\n\nBrand partnerships are more than just a marketing tactic; they're a strategic way to scale your reach and impact. \n\nBy leveraging these collaborations, SMBs and marketers can unlock new audiences and fresh opportunities.\n\nEager to find your perfect brand partner? \n\nExplore our Influencer Analytics and Audience Intelligence tools to kickstart your partnership journey.
