  "content": "Bard is Google’s new AI experiment. But does it live up to popular OpenAI rival ChatGPT?\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn what Google Bard is and how it works. We’ll also show you how to get more helpful answers when you use it.\n\nWhat Is Google Bard?\n\nBard is a free experimental AI chatbot created by Google. \n\nIt analyzes information from the web. Then uses what it finds to talk to users and answer questions.\n\nGoogle designed it as a complementary experience to Search rather than a replacement. Users can visit Google’s search engine from within Bard's interface to explore responses further.\n\nUnlike a search engine that relies on keywords, Bard can process natural language queries.\n\nThese are queries written like humans speak. For example:\n\nGoogle developed Bard to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing Chat (which was built using GPT technology).\n\nGoogle released Bard on March 21, 2023—inviting users to a waitlist. They also invited a small percentage to be Google Bard Beta testers.\n\nOn May 10, Google removed the waitlist. Bard is now available in over 200 countries and territories around the world.\n\nHow Does Google Bard Work?\n\nGoogle Bard is a generative AI chatbot.\n\nA chatbot is software that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to understand human language and simulate a conversation with users. The term generative means it can create its own original content.\n\nIt analyzes a user request then works to identify the input’s intent. It then composes a relevant reply.\n\nChatbots use a branch of computer science called natural language processing (NLP). \n\nNLP examines the context of words in order to understand their meaning. Then produces a relevant response based on the command it’s given.\n\nBard also uses a large language model (LLM) to make its responses more human-like.\n\nAn LLM is a smart computer program trained to understand and generate human language. It’s trained by analyzing huge amounts of text and data, such as documents, books, websites, and news articles. \n\nThe LLM uses this analysis to find patterns and predict which words will likely come next in a series. This is how it carries out tasks like answering questions and following instructions. \n\nBard began with an LLM called Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA for short). Google later upgraded it to Pathways Language Model (PaLM).\n\nAt Google I/O 2023, CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company was upgrading Bard’s LLM to PaLM 2. Google has trained PaLM 2 in over 100 languages. \n\nThis upgrade improved Bard’s logic, reasoning, math, and coding capabilities.\n\nWhat Can Google Bard Do?\n\nBard has plenty of uses for business and marketing purposes. \n\nYou can use Bard to:\n\nAnswer questions\nGenerate content\nProvide tips and ideas\nSummarize text and data\nChange the tone of your writing\nTranslate language\nSolve math problems\nWrite code\n\nFor example, these are tips it came up with for first-time anglers:\n\nWhile the tips are basic, the quality of the answer relies on the detail in your prompt. (More on that soon.)\n\nLet’s look at how Bard can help you generate content. Here’s part of Bard’s answer when asked for a blog outline about tips for new content marketers:\n\nAgain, the prompt didn’t add much detail. So Bard gave a generic answer.\n\nBut when asked for unconventional tips, it provided a more in-depth response:\n\nThese are more unique and specific. We can refine them further by asking for more options in a follow-up prompt.\n\nBard will also remember all its previous prompts and answers in your chat. It will customize future responses based on that information.\n\nSourcing is a feature Bard offers that other popular chatbots are missing.\n\nBard includes links to sources and citations when it uses quotes or images in answers:\n\nShowing where information comes from helps validate responses, which is critical in the age of misinformation.\n\nBard also continues to add functionality as it evolves. Its latest update introduced several more new features:\n\nVisual search (powered by Google Lens)\nSupport for new languages (Japanese and Korean)\nThe ability to create test cases and update APIs\n\nBard also plans to release an AI-powered image generator called Adobe Firefly:\n\nImage Source: Adobe Blog\n\nGoogle and Adobe teamed up to create Firefly to compete with OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, another AI text-to-image generator.\n\nIt will generate images and allow you to upload your image with Express, Adobe’s all-in-one content creation tool.\n\nGoogle Bard vs. ChatGPT\n\nBard and ChatGPT are both chatbots that use NLP and LLMs. They are similar but here are the key differences between them:\n\nLet’s look at a few of these differences in detail.\n\nInformation Sourcing\n\nChatGPT was trained on online content up to September 2021. It can’t search for current information from the internet, so its information is limited to that cutoff date.\n\nBard refers to the whole internet for real-time answers.\n\nBecause of its source limit, ChatGPT isn’t even aware of Bard’s release:\n\nFree and Paid Plans\n\nGoogle Bard is a free service. ChatGPT has both free and paid tiers.\n\nChatGPT-3.5, the free version of the chatbot, has an unlimited question cap. But if your prompts are complex, you may get lower-quality answers.\n\nThe paid version, ChatGPT-4 has a cap of 50 questions per four-hour period. But it’s trained with a more advanced LLM, so it provides more informative and accurate answers.\n\nRestrictions on Technology\n\nGoogle Bard is currently available in 230 countries and territories without restriction. \n\nChatGPT, however, has been subject to bans in several countries:\n\nA temporary ban in Italy over data privacy concerns\nBans in North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and Syria due to internet censorship\n\nMore legislation is in the works around AI in the US and elsewhere.\n\nWhat Are Google Bard’s Limitations?\n\nGoogle continues to remind users that Bard is currently an experiment. They use this term in their content and branding related to Bard.\n\nBard also warns users of the potential for inaccurate or offensive information in responses underneath the prompt box.\n\nWhile the technology behind Bard is always improving, here are some of its main limitations: \n\nBiases: Bard’s self-learning means it absorbs the views and opinions of those who created the content it’s trained on\nContext confusion: Bard can oversimplify complex discussions (e.g., a description of the theory of relativity) or misunderstand context (e.g., if asked about “the meaning of life,” it might not know whether to define the word or give a philosophical answer)\nInaccurate answers: Google recommends double-checking Bard’s accuracy using Search\nOngoing development: Because the technology is always evolving, it’s prone to bugs and glitches\n\nLet’s look at examples of two of these limitations.\n\nBiases\n\nWhen it comes to biases, Google is working on emphasizing safety and responsible AI with Bard. They train it not to produce outputs that reinforce stereotypes or slurs, have violent or gory content, or contain profanity.\n\nHowever, UK nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that those objectives weren’t always effective. \n\nIt tested the chatbot on 100 false narratives centered on nine divisive themes like vaccines, conspiracies, and sexism.\n\nBard performed well when asked simple questions about these topics, usually disagreeing with untrue statements or refusing to respond.\n\nHowever, its safety features frequently failed when the CCDH gave it more complex prompts. For instance, by asking it to take on the role of a character and create content from that perspective. \n\nIn these cases, it occasionally generated false information or statements that supported harmful stereotypes. Or incorporated inflammatory hashtags for social media posts on a politically divisive topic.\n\nIn 78 out of 100 topics, the chatbot conveyed false (and potentially harmful) opinions.\n\nThese are the results of only one study, but they show you shouldn’t take Bard’s responses at face value. It’s also important to remember Google still defines Bard’s answers as “experimental.”\n\nInaccurate Answers\n\nWhen Google launched Bard, the chatbot made an embarrassing public error in its first demo. \n\nBard was asked, “What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9-year-old about?”\n\nImage Source: Google via X\n\nIts response seems informative. However, “took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system,” was untrue.\n\nSeveral astronomers on Twitter debunked the statement. \n\nNASA’s website even confirms the Very Large Telescope (VLT) took the first image of an exoplanet in 2004. \n\nGoogle is always refining Bard’s training to prevent incorrect answers. But they still recommend fact-checking Bard’s answers using Search.\n\nHow to Access Google Bard\n\nTo access Bard, head to bard.google.com. You must be 18+ years old and have a personal Google account in an approved country to use Bard.\n\nOnce you're signed in, click Try Bard on the landing page.\n\nRead through the terms and privacy conditions. Then click “I agree.”\n\nYou’ll see a pop-up with a reminder that Bard is an experiment. You can also opt in or out to receive emails about Bard’s improvements here.\n\nClick Continue.\n\nThe next screen will be the chat interface where you can type in your first prompt.\n\nThere isn’t a dedicated mobile app yet. But you can access Bard on any mobile browser.\n\n6 Tips to Get the Most Helpful Answers from Google Bard\n\nFor the best answers, provide context with your prompts. And specify the format and level of detail you expect Bard to respond with.\n\nBelow are strategies to get more useful, accurate answers from Bard.\n\n1. Specify Your Audience and Give Bard a Role\n\nOne of the most popular strategies to get helpful answers is to specify the audience Bard is writing for. \n\nYou can also give Bard a role to play to give it an idea of the context you want. \n\nFor example, we told Bard it was a financial advisor. Then we asked it a question about mortgages for first-time buyers:\n\nSpecifying first-time buyers as the audience added context to keep the tips relevant and simple. It also prompted Bard to provide information on programs specifically for first-time homebuyers.\n\n2. Use Target Numbers To Specify How Much Detail You Want\n\nLet’s say a response is too broad.\n\nYou can add numbers to prompt Bard on the amount of detail you’re looking for.\n\nFor example, we asked Bard for seven tips for first-time homebuyers:\n\nAsking for a specific number laid out the answer in seven simple points.\n\n3. Narrow Down the Format You’d Like\n\nAsking for a specific format can also get you closer to the style of answer you want and make it instantly usable.\n\nYou can ask for formats like:\n\nTables with any number of rows or columns and different headings, borders, and styles\nChecklists with formatting (e.g., headings, subheadings, bullet points, or numbering)\nCode like syntax highlighting, line numbers, and indentation\n\nBard defaults to bulleted lists most of the time.\n\nBut here, we asked for a simplified checklist with boxes to tick:\n\nYou could plug this copy directly into a form you’re creating as a checklist for readers.\n\nIf you ask Bard to make a table, it also gives you the option to export the data to a Google Sheet:\n\n4. Provide the Beginning of a Piece of Text\n\nInstead of asking Bard to generate an entire piece of content, you can ask it to finish a section you’ve started:\n\nThis helps the tool match the tone you want, since it has something to work from. It can also aid in making sure Bard gets the correct context, which can improve its accuracy.\n\n5. Ask Follow-Up Questions \n\nOutput from your first prompt not hitting the mark? Give Bard a follow-up prompt to get more detail.\n\nIn this response, Bard took its earlier output about first-time homebuyer tips and went into more detail on a few of them. It also revised its tone to be more upbeat and even added a bit of encouragement at the end.\n\n6. Double Check Output with Google Search \n\nIf you’re asking Bard for factual information, double check every answer using Search. \n\nBard makes it easy with a Google it button at the bottom of each answer.\n\nCombine Bard with Other AI Tools to Up Your Game\n\nBard combines the technology of AI with the power of Google. It’s not perfect, but it has several advantages over comparable technologies like ChatGPT.\n\nBut Bard and ChatGPT aren’t the only AI tools available. \n\nMany companies are trying their hand at adding AI to existing tools, or creating new ones altogether. \n\nIf you want to power up your content creation process with AI, check out these Semrush tools:\n\nRephraser Tool: See what parts of your copy can be improved and rewrite them with our AI paraphrasing tool\nContentShake: Automate your entire content creation strategy, including content ideas and outlines all backed by Semrush data\n\nIf you’re ready to see all the options out there, check out our list of Best AI Tools for Digital Marketers.",
