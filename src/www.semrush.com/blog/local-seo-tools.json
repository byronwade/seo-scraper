The tool will monitor your ranking in each one.\n\nFinally, decide whether to scan manually or set up a scanning schedule.\n\nWhen setup is complete, you’ll see the result of your first scan.\n\nEach number represents your ranking position for the given keyword and search location. (You can change your keyword selection using the drop-down menu at the top.)\n\nIdeally, you want to be in position one. Because that means searchers are more likely to see your result—and engage with it.\n\nYou can analyze your main competitors in any search location by clicking the numbered circle.\n\nMake sure to monitor your average rank and share of voice over time. So you can check they’re moving in the right direction.\n\nFor advice for improving your listing’s rankings, read our Google Maps marketing guide.\n\nTip\n\nUse the Map Rank Tracker in combination with the Position Tracking tool to understand how your Business Profile and website perform in search results.

Just set up your free account to get 50 credits to use on one campaign (i.e., one business location).\n\nCredit usage is based on the number of pins and keywords scanned. For example, if you scan a 7x7 map for 10 keywords four times per month, it’ll cost (7 x 7 x 10 x 4 =) 1,960 credits per month.\n\nTo access more credits, you’ll need one of the following plans:\n\nSemrush Local Premium Plan: This costs $40 per month and gives you 2,500 credits per month.

Keyword Magic Tool by Semrush\n\nSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool is a must-have for local keyword research. \n\nUse it to discover search terms people use to find businesses like yours. So you can optimize your business listings and website more effectively.\n\nTo get started, enter a seed keyword to base your research around. (This should be a simple term related to your business—e.g., “restaurant.”)\n\nThen, choose your country and click “Search.”\n\nNext, go to the “Include keywords” menu. And add location-specific terms your prospective customers might use (e.g., the name of your city and district).\n\nInclude general terms “near,” “nearby,” and “local,” too. \n\nWhen you’re done, select “Any keywords” and click “Apply.”\n\nYou’ll now see a list of keywords that contain your seed keyword (or a close variation) and one or more of your location-specific terms.\n\nFor example, “italian restaurants near me”: \n\nThe tool also provides lots of useful data, including:\n\nVolume: The keyword search volume, or average number of monthly searches\nKD %: The keyword difficulty score, which measures how hard it’ll be to rank highly in the organic (unpaid) results\nSF: The number of SERP features (non-standard elements on the search engine results page, or SERP)—click the number to see which ones they are\n\nWhen you find keywords that are relevant to your business, use the check boxes and “+ Add to keyword list” button to save them to the Keyword Strategy Builder.\n\nThen, repeat the process with other seed keywords. So you can discover all the different ways that prospective customers search.\n\nTip\n\nNaturally incorporating keywords into your business listings and website can help you rank higher in search results. For detailed advice, read our keyword optimization guide.\n\nPricing\n\nCreate your free Semrush account to try the Keyword Magic Tool. You can conduct up to 10 searches per day and get up to 10 results for each.\n\nOr start your free Semrush trial to unlock higher limits. Your trial will also give you access to dozens of other digital marketing tools. \n\nCheck out our pricing page to learn more about our plans.\n\n5. Position Tracking by Semrush\n\nSemrush’s Position Tracking tool lets you monitor your website’s Google rankings in specific search locations.\n\nDuring the setup process, choose your target country, state/region, city, or zip code. (Many local businesses compete at the city level. So, this is a good place to start.)\n\nAnd add the name attached to your Google Business Profile. So the tool can check for its appearance in search results.\n\nNext, add your local keywords.\n\n(If you already saved keywords in the Keyword Strategy Builder, you can send them over later.)\n\nOnce setup is complete, go to the “Overview” report.\n\nThe “Visibility” graph gives an overview of your organic performance: \n\nA score of 100% means your website ranks in the top unpaid position for all tracked keywords. While a score of 0% means you don’t appear in the top 100 for any of your keywords.\n\nScroll down to see a full keyword breakdown.\n\nThe “Pos.” columns show your website’s ranking position(s) on the specified dates.\n\nIf you see an icon, that means you rank(ed) for a SERP feature. The one that looks like a map pin means your Business Profile appears in the local pack (the section with a map).\n\nFor example, this site ranks in the top organic position and the local pack:\n\nHere’s what that looks like on the results page:\n\nMake sure to identify any underperforming keywords. And adjust your local SEO strategy to suit.\n\nAlso sign up for ranking alerts. So you can act quickly should your rankings drop in the future.\n\nTip\n\nIf you advertise on Google, you can also use Position Tracking to monitor your paid search ad rankings. Just click the cog icon then select “Google Ads.”\n \n\nPricing\n\nCreate your free Semrush account to track up to 10 keywords in the Position Tracking tool. \n\nOr start your free Semrush trial to unlock higher limits. Your trial will also give you access to dozens of other digital marketing tools. \n\nCheck out our pricing page to learn more about our plans.\n\nTrack Your Rankings\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n6.

And helps Google match your profile with relevant search queries. \n\nOnce all that’s done, focus on getting Google reviews from happy customers.\n\nThe quantity and quality of reviews on your profile can significantly affect your Business Profile’s rankings.\n\nAnd the content of the reviews you get can help you rank for more relevant search queries.\n\nFor example, if a lot of reviews mention one of your menu items (e.g., vegan chicken), then your Business Profile can rank for related search terms.\n\nAlso consider posting on Google My Business.

Google Analytics 4\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 (GA4) collects data about the users who visit your website. \n\nIt helps you measure the success of your local SEO strategy. And wider marketing efforts.\n\nFor example, the “Traffic acquisition” report shows where your website visitors come from. \n\nYou can see how traffic from organic search (unpaid search engine results) compares to traffic from other channels.\n\nIf you use UTM codes, you can also analyze traffic from specific links (e.g., the website link in your Google Business Profile).\n\nIn the “Events” section, you can monitor and compare conversion metrics.\n\nFor instance, you can see whether organic search visitors are more likely to:\n\nClick your phone number\nBook an appointment\nUse your store locator\n\nGoogle will track some events automatically.
