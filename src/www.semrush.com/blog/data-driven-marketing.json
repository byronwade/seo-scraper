  "content": "What Is Data-Driven Marketing?\n\nData-driven marketing is the process of gathering and using data to inform marketing decisions and personalize the customer experience. This data often revolves around consumer demographics and behaviors, enabling marketers to reach the right people, in the right place, at the right time.\n\nHere are some examples of data-driven marketing:\n\nTargeting digital ads based on your past customers’ demographics\nUsing insights from paid search campaigns to guide your SEO strategy\nCreating personalized content from user data (e.g., Spotify Wrapped)\nEmailing customers about products they’ve left in their online carts\n\nSome of the most common data sources include:\n\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) platforms, like Salesforce\nAudience research tools, like One2Target\nMarket research tools, like Market Explorer\nCompetitive intelligence tools, like Traffic Analytics\nWebsite analytics tools, like Google Analytics\nEmail marketing platforms, like Mailchimp\nSocial media platforms, like Instagram\n\nMarketers can also conduct their own surveys and experiments to yield useful data.\n\nData-Driven Marketing vs. Traditional Marketing\n\nTraditional marketing is any marketing activity that isn’t online. This means there are significant limitations to the analytical data marketers can collect and the ways they can use it.\n\nWhile it’s possible to gather useful data (e.g., through focus groups), it’s usually:\n\nRelatively small in scope\nStatic\nDifficult, slow, and expensive to collect\n\nThis means traditional marketers must often rely on past experiences and intuitions when making decisions. Because they don’t have data to guide them.\n\nOn the other hand, data-driven marketing utilizes digital technologies that enable:\n\nLarge-scale data collection and analysis\nReal-time data monitoring\nData-based automations\n\nAll of this helps to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve results.\n\nFor example, traditional marketers can’t determine the exact demographics of people who listened to their radio ad. Or see what percentage of people visited their website after hearing it.\n\nBut digital marketers can track the demographics of people viewing their online ads. And adapt their campaign based on performance metrics, like the number of sales generated.\n\nThe Benefits of Data-Driven Marketing\n\nUsing data in marketing can help teams make better decisions—and make them more quickly.\n\nLet’s explore the main benefits of data-driven marketing:\n\nEnhanced Customer Targeting and Segmentation\n\nGathering and analyzing data about customers gives you a better understanding of who they truly are. And who’s likely to buy from you in the future (i.e., your target audience).\n\nThe key thing is segmenting your market, or defining key types of customers. That way, you can:\n\nCreate highly tailored marketing materials that drive better results\nReduce distribution costs by targeting smaller groups of people\nFine-tune your brand image to align with each segment’s values\n\nFor example, without access to relevant data, Lego marketers might have assumed all its end users were children. And conducted their marketing accordingly.\n\nInstead, they discovered that their adult audience was growing and adapted their marketing strategy, Campaign reports.\n\nIn October 2023, Lego spent over $900K on its “Adults Welcome” digital ad campaign in the U.S. According to the AdClarity app.\n\nLego also publishes website content aimed specifically at this audience segment. And focuses on their specific needs—e.g., the desire to relax rather than play with Lego toys. \n\nTo make sure you’re not missing an important demographic, use Semrush’s One2Target tool.\n\nEnter the domains of up to 100 competitors and the tool will provide an audience breakdown.\n\nThe “Demographics” report covers age, gender, and location data.\n\nThe “Socioeconomics” report contains charts for household size, household income, employment status, and education level.\n\nAnd the “Behavior” report covers social media platforms, interests, and device types.\n\nTip\n\nCreate a buyer persona (fictional customer profile) to represent each audience segment. Semrush’s Persona tool takes you through the process step by step.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ Audiences\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nImproved Personalization and User Experience\n\nData-driven marketing enables marketers to deliver messages based on individual needs, preferences, and behaviors. And make their communications feel more human.\n\nFor example, graphic design tool Canva asks users to provide their name during signup. So they can send personalized emails.\n\nThe tool also asks users what they’ll use the platform for.\n\nThat way, they can provide suggestions and support based on the user’s most likely needs.\n\nThis approach creates a better user experience. Which can lead to more upsells and improved customer loyalty.\n\nMore Effective Resource Allocation\n\nAs part of a data-driven marketing strategy, you should track marketing KPIs (key performance indicators). So you can see what’s working and allocate future resources accordingly.\n\nHere are some of the metrics you can track and act upon:\n\nSEO metrics (e.g., organic traffic, keyword rankings)\nSocial media metrics (e.g., followers, engagement rate)\nEmail marketing metrics (e.g., open rate, click-through rate)\nContent marketing metrics (e.g., time on page, conversion rate)\nWebsite engagement metrics (e.g., bounce rate, average session duration)\nAdvertising metrics (e.g., return on ad spend, cost per click)\n\nWhere possible, use A/B testing (also known as split testing). This allows you to compare two options under similar circumstances and see which performs best.\n\nFor example, we used the SplitSignal app to see which title tags get more clicks in search results: those with the brand name at the front or those with the brand name at the end.\n\nWe found that front-loading the brand name reduced clicks by 6.7%. So, it’s generally not a good idea.\n\nStreamlined Decision-Making\n\nData-driven marketing streamlines decision-making because it provides concrete reasoning for a specific approach.\n\nThere’s less need for stakeholders to hash out opinions and ideas. They can simply agree to go where the data takes them.\n\nFor instance, it’s hard to argue that one marketing channel is better than another if your sales numbers say otherwise.\n\nTo ensure effective communication, create clear marketing reports with key data and takeaways for stakeholders.\n\nHead to My Reports in Semrush to create automated reports that look like this:\n\nYou can insert data from Semrush, Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and other sources.\n\nThe Challenges in Data-Driven Marketing\n\nLet’s explore the main challenges in data-driven marketing and how to overcome them:\n\nCollecting and Analyzing Data\n\nCollecting and analyzing data is easier than ever. But it can still be a daunting process.\n\nAfter all, there are so many tools and metrics to choose from.\n\nHere are some quick tips for success:\n\nInvest in user-friendly, reliable, and multifunctional tools\nIncorporate data into your marketing strategy one area at a time\nBuild analytics dashboards that allow you to focus on the most important metrics\n\nIf you don’t have your own data to work with, perform competitive research. To see what’s working well for your closest rivals.\n\nFor example, Semrush’s Traffic Analytics tool provides metrics like pages per visit, average visit duration, and bounce rate. \n\nYou can also see which channels drive the most traffic. And much more.\n\nPerform Competitive Research\n\nWith Traffic Analytics\n\nSign Up for FREE →\nLack of Data Literacy\n\nData literacy is the ability to understand and act upon data effectively.\n\nIf anyone in your team lacks data literacy skills, it can lead to poor decision-making.\n\nHere are a few ways to overcome this issue:\n\nInvest in data analysis training for your staff\nChoose tools that provide clear results and takeaways\nRegularly review outcomes and investigate any issues\nUse automations to reduce the risk of error\nData Compliance\n\nIt’s crucial to collect, store, and use data responsibly. In many regions, there are data protection laws to follow. \n\nFor example: \n\nEU: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nCalifornia, U.S.: California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\nU.K.: The Data Protection Act 2018\nCanada: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)\nBrazil: Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD)\n\nBefore adopting a data-driven marketing strategy, determine which regulations apply to your business. And establish clear policies for your team to follow.\n\nHow to Do Data-Driven Marketing\n\nHere are the basic steps involved in data-driven marketing:\n\nSet goals. Define what you want to achieve with your marketing.\nCollect data. Gather relevant data from reliable sources.\nAnalyze data. Look for insights and patterns in the data.\nDevelop a strategy. Create a marketing plan based on your data analysis.\nLaunch campaigns. Implement your marketing activities.\nMeasure performance. Track the results of your marketing campaigns.\nOptimize. Adjust your strategy based on what the data shows works best. \nData-Driven Marketing Case Study\n\nTo better illustrate how data-driven marketing works, let’s explore the LiberEat x Semrush case study.\n\nLiberEat, which offers technology for food businesses, decided that advertising wasn't sustainable for long-term user acquisition.\n\nSo, they used Semrush’s Market Explorer tool to find out how competitors got their traffic. And discovered that organic search played a significant role.\n\nHere’s an example of what the graph might’ve looked like:\n\nThis drove the company to investigate their competitors’ Google rankings. With the Organic Research tool.\n\nThis acted as the springboard for further keyword research. Which allowed the company to identify relevant keywords with high business potential.\n\nFor example, they avoided search terms with a keyword difficulty score (KD %) above 50. Because they knew it’d be difficult for their relatively young site to rank for them.\n\nThey could then prioritize their keywords based on factors like relevancy and the average number of monthly searches. And start creating content.\n\nWithout access to this kind of data, marketing teams would be left guessing which channels to focus on. And which keywords to pursue.\n\nStart Gathering Insights for Your Data-Driven Marketing Strategy\n\nWith a Semrush .Trends subscription, you can gather valuable data-driven marketing insights:\n\nLearn about audience demographics, socioeconomics, and behavior\nReveal your competitors’ top marketing channels\nSee where your business fits into the wider market\n\nGather Valuable Insights\n\nwith Semrush .Trends\n\nTry for Free →",
