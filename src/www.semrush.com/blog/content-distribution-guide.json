  "content": "As BuzzFeed’s Jonathan Perelman once said, “Content is king, but distribution is queen. And she wears the pants.”\n\nIn the world of content marketing, this is indeed true—building a smart content distribution strategy is crucial for long-term success. If you produce a remarkable piece of content, how can it make an impact if nobody reads it?\n\nIn this article, we'll guide you through developing a content distribution strategy and effectively promoting your content to maximize reach and attract loyalty to your brand. \n\nWhat Is Content Distribution?\n\nContent distribution is the process of publishing and promoting your content through various channels and media formats.\n\nThis can include your website, ads, your social media channels, email newsletters, and other channels we’ll explore in a moment. \n\nBut to start, we’ll discuss the importance of content distribution and why you should care about this strategy in the first place.\n\nWhy Is Content Distribution Important?\n\nWithout an effective means to share, amplify, and promote your content to the world, it’s unlikely to reach new audiences.\n\nThink of it this way: Would you have ever heard of or read the books of favorite authors if they didn’t have a company to publish, ship, and sell their works at your local bookstore?\n\nProbably not. Unless your brand is already widely known, it’s nearly impossible to reach your intended audience and get in front of people who’ve never heard of you before.\n\nIn other words, content distribution helps you get your content in front of the right audience via the right channel and at the right time.\n\nTypes of Content You Can Distribute \n\nBefore evaluating the content distribution platforms, consider all the content assets you already have. This can include:\n\nBlog posts\nWhite papers and guides \nResearch studies\nPillar pages, research, and other long-reads (e.g., how-to guides)\nCase studies and success stories\nInfographics \nChecklists\nEbooks and templates\nArticles (non-blog posts)\nProduct landing pages\nVideos\nPodcast episodes\nNewsletters \n\nPick your promotional channels wisely. A good rule of thumb is to define your expectations as goals and key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nFor example, if you want to increase brand awareness, you can focus on shares, organic traffic, keyword rankings, and backlinks. \n\nThree Kinds of Distribution Channels To Focus On\n\nContent distribution channels are the platforms and media where you share your content. \n\nSpecific channels may vary depending on your resources and audience specifics. In general, though, we can divide them into three broad categories:\n\nOwned Channels\n\nOwned channels are the content platforms and channels that belong to your company or brand. \n\nThis could include:\n\nBlogs\nGated content\nLanding pages\nSocial media profiles\nNewsletters\nMobile apps\n\nHere’s an example of an owned channel, a blog found on a dog training website:\n\nEarned or Shared Channels\n\nEarned or shared channels are those that belong to external third parties who have shared content about your brand. Think of bloggers, social media influencers, journalists, or review sites.\n\nWhile posting your content on these sites is free, you don’t own the content.\n\nExamples include:\n\nShares\nMentions\nReviews\nGuest posts\n\nHere’s an example of Nike’s content found on an earned or shared channel. It’s a product review published by Hypebeast, a streetwear and contemporary lifestyle magazine:\n\nPaid Channels\n\nPaid channels are pay-to-play. In exchange for promoting your content on an external site, you pay a fee. This can include various platforms such as:\n\nPaid ads\nSocial media ads\nSponsored content\nInfluencers or reviewers who are paid to speak about your brand\n\nHere’s an example of a sponsored article running on a technology website, Apple Insider:\n\nTo memorize this concept more effectively, save and share this infographic:\n\nHow to Choose Between Content Distribution Channels\n\nIf you’re wondering how, where, and when to promote your content, there are a few factors to consider.\n\nPaid channels generate results quickly but require ongoing investment to sustain growth. The second you turn off the ad spend, you’ll see an immediate downturn in traffic, reach, and engagement. \n\nOrganic channels, both owned and earned, take longer to see results. However, those results will be sustainable and more stable. \n\nRemember that building a loyal fanbase doesn’t happen overnight. It takes time. The best way is to strike a healthy balance between paid and organic distribution channels.\n\nTo simplify the process of choosing your optimal channels, we’ve prepared some comparisons below. There, you’ll find detailed information on what types of content are distributed on those channels, target KPIs, and other important metrics to keep track of.\n\nOwned Content Distribution Channels\n\nThese channels are central to any brand. They are owned by you, and you alone have full control over the content. \n\nWhy is this important? Because you can remove or update copy, tweak it to improve your performance, and keep tabs on your backlink profile and interlinking strategy.\n\nIn addition, you can communicate directly with your “owned” audience and nurture these contacts, moving them down the funnel.\n\nChannel\n\n\t\n\nTypes of content to distribute\n\n\t\n\nTarget KPIs\n\n\t\n\nMetrics to track\n\n\n\n\nYour website\n\n\t\nPillar pages\nProduct landing pages\nRelease notifications\nProduct descriptions\nSuccess stories\nGated content (ebooks, white papers, templates, and checklists)\n\t\nBrand awareness\nLead generation\nConversions\n\t\nTraffic\nRankings\nBounce rate\nTime on page\nPages per session\nDwell time\nTraffic sources\nContent downloads\nConversion rates\nDomain Authority score\nBacklinks\n\n\n\nYour blog\n\n\t\nBlog posts\nInfographics\nLong-read guides\nCase studies\n\t\nBrand awareness\nUser engagement\nLead generation\nConversions\n\t\nTraffic\nRankings \nTime on page\nDwell time\nIn-blog banner clicks\nConversion rates\nExit rate\nShares\nComments\nBacklinks\n\n\n\nEmails and Newsletters\n\n\t\nDigests & newsletters\nRelease notifications\nWebinar invites and recaps\nSurveys\nSpecial offers\n\t\nLead nurturing\nUser engagement\nConversions\n\t\nOpen rate\nClick through rate (CTR)\nClick to open rate (CTOR)\nUnsubscriptions\n\n\n\nSocial media profiles, YouTube, podcast platforms\n\n\t\nPosts about product updates\nPosts promoting content and events\nEducational, inspirational, entertaining posts\nCommunity engagement posts\nInfluencer takeovers\nYouTube videos\nPodcasts\n\t\nBrand awareness\nUser engagement\nLead generation\n\t\nLikes/pvotes\nComments\nShares\nFollowers\nClicks to your website\nContent downloads/ registrations coming from social media\nViews\nPlays\nEarned Content Distribution Channels\n\nIf your earned platform is an influencer, industry thought leader, or top media publisher, getting traction here is worth it. You get your brand in front of a massive audience who’s already loyal to or engaged with that media channel.\n\nThe downside is that these channels give you less control because the resource you publish your content on doesn’t belong to you. \n\nThat means it’s harder to review outdated content, track its performance, and convert users into leads. Another issue is that the owner can decide to take down that content at any time.\n\nChannel\n\n\t\n\nTypes of content to distribute\n\n\t\n\nTarget KPIs\n\n\t\n\nMetrics to track\n\n\n\n\nGuest posts\n\n\t\nBlog posts\nGuides\nSuccess stories\n\t\nBrand awareness\nLead generation\nUser engagement\nConversions\n\t\nReferral traffic\nBacklinks to your site\nComments\nShares\nReach\n\n\n\nForums and communities\n\n\t\nProduct FAQs\nProduct descriptions\nUpdates and announcements\nForum discussions\n\t\nBrand awareness\nLead generation\nUser engagement\n\t\nReferral traffic\nLinks to your site\nComments\n\n\n\nReview websites\n\n\t\nProduct reviews\nProduct descriptions\nSuccess stories\n\t\nBrand awareness\nLead generation\nUser engagement\n\t\nPositive/negative reviews\nReferral traffic\n\n\n\nBrand mentions\n\n\t\nProduct reviews\nProduct descriptions\nConversations about your brand\n\t\nBrand awareness\nLead generation\n\t\nReferral traffic\nSentiment\nPaid Content Distribution Channels\n\nThese channels might be called the most challenging ones, as using them requires careful ROI forecasting and budget planning. \n\nOn the other hand, they offer you an opportunity to kickstart a promotional campaign in a day and get quick, measurable results affecting the bottom line.\n\nChannel\n\n\t\n\nTypes of content to distribute\n\n\t\n\nTarget KPIs\n\n\t\n\nMetrics to track\n\n\n\n\nPay per click (PPC)\n\n\t\nPaid search campaigns\n\t\nLead generation\nConversions\n\t\nCTR\nCost per click (CPC)\nConversion rate\nTarget landing page bounce rate\n\n\n\nSocial media ads\n\n\t\nPaid social media ads (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)\n\t\nBrand awareness\nLead generation\nConversions\n\t\nImpressions\nCTR\nCPC\nConversion rate\nDownloads\nTarget landing page bounce rate\n\n\n\nDisplay ads\n\n\t\nDisplay ad campaigns\n\t\nBrand awareness\nLead generation\nConversions\n\t\nImpressions\nCost per one thousand impressions (CMP)\nCTR\nCPC\nConversion rate\nTarget landing page bounce rate\n\n\n\nPaid influencers websites/social media profiles\n\n\t\nBlog posts\nGuides\nSuccess stories\nPress releases\nReviews\nPaid social media collaborations and features\n\t\nBrand awareness\nLead generation\nUser engagement\nConversions\n\t\nReferral traffic\nBounce rate\nLinks to your website\nComments\nShares\nReach\n\n\n\nSponsored content\n\n\t\nBlog posts\nGuides\nSuccess stories\nNewsletter features\n\t\nBrand awareness\nLead generation\nUser engagement\nConversions\n\t\nReferral traffic\nBounce rate\nLinks to your website\nComments\nShares\nReach\n\nImportant: Not all formats are a fit for all channels! You need to take the funnel stage into account. For example, a blog that drives a lot of organic traffic won’t necessarily bring you as many leads if you link to it from a paid ad.\n\nBuilding a Winning Content Distribution Strategy in Six Steps\n\nTo get your content in front of your ideal target audience, you’ll need to do some digging.\n\nStep #1: Research Your Target Audience\n\nStart by analyzing your audience and their preferences to uncover where they’d prefer to consume your content.\n\nPro Tip: Start by asking yourself some of these questions:\n\nWho will benefit from your content the most?\nWill they be interested in your product? \nWhere can they be found?\nWhose opinion do they trust?\n\nHaving this in front of you will help align your distribution and promotional efforts with their preferences and behaviors more effectively. \n\nStep #2: See What Content You Can Distribute First \n\nYou don’t necessarily have to create all content to distribute from scratch. If you look at what assets you already have, you’ll uncover the potential to promote them and deliver results on a specific channel. \n\nNot sure where to start? Conduct a content audit to see if you have existing content ready for distribution. It will save you time by helping you uncover promising, high-value content already at your fingertips. \n\nUsing a tool like Google Analytics or Salesforce, you can do this in two steps:\n\nTake a look at the existing content on your website and analyze its historical performance. Identify the pieces that perform best, and consider promoting them on other channels.\nTake note of how various content types performed on different channels in the past. This indicates which channel(s) were the most effective and can help shape your decision on where to distribute and promote your content. \n\nPro Tip: Plan content creation and distribution together. Your editorial calendar should be an integral part of your content distribution strategy. Using it will help to:\n\nKeep all your content creation and management team on the same page\nMeet all external deadlines and requirements when using earned and paid distribution channels\nMake sure you have all target channels covered\nStep #3: Select Your Media Channels\n\nOwned, earned, or paid—what do you choose? \n\nIn some instances, choosing more than one distribution channel can be beneficial. For example, organic or paid distribution channels could run simultaneously or at different times. \n\nFor quick results, you could start with a paid campaign to promote a piece of content (e.g., an ebook) and then continue sharing it organically once the paid campaign ends. Either way, it’s important to track performance for all promotional initiatives.\n\nWhen deciding on a channel, review the historical performance of your campaigns and content types.\nThen, assess the metrics on those channels, such as their effectiveness and cost.\n\nTo get a clearer picture of how your campaign could perform well, look back at your audience research and revisit the channels they were most successful with. \n\nFor instance, you might see a pattern where an ebook received the most engagement and downloads from LinkedIn, but it did nothing on Facebook.\n\nOr, maybe your marketing meme campaign went viral on Instagram and Twitter but failed to generate any website traffic.\n\n3. To get on the other side of these challenges, performing an analysis of your competitor’s key channels can help inform your decision.\n\nThe Semrush Traffic Analytics tool is great for analyzing the potential of a channel. \n\nJust put in the website of your competitor and view estimated monthly traffic, audience insights (including geography and demographic information), and even traffic sources by type.\n\nHere’s an example from a popular national newspaper:\n\nHere you can see the biggest sources of traffic for the website, and the top websites people go to when leaving it.\n\nStep #4: Decide Which KPIs To Track\n\nLike the comparison tables we shared earlier, KPIs for each of your content efforts will depend on which distribution channels you decide to use. \n\nFor example, you might track organic search views rather than downloads depending on whether your content piece is gated or ungated.\n\nThe important point is to focus on the metrics that align with your business goals—not the vanity ones. \n\nPro Tip: Ensure each content piece is “equipped” for your set KPIs. For example, include a CTA in a blog post that inspires action to boost lead generation and conversions. \n\nFor instance, below you can see a CTA banner Zendesk added in a blog post targeting SMB retailers.\n\nStep #5: Adjust Your Promotional Message \n\nA marketing message is not just what you say, but how you say it.\n\nConsider the environment and how it addresses your audience’s needs. People react to insensitive messages, and that could seriously hurt your brand.\n\nFor instance, just think of how much the pandemic changed how people work and communicate. With this in mind, it’s important to consider the needs of your target audience and adjust your message in a positive, engaging light.\n\nA powerful recent example of this is Victoria’s Secret. The lingerie company that long promoted its products in the spirit of male fantasy made a complete turnaround with the “What Women Want” campaign. \n\nIn its goal to reach its target audience (women), it replaced its iconic angels with a collective of strong, body-positive women. \n\nTo distribute this message, they launched a podcast featuring its powerful new brand ambassadors. This is considered successful in that they made an effort to reach their target audience through new media platforms—Spotify, Apple Podcasts, the Google Play Store, and iHeart Radio. \n\nThey also shifted their content topics to better align with their new brand message, focusing on work, societal issues, and challenges modern women face.\n\nLastly, your promotional message will be impacted by the requirements and style of the third-party channel, so don’t neglect editorial guidelines when using earned and paid channels.\n\nPro Tip: If you’re distributing several content pieces on the same topic at the same time, make sure they align with the needs of your target audience. For example, a promoted blog post, a sponsored update on social media, and an email should all have a consistent tone of voice. \n\nStep #6: Measure Your Performance\n\nThe more analytics data you gather at this step, the easier it will be to make informed decisions on changing channels, repurposing high-performing assets, and boosting your strategy as a whole. \n\nTo collect the data, you can look to our trusty Google Search Console, Google Analytics, and the native analytics of social media platforms.\n\nPro Tip: Use Urchin Traffic Monitor codes (UTMs) on earned and paid distribution channels to make performance tracking easier. Check out this guide on how to set them up.\n\nTop Content Distribution Tools and Platforms\n\nAs the importance of content distribution becomes more understood, more automation is being introduced to support the growing needs of digital marketers. Also, the number of paid and owned platforms continues to rise, providing more choice in where you direct your efforts.\n\nBelow, you’ll find a short overview of the resources that can help you promote your content and more easily measure its performance. \n\nOwned Distribution Platforms\n\nFacebook: the biggest social networking site (so far), with nearly 3B monthly active users. Brands can leverage both organic and paid content promotion on this platform through Reels, Stories, standard posts, and more.\n\nInstagram: a photo-based social media platform owned by Meta, Facebook’s parent company. Similar to Facebook, you can post a variety of photos, Stories, and video content either organically or through paid promotion.\n\nTwitter: a micro-blogging site limited to 280 characters per post. This platform is used by brands of all sizes and industries to connect and engage with their audiences through both organic and paid options.\n\nLinkedIn: a social channel used primarily for businesses and professionals. Brands can post videos, photos, blogs, and more. Both organic and paid promotions are used, and content tends to be more educational and informative.\n\nGoogle Business Profile: a free tool that lets businesses control how they appear in Google Search and Google Maps. You can post blogs, special offers, events, and other details to promote your business. You can also monitor and respond to reviews from customers in your community.\n\nEarned Distribution Platforms\n\nMedium: an open digital publishing platform with 170M readers which can be connected to Twitter.
