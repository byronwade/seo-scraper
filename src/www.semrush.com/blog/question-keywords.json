  "content": "What Are Question Keywords?\n\nQuestion keywords are search queries that are phrased in question form. They often start with “how,” “what,” or “where.”\n\nFor example, question keywords related to “SEO” are “what is SEO” and “how to do SEO.”\n\nPro tip\n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool (as shown above) to find question keywords that are relevant to your brand.\n\nTargeting question-based keywords with your content is often a great idea.\n\nSearchers using question keywords are looking for very specific information. Which means you often know exactly what content to create to answer these searchers’ needs.\n\nIn other words, you should have a relatively easy time satisfying the searcher’s search intent. And that’s key for ranking well in Google results.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn how to find and use question keywords to grab the attention of your target audience.\n\nBut first, here are more reasons you should target question keywords.\n\nAdvantages of Targeting Question Keywords\n\nIn addition to clear intent, question keywords present the following benefits to marketers trying to drive organic traffic.\n\n1. They Have Lower Competition\n\nQuestion keywords are generally easier to rank for because they are often less competitive than short-tail keywords (i.e., broader, shorter keywords that often get more searches per month).\n\nFor example, the search query “keyword research” is extremely competitive. As indicated by the high Keyword Difficulty of 99%.\n\nNote\n\nKeyword Difficulty (KD) is an estimation of how competitive a keyword is. Higher scores suggest more difficulty in ranking.\n\nBut the question “what to do after keyword research,” is far less competitive. With a lower Keyword Difficulty of 0%.\n\nEven if question keywords have lower search volume (i.e., the estimated number of searches a keyword gets per month), they are often worth targeting. Because you can likely rank in the top 10 organic results with relatively little SEO effort.\n\nFurther reading: How to Find Low-Competition Keywords with Semrush\n\n2. They Attract More Qualified Visitors\n\nQualified visitors are users who are most likely to start a relationship with your company.\n\nAnd because question keywords are more focused, you can usually use them to target more qualified visitors.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nLet’s say you are a real estate agent and you want to get leads through organic search. \n\nYou can target the keyword “real estate.” But that keyword is very broad. It could represent users who want a definition of the term or want to become agents themselves.\n\nBut consider the question keywords, “what to ask a real estate agent” or “what questions to ask a real estate agent.”\n\nIt’s safe to assume that searchers who use those queries are actively in the process of looking for or hiring a real estate agent. \n\nMeaning stronger conversion and revenue opportunities for your business.\n\n3. They Can Give You a Better Chance to Rank for SERP Features\n\nGoogle search results often contain SERP features or results outside of the traditional blue links.\n\nFor example, some search results contain a People Also Ask (PAA) section close to the top of the page. That lists out commonly asked questions related to the initial search query.\n\nAnd Google displays PAA for question keywords about 86% percent of the time. Which means targeting question keywords can get your page in the PAA section.\n\nWhich can lead to more organic visitors to your content.\n\nFurther reading: How to Maximize People Also Ask SEO Opportunities\n\nHow to Find Question Keywords\n\nUse tools to find out what questions your audience is asking on Google.\n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool is a keyword research tool that generates related keywords based on seed keywords.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nGo to the Keyword Magic Tool. Enter your seed keyword, choose the right location, and hit “Search.”\n\nNote\n\nYour seed keyword can be a broad topic related to your website or a specific service that you offer.\n\nThen, click on the “Questions” filter to get a list of relevant questions related to your seed keyword.\n\nYou’ll get a list of question keywords to choose from. Pay attention to the following metrics:\n\nKeyword Difficulty (KD): How easy or difficult it is to rank for a keyword\nSearch volume: The estimated number of searches a keyword gets per month\nSearch intent: What the searcher hopes to gain from searching (e.g., transactional intent means they want to buy a product, while informational intent means they want to learn something)\n\nWhen you find keywords that fit your brand, click on the checkbox beside that keyword. And then click the “+ Add to keyword list” button.\n\nYou can repeat this process for other keywords that might be relevant to your website or brand. Like so:\n\nGet Keyword Suggestions\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool, the Biggest Keyword Database on the Market\n\nTry for Free →\nCheck on Google’s People Also Ask Section\n\nYou can also look at People Also Ask to get ideas for question keywords.\n\nEnter a keyword related to your products or services in the Google search bar. \n\nIf there is a PAA displayed, review the questions.\n\nAdd those questions to a list (to later add to your content). Or look for answers that are incomplete or low-quality.\n\nFor example, the below snippet doesn’t actually answer the question, “Which interior design styles are timeless?”\n\nProviding a better, more detailed answer in your content could lead to your webpage ranking for this PAA snippet instead.\n\nUse Google’s Autocomplete\n\nGoogle’s autocomplete feature predicts what users are typing into the search bar. It can be another great place to discover question keywords.\n\nStart with a question related to your website. Like so: \n\nThen review the various autocomplete suggestions. If those questions are relevant to your topic areas, add them to a list to later answer in your content. \n\nFor example, some of the above autocompletes could become an article or blog post on an interior design website.\n\nNote\n\nGoogle uses data from millions of searches to power its autocomplete feature.\n\nSo you can be confident that many other users are asking the questions shown there. \n\nLook through Forums like Quora & Reddit\n\nPeople love asking questions on forums. So use them to do some audience research and figure out what your target audience is asking their peers.\n\nWe recommend starting off with Quora and Reddit.\n\nIf you’re new to Quora or Reddit, you’ll need to create accounts. (They’re both free.)\n\nThen, join spaces and groups that are related to your products, services, or areas of expertise.\n\nTo find questions in Quora, click on the “Questions,” tab of a specific space.\n\nYou’ll see a complete list of all of the questions people have posted.\n\nYou can use those questions as ideas for your own content.\n\nOr answer the question in Quora by clicking “Answer.” This is a great way to show off your own industry expertise to forum members. \n\nPro tip\n\nRegularly answering questions on forums can be a great way to display your industry expertise. Make sure to include your business name in your profile so it is displayed with your answers. Users who see your answers may be motivated to learn more about your company, website, products or service offering.\n\nYou can repeat a similar process for finding questions on Reddit. \n\nNote\n\nPosts that have a lot of upvotes or engagements can signal that many people are interested in the keyword questions or answers.\n\nSo consider answering those same questions in your own website content.\n\nHow to Use Question Keywords on Your Website\n\nNow that you’ve found questions-based keywords, it’s time to create content to answer those questions.\n\nHere are some ways to incorporate those answers naturally into your website.\n\nCreate Blog Posts That Directly Answer the Question\n\nBlog posts are great for targeting question keywords.\n\nAnd answering a question keyword directly within the first few paragraphs of your post can increase your chances of ranking well for that keyword.\n\nFor example, the top result for “what is ui design” is a post from the Interaction Design Foundation. With that exact keyword as the title on the SERP.\n\nClicking into the article, you’ll find that the article answers the question keyword directly. Within its first few sections.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse your target question keyword in the headers of your article. For example, the first H2 in the above blog post is the target question keyword.\n\nIf you don’t know how to start creating quality blog posts, we recommend using one of our blog post templates.\n\nHere are three that you can use, specifically to target question keywords.\n\nCreate a Beginner’s Guide to Target Multiple Question Keywords\n\nBeginner’s guides introduce readers to a topic in a straightforward, elementary way. They usually cover the most common questions people have about a topic.\n\nThey are great for targeting question keywords. Because they usually include sections like “What is X?” or “Why is X important?”\n\nFor example, our beginner’s guide to semantic HTML covers the topic, “What Are Semantic HTML Tags?”\n\nAnd ranks as the featured snippet for that keyword.\n\nBeginner’s guides usually have the following format:\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is [topic]?\nWhy is [topic] important?\nHow to do [topic]\nConclusion\n\nMeaning you get to include a couple of question keywords in your headers. And increase your chances for ranking well.\n\nTo start writing your beginner’s guide, we recommend using Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nGo to the tool and click “Analyze my text.”\n\nThen, tell the tool what keywords you want to optimize your article for. And where your target audience is located.\n\nThen, start typing away in the space provided. Remembering to include your target question keywords within the headers, when possible.\n\nThe tool will give a list of recommendations for the blog post. Including word count, tone of voice, and suggested terms.\n\nMake sure to use the bodies of each section to provide detailed answers. \n\nCreate ‘How-to’ Content to Rank for the Featured Snippet\n\n“How-to” content provides readers (or viewers) with a step-by-step guide on how to do a certain action. This can come in the form of an article, a video, or even an infographic.\n\nAnd they can rank for featured snippets.\n\nLike this:\n\nTo start creating “how-to” content, you need to find “how-to” keywords that have featured snippets.\n\nFirst, go to the Keyword Magic Tool. Enter your topic into the tool. And click, “Search.”\n\nAnd use the following filters:\n\nSelect the “Questions” filter\nSelect the “Include keywords” filter and enter “how” into the space provided. And click “Apply.”\nSelect the “Advanced filters” filter and click on the drop-down menu under “SERP Features” Select “Featured snippet” and click “Apply”\n\nNow you have a list of “how-to” keywords that you can target with “how-to” content.\n\nAnd all you need to do is start creating quality content. With your question keyword as the title of your content.\n\nAnd each step in the process as its own H2.\n\nPro tip\n\nIf you don’t want to manually create content, use ContentShake AI. It can generate high-quality, optimized, blog posts in a few clicks. (But always review AI content before publishing.)\n\nHere’s an example of “how-to” content.\n\nPro tip\n\nLook to the search results page to figure out what kind of content you need to create. For example, if there is a video ranking in the top result, consider creating a video instead of a blog post.\n\nCreate Listicles to Rank for Questions with Multiple Answers.\n\nListicle content provides users with a variety of answers. It often includes a numerical value to communicate how many items are in the list. \n\nListicle content is a great option when users ask questions where they want multiple answers or suggestions.\n\nFor example, consider the keyword question “what to watch on netflix.”\n\nGoogle ranks mostly listicle-style posts on the first page. Because they know the user is not looking for a specific answer, but wants to compare and contrast multiple products, services, or options.\n\nYou can use the SEO Content Template to get detailed suggestions for how to create a listicle-style post.\n\nEnter your keyword question. Then click, “Create Content Template.”\n\nThe template will include the top-ranking search results for the keyword question. Along with a list of suggested words to include in your content.\n\nYou may want to include those terms as items in your listicle. For example, this SEO content template for “what to do in santorini,” could include “sunset view,” “wine tour,” and “hike from fira to oia” in the list.\n\nMake sure to also review the top-ranking competitors highlighted in the template.\n\nAnd follow the suggested word count, tone of voice, and meta tag recommendations to increase the ranking potential of your listicle.\n\nAdd FAQ Sections to Your Content\n\nFrequently asked question (FAQ) sections are designed for exactly this: questions and answers. So you can use FAQ sections to easily implement questions and answers.\n\nThey can appear in two places:\n\nIn a standalone page, like so:\n\nOr at the end of a blog post, like so:\n\nStandalone FAQ pages are usually about products or policies. So for those, you’d need to know what your customers are asking by talking to those customers directly. Or with your customer service team.\n\nBlog post FAQ sections, on the other hand, are questions about specific topics. Which means you can more easily optimize those FAQs with question keywords.\n\nTo start creating your optimized blog post FAQ section, find question keywords related to your posts’s topic.\n\nBy entering your post’s target keyword into the Keyword Overview tool. Selecting a target location. Then, clicking “Search.”\n\nScroll down to find the “Questions” section of the report. And click the “View all # keywords” button below the list.\n\nNow you have a list of question keywords to include in your blog post’s FAQ section.\n\nMake sure you include the complete question you found during your keyword research.\n\nAnd provide informative, relevant, and high-quality answers.\n\nStart Answering Questions for Your Audience\n\nQuestion keywords provide low-competition opportunities to get high-quality website traffic.\n\nSo answering questions is an easy and effective way to improve SEO.\n\nStart adding more questions and answers to your content with the following tools: \n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool to find questions for keywords\nThe SEO Writing Assistant to compose long-form blog posts with detailed answers\nContentShake AI to help you write blog posts faster\nThe SEO Content Template to get suggestions for listicles\n\nAnd then make your website a place where your target audience can find all the answers they seek. \n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
