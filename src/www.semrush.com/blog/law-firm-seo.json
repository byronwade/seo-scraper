  "content": "What Is Law Firm SEO?\n\nLaw firm search engine optimization (SEO) is working to improve a legal practice’s visibility in relevant search engine results—without paying for ads. Common tactics include publishing useful blog posts, improving site speed, and acquiring positive reviews on Google.\n\nWith the right SEO marketing strategy, your law office can earn organic (unpaid) rankings like these:\n\nAnd ultimately get more clients.\n\nNote\n\nLaw firm SEO is also known as lawyer SEO, attorney SEO, or law office SEO.\n\nIs SEO Important for Law Firms?\n\nSEO is important for most law firms and lawyers because it’s a cost-effective way to attract new clients.\n\nEvery month, millions of people search for legal services and information through Google. \n\nOn average, more than 45% of desktop searchers click an organic search result. And 27.6% click on something to enhance their search (like a search suggestion), 1.8% click an ad, and 25.6% click nothing at all.\n\nAnd the higher you rank in organic search results, the more exposure and clicks you’re likely to get:\n\nSEO is the tried-and-tested way to improve organic rankings.\n\nAnd while you need to invest in your legal SEO efforts, organic search can be far more cost-effective than other marketing channels.\n\nFor example, law firm Morgan & Morgan gets around 630.6K organic visits from Google every month (in the U.S. on desktop). According to Semrush’s Organic Research tool.\n\nWe don’t know their SEO budget. But it’s probably far less than the estimated $16.9 million it’d take to get this traffic through search advertising.\n\nAnalyze Competitors’ SEO\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n7 Best SEO Tactics for Law Firms\n\nWhen doing SEO for attorneys or law firms, certain tactics work better than others.\n\nHere are our top recommendations:\n\n1. Demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness\n\nGoogle wants to rank law firms that demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). Because it wants to give users reliable results.\n\nEspecially since law is a Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) topic. Meaning poor-quality information and services can seriously harm people’s lives.\n\nLaw firm Latham & Watkins demonstrates E-E-A-T through an “Achievements'' page. Which features case studies, awards, and accolades.\n\nThe firm also provides detailed information about its attorneys.\n\nBy showcasing photos, contact details, qualifications, and more, they make it clear that their lawyers are real and credible experts.\n\nIn addition to demonstrating E-E-A-T on your website, try to build a positive reputation across the web.\n\nOne of the best ways to do this is to build quality backlinks.\n\n2. Build Quality Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are links that point to your site from other sites. In addition to driving traffic and brand awareness, they can have a significant impact on your law firm’s Google rankings.\n\nYou can learn the details in our backlinks guide, but know this as a general rule of thumb: \n\nThe higher the quantity and quality of backlinks your site has, the more authoritative it’s perceived to be.\n\nWorking to acquire backlinks is known as link building.\n\nTo get started, make sure your legal practice is listed on reputable directories like:\n\nBest Law Firms\nAvvo\nFindLaw\nJustia\n\nAnd then pursue your unlinked brand mentions.\n\nFor example, if a client has named your firm in a blog post, ask if they’re willing to add a link.\n\nYou could also try:\n\nConnectively: Respond to journalists’ requests for legal commentary\nBroken link building: Find broken links to competitors’ sites and convince webmasters to link to your site instead\nSkyscraper technique: Create a better version of highly linked content in your niche (e.g., legal guides) and convince influencers to link to your version instead\n\nWhen you’re ready to elevate your efforts, use Semrush’s Link Building Tool.\n\nIt identifies link building prospects (sites that might link to you) based on your target keywords and competitors. And gives each opportunity a rating out of five.\n\nYou can then use the tool to send and track outreach emails (messages designed to convince prospects to give you a link).\n\nAnd monitor the backlinks you acquire.\n\nSecure Valuable Backlinks\n\nwith the Link Building Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n3. Perform Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research is the process of finding what your target audience searches for in Google. \n\nIt’s one of the most important tasks when doing SEO for law firms. Because it helps you identify new ranking opportunities. And optimize your content more effectively.\n\nTo get started, open Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nAnd enter a basic term related to your business (e.g., “divorce”).\n\nThe tool will provide a list of search terms that include your starting term or a close variation.\n\nAlong with the following metrics:\n\nIntent: The type of search intent, which is the general purpose behind the user’s search\nVolume: The keyword search volume, meaning the average number of monthly searches\nKD %: The keyword difficulty score, which measures how hard it is to rank highly for a given term\nSF: The number of non-standard results (SERP features) that appear\n\nVarious filters and sorting options make it easy to find the best keyword opportunities.\n\nFor example, use the “Questions” filter to find legal queries you can answer through blog posts.\n\nThen, apply a keyword difficulty filter to focus on the least competitive terms.\n\nClick the check boxes and then “Add to keyword list” to save the terms you want to rank for.\n\nThat way, you can view and organize them in Keyword Strategy Builder.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n4. Create Optimized Content\n\nTo rank for your target keywords, you’ll need to create quality content that’s optimized for search engines and your target audience.\n\nThe most important thing is aligning with search intent—what the user wants to achieve.\n\nFor example, people who search “can you divorce without splitting assets” need reliable information about their legal options.\n\nThat’s why the top-ranking results are high-quality, in-depth guides.\n\nWhereas someone searching “divorce lawyer in queens” is looking to hire a local attorney.\n\nSo, the top results are about relevant services in that area.\n\nTip\n\nWhen analyzing keywords in Semrush, click the “View SERP” button or icon to view the Google results page.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, E-E-A-T is an important concept in law firm SEO (though not a direct ranking factor). So, give readers (and Google) good reason to trust your content.\n\nGenerally, quality content is:\n\nComprehensive\nWell-written\nAccurate and up to date\nCreated by a topical expert\nPresented in a user-friendly way\n\nAnd make sure to follow our on-page SEO checklist. To give your content the best possible chance of ranking highly.\n\nYou can get help with Semrush’s SEO Content Template.\n\nSimply enter your target keyword(s), define your target audience, and click “Create content template.”\n\nThen, the tool will provide SEO recommendations based on the top-ranking pages.\n\nFor example, you’ll get a suggested word count and readability score.\n\nWhen you’re ready to start writing, send your brief to the SEO Writing Assistant.\n\nLike this:\n\nThe tool provides suggestions and scores to help you meet your targets.\n\nAnd Smart Writer tools that make the writing process easier.\n\nFurther reading: Content Marketing for Law Firms\n\nGet Content Recommendations\n\nwith the SEO Content Template Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n5. Maintain Your Google Business Profile\n\nIf your legal practice caters to local clients, it should have a well-maintained Google Business Profile (GBP).\n\nThis can help you rank highly in the local pack (the map section that appears when people explicitly or implicitly search for products or services in their area).\n\nAnd in Google Maps:\n\nYour business profile may also appear in other contexts (e.g., when people search your brand name).\n\nSo, it’s important that it makes a good impression. And provides all the information potential clients need.\n\nTo get started, sign into GBP and enter your business name.\n\nIf necessary, follow the steps to add or claim your business. And verify its location.\n\nThen, make sure your profile is complete and accurate.\n\nFor example, Pardalis and Nohavicka Lawyers entered their opening date. Which enabled Google to display a “7+ years in business” attribute.\n\nThey also provided photos, a list of legal services, accessibility information, and more.\n\nOnce you’ve completed your profile, you can focus on:\n\nKeeping it updated, so clients always get the right information\nResponding to your Google reviews, to show that you care about client feedback\nGenerating more reviews (e.g., by sending review request emails)\n\nThese efforts can help you improve your local rankings and attract more clients. \n\n6. Find and Fix Technical SEO Issues\n\nTechnical SEO issues can harm your website’s rankings and user experience.\n\nExamples include:\n\nBroken links\n\n\t\n\nLinks that point to invalid URLs frustrate users and make it harder for search engine crawlers to explore your site efficiently\n\n\n\n\nSlow page speeds\n\n\t\n\nPage speed metrics known as the Core Web Vitals can affect Google rankings. Because users want pages that load quickly.\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate content\n\n\t\n\nIdentical or near-identical content wastes Google’s resources for crawling and indexing. And can weaken your SEO efforts.\n\n\n\n\nMissing title tags\n\n\t\n\nFailing to provide an HTML page title can make it harder for users and search engines to understand what your pages are about\n\n\n\n\nRobots.txt errors\n\n\t\n\nIssues with your robots.txt file make it difficult for search engines to understand which pages should be crawled (and which shouldn’t)\n\nYou can check your site for over 140 issues with Semrush’s Site Audit tool.\n\nAfter setting it up based on the Site Audit configuration guide, head to the “Issues” report for a full breakdown.\n\nWe recommend that you work on “Errors,” then “Warnings,” then “Notices.”\n\nClick “Why and how to fix it” for more advice on each issue. \n\nThen, click “Send to…” to send a task to your task manager (if you use one).\n\nIn some cases, you might need to assign the task to a web developer or SEO specialist.\n\nYou’ll often resolve technical issues via your website’s content management system (CMS).\n\nBut you might need to use Google Search Console. It’s a free tool that lets you request Google indexing and handle other technical tasks.\n\nIt can also help you monitor SEO results. As we’ll discuss in the next section.\n\nFind and Fix Website Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n7. Monitor Your SEO Results\n\nMonitoring your SEO results allows you to see what’s working and what isn’t. So you can improve your law firm’s search engine optimization strategy over time.\n\nWe recommend that you use three tools: Position Tracking, Google Search Console, and Google Analytics 4.\n\nLet’s explore what you can do with each one:\n\nPosition Tracking\n\nPosition Tracking is a Semrush tool that makes it easy to monitor your Google rankings.\n\nSelect the search engine, device type, and location you want to monitor. \n\nThen, import the keywords you want to rank for.\n\nYou can add tags if you want the ability to monitor keywords in groups.\n\nOnce everything’s set up, head to the “Overview” report.\n\nAnd click the bell icon to set up ranking alerts like this:\n\nReference the graphs anytime to get an understanding of your overall performance.\n\nOr scroll down to the table for a full rankings breakdown.\n\nYou can change the time range in the upper-right.\n\nIn addition to your current and past positions, you can see:\n\nKeyword search volumes and difficulty scores\nWhich keywords trigger SERP features and whether your site ranks for them\nEstimated monthly traffic\n\nAnd more.\n\nUse the filters to focus on keywords or rankings that meet specific criteria.\n\nFor example, you can see which featured snippets you’re missing out on. And try to pursue them.\n\nTrack Your Rankings\n\nwith the Position Tracking Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nGoogle Search Console\n\nWith Google Search Console, you can find:\n\nHow many impressions (views) and clicks your Google results generate\nYour average click-through rate (i.e., the percentage of impressions that drive clicks)\nYour average position for up to 1,000 popular queries\n\nAfter setting up the tool, go to “Performance” > “Search results.”\n\nThen, choose the time range you’re interested in. \n\nClick all the checkboxes above the graph to see how each metric has fluctuated over time.\n\nThen, scroll down to see metrics by query, page, country, device, search appearance, or date.\n\nYou can also apply filters based on these dimensions.\n\nFurther reading: Google Search Console: The Ultimate Guide\n\nGoogle Analytics 4\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 (GA4) is a free website analytics platform that provides insight into your visitors’ demographics and behavior.\n\nIn the “Traffic acquisition” report, you can compare the following data for each channel (including organic search):\n\nUsers: The number of unique visitors\nSessions: The number of visits\nEngaged sessions: How many visits lasted longer than 10 seconds, generated a conversion event (e.g., a purchase), or included at least two page views\nAverage engagement time per session: How long the average visit lasts when your site was the user’s primary focus\nEngaged sessions per user: The average number of engaged visits each user makes\nEvents per session: The average number of conversion events per visit\n\nTip\n\nCheck out Google’s advice on creating conversion events.\n\nTo focus on organic search data in other reports, add a comparison or filter.\n\nLike this:\n\nSo, how can you use this feature?\n\nLet’s say your law firm only takes clients in the U.S.\n\nIn the “Demographic details” report, you can see which countries your organic visitors come from. And determine whether your SEO strategy is working as desired.\n\nFurther reading: Google Analytics for Beginners\n\nLaw Firm SEO Services: What You Should Know\n\nIf you don’t have the internal resources required to achieve your desired results, consider outsourcing your SEO to an agency or freelancer.\n\nWe recommend using specialists who focus on law firm SEO services. \n\nAfter all, the legal sector presents unique challenges and opportunities.
