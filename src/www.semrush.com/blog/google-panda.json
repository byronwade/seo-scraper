  "content": "What Is Google Panda?\n\nGoogle Panda is a search algorithm update introduced in February 2011.\n\nPanda’s goal was to reduce the number of low-quality websites on search engine results pages (SERPs). It was one of Google’s earliest updates aimed at controlling content quality.\n\nBy filtering out thin and irrelevant pages, Panda helped users find more useful content on Google. \n\nToday, Google Panda no longer exists as its own entity. But it remains part of Google’s core algorithm. \n\nWhy Did Google Create Panda?\n\nGoogle launched Panda to curb the content farms—also known as mills—that once dominated the SERPs. \n\nContent mills are companies who hire freelance writers to create content as fast as possible. They almost always favor quantity over quality. \n\nThe goal of content mills was to rank well on search engines to generate more advertising revenue. They would churn out unhelpful, low-quality content in bulk—often consisting of similar topics with slight keyword variations. \n\nBefore Panda, Google’s quality control wasn’t great. So these sites flooded the SERPs.\n\nThis meant repetitive, untruthful, and even plagiarized content could reach the number one spot on Google. \n\nGoogle introduced Panda to assess the quality of web pages. And reward high-quality content with better rankings. \n\nThrough its evaluation process (we’ll explore what triggers Google Panda later), Google Panda could separate content farm articles from expert-written articles. \n\nThe algorithm would then penalize content farm articles, allowing quality articles to rank higher. \n\nSites Most Affected by Panda\n\nThe Google Panda update hit content farms hard. \n\nIt massively diminished their influence on search results as these sites failed to meet Google’s new (and much stricter) quality standards. \n\nFor example, Demand Media was a prominent content farm valued at $1 billion in January 2011. They pumped out thousands of unhelpful articles for various clients. \n\nThe company reported a loss of $6.4 million the year after Google implemented Panda.\n\nBusiness directories with low-quality listings and ecommerce sites with repetitive content also suffered. \n\nWhen rankings tanked, webmasters had to change their SEO strategies. For example, ecommerce sites now had to write unique descriptions for every product page. \n\nAbove all, Panda redefined the standard of what content Google rewarded with high rankings in the SERPs. \n\nWhy Is Google Panda Important?\n\nThe Google Panda update dramatically improved the quality of the SERPs.\n\nPanda encouraged content creators to prioritize quality over quantity and focus on providing value. It’s something Google still focuses on today.\n\nBut that’s not to say Panda defeated low-quality content once and for all. \n\nPanda has been updated several times since its initial launch. Plus, there have been many Google algorithm updates since Panda—Penguin, Pirate, and Hummingbird, to name a few. \n\nHowever, Panda stands out because it was Google’s first major step toward becoming a more effective search engine. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Panda represents the shift towards search engines actually answering search intent. \n\nHow Google Panda Evaluates Content Quality\n\nUpdates to Panda through the years have improved how Google rewards sites with value. And penalizes publishing low-quality content.\n\nTo determine a website’s quality, Panda considered aspects such as:\n\nThe usefulness and uniqueness of the content. Does the content answer what the user is looking for? Is it original to the website? Or is the content thin, poorly structured, and misspelled, or plagiarized from another site? \nThe overall quality of the user experience. Is the information on the page easy to read, or is it hidden between large advertisements? \nThe authority and trustworthiness of the website and its authors. Is it an accurate source of information? Does the writer have experience in the field? Are the sources listed reliable? \n\nWith these guidelines in mind, Google’s algorithm uses a set of rules, calculations, and ranking factors to assign each site a quality score. This helps decide how well the site will rank.\n\nGoogle never discloses the exact ranking signals used in the algorithm. This keeps websites from gaming the system.\n\nBut Google gives us a set of Search Quality Rater Guidelines that help us understand their requirements. They include things like Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T), Core Updates, and Product Review Updates. \n\nFollowing Google’s guidelines will help your site rank. Regardless of algorithm updates, you should always strive to create high-quality content. \n\nWhat Triggers a Google Panda Penalty?\n\nPanda penalizes websites that produce low-quality content on the SERPs.\n\nThe primary factors Panda uses to do this include duplicate, thin, or useless content. \n\nGoogle Panda may also lower rankings for having a high ad-to-content ratio. Or for failing to include enough E-E-A-T signals in your copy. \n\nLet’s look at these triggers more in depth: \n\nDuplicate Content\n\nDuplicate content refers to identical or highly similar content on multiple pages. Either within a single website (internal duplicate content) or across different domains (external duplicate content).\n\nIf the similarities are minimal and unintentional, your site is unlikely to be penalized. But if it appears the duplicate content is deceptive and manipulates search engine results, you’ll likely move down the SERPs.\n\nA great way to see if you have duplicate content is to use the Semrush Site Audit tool. \n\nYou can set up the tool to your specifications using our guide, or use the standard settings. Once you’ve configured your settings, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nOnce the tool crawls all the pages on your site, it will produce a dashboard like this:\n\nTo check for duplicate content issues, click the “Issues” tab. \n\nIf you have any pages with duplicate content—or pages with content that’s at least 85% identical—the tool will flag it as an Error. It will also show you the affected URLs and give you steps to fix them.\n\nFind and Fix Sitemap Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nLow-Quality Content\n\nPanda was based on the idea that low-quality content doesn’t provide value to users. Therefore, it shouldn’t be at the top of the SERPs.\n\nBut what does Panda consider low-quality?\n\nTactics like keyword stuffing (overusing keywords to manipulate the algorithm) affect readability:\n\n“If you’re searching for the best pizza in New York, our pizza restaurant is the best pizza restaurant in New York. We have the best pizza in New York, and our pizza toppings are the best in New York. Come to our pizza restaurant in New York today to try the best pizza in New York!”\n\nThis paragraph is hard to read. And adds no value to the reader. \n\nThe algorithm will likely prevent this content from ranking high on the SERPs based solely on its lack of readability.\n\nIt might seem like an extreme example. But this kind of content was found on page one of Google before Panda. \n\nFor your content to rank highly today, you need to avoid tactics like this.\n\nYou can use Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker to see what pages have keyword stuffing. And other low-quality content issues.\n\nIn On Page SEO Checker, click on the “Optimization Ideas” report: \n\nClick the blue “X Ideas” button next to one of the suggested URLs: \n\nIf you scroll down to the Content section, you’ll see whether you have issues with keyword stuffing: \n\nThin Content\n\nThanks to Panda, web pages containing content with minimal text or relevance are unlikely to rank.\n\nHowever, thin content isn’t only pages with a low word count. This definition also covers: \n\nAuto-generated content: Text within a webpage created using a code or program. This text makes little sense but could have appeared high on the SERPs in the pre-Panda days. This machine-generated copy is low quality, incoherent, and lacking in answers. \nThin affiliate pages: Pages featuring product affiliate links with descriptions and reviews. Usually reproduced from the original merchant with no original content.\nSpun content: This tactic involves taking a piece of content that’s already online and editing it just enough (either manually or with a tool) to pass plagiarism detectors \n\nThe above content types don’t add value. They’re designed to manipulate Google’s algorithm. Panda detects these pages and adjusts rankings as necessary. \n\nLack of E-E-A-T \n\nPanda originally dictated that websites must have Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-A-T) signals. \n\nGoogle rewards sites that meet these criteria with higher rankings.\n\nIn December 2022, Google updated its Quality Rater Guidelines to E-E-A-T, which added a second E for Experience.\n\nWhen analyzing your content, these are factors you need to consider: \n\nExperience: Do you have first-hand experience with the topic of your content or website?\nExpertise: Do you have the knowledge or credentials to be considered a reliable source? \nAuthoritativeness: Do others in your industry look to you as a leader or an expert?\nTrustworthiness: Are you clear about who wrote your content, and is it factually accurate?\n\nIf any of these are missing from your content, see what you can do to improve your E-E-A-T. \n\nA great way to check your authoritativeness? Use Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool to get a general idea of how you compare to your competition. \n\nEnter your domain name and click “Analyze.”\n\nOn the next page, you can enter up to four competitors’ websites:\n\nYou’ll get a chart showing your authority score, and your competitors’:\n\nKeep in mind this isn’t exactly what Google means by authoritativeness. But it will show you what sites in your industry are an authority and give you ideas for improvement. \n\nGet Insights on Backlink Profiles\n\nwith the Backlink Analytics Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nLow-Quality User-Generated Content \n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is exactly what it sounds like—content created by users. This can be anything from Facebook posts to TikTok videos.\n\nGoogle Panda is unlikely to lower your rankings for featuring UGC on your domain if you use it properly. \n\nIf your content is of low value or obviously designed to manipulate rankings, you’ll likely be penalized. Things like spammy comment sections and poorly written guest posts.\n\nThis type of content doesn’t create value for users. And it’s exactly the content Panda was created to mitigate. \n\nExcessive Ads\n\nOne question Google uses to define a high-quality site is: “Does this article have an excessive amount of ads that distract from or interfere with the main content?”\n\nThis means pages composed primarily of ads with little or no original content are considered low-quality. \n\nWe’re sure you’ve seen examples of pages filled with huge ads or images that impede your ability to read the text—this is something Panda aims to combat.\n\nAffiliate Links Surrounded by Low-Quality Content\n\nThis refers to poor content with links pointing to paid affiliate programs. \n\nThese programs are where a business or influencer—known as the “affiliate”—is paid a commission for sending traffic through referral links. \n\nThere’s no issue with using affiliate links in your content. But the content needs to be valuable to the reader on its own. It can’t just set the stage for affiliate links so you can make a profit.\n\nHow Do You Know If You’ve Been Hit by Panda? \n\nGoogle Panda penalizes sites with low-quality content with drops in traffic and rankings, or even deindexing pages. \n\nLet’s look at how you can tell if these issues are affecting your site. \n\nA Drop in Traffic\n\nA sudden drop in organic traffic may be a sign Panda has penalized you. \n\nSemrush’s Organic Research tool can show you traffic to your site. Just put your domain into the tool and click “Search.”\n\nFrom the dashboard, click on the “Traffic” graph. It will open an overview of your traffic for the selected timeframe.\n\nThe chart shows we’ve had a traffic level of 2.3 million over the last month. With an 20.17% increase from the previous month.\n\nBut if this figure showed a significant drop, it may be Google penalizing low-quality content on your website.\n\nTo see if your traffic dip is algorithm-related, use the Semrush Sensor tool. It keeps track of changes made to Google’s algorithm. This tool checks the SERP volatility of the industry you work in. \n\nYou can also see SERP volatility for your website if you have Position Tracking setup. Just click on the “Personal Score” tab: \n\nKeep in mind algorithm updates can often take several days or weeks to complete. If you see a steep drop, wait a few days and see if it recovers before taking drastic action.\n\nA Drop in Rankings \n\nLike diminished traffic, a drop in rankings could indicate you’ve failed to meet Google’s content standards. \n\nTo track this, open the Organic Research tool again. From the dashboard, click “Position Changes.” \n\nYou can see whether your rankings have changed dramatically over the previous month. \n\nScroll down to see how your positions have changed for specific keywords:\n\nIf it’s a Panda-related penalty, you’ll likely have a significant drop in rankings across your site. \n\nPanda penalties affect your whole domain, not just a few pages. \n\nIf only a few of your keywords have dropped, it probably isn’t because of Panda. \n\nFind Competitors\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nA Decrease in Indexed Pages \n\nChecking the index status of your pages regularly allows you to notice changes. You can monitor this using Google Search Console (GSC).\n\nIn GSC, click “Indexing” > “Pages” on the sidebar.\n\nHere, you’ll see a graph showing the total number of indexed and non-indexed pages. And a list of the URLs on your domain with their index status. \n\nScroll down to see the reason your pages aren’t indexed:\n\nIf Panda penalizes your website, you’ll likely see more pages with “Crawled - currently not indexed.” \n\nThis means Google crawled your site and decided not to index these pages. A common reason is that you have too much low-quality content.\n\nTo see which pages are affected, click “Crawled - currently not indexed.” \n\nIf you click “LEARN MORE,” Google will give you more information on the error. \n\nScroll down to see a list of your affected pages:\n\nGo through the affected pages and update their content if you suspect it’s a Panda penalty. Then you can click “VALIDATE FIX” to have Google crawl the page again.\n\nHow to Recover from Panda \n\nPanda penalties can be detrimental to a website's success. Thankfully, recovery is possible.\n\nHere are important initial steps to take:\n\n1. Identify the Source\n\nBefore you can recover from a Panda penalty, it’s critical to identify the source of the problem. This can be difficult, as a Panda penalty may result from one of many factors.\n\nBut as we mentioned above, three common indicators are a drop in traffic, decreased rankings, and an increase in deindexed pages.\n\nOnce you identify the source of the issue, analyze affected pages. Review their content for readability, originality, and relevance.\n\n2. Revise and Refresh Your Content\n\nAsk yourself: does your site provide content that’s informative, relevant, and user friendly? Does it satisfy E-E-A-T?\n\nIf not, update your outdated content. \n\nThe Semrush Topic Research tool can help you get started. Just enter a topic (or your domain) and click “Get content ideas.”\n\nWhen the tool loads, you’ll see several cards with content ideas for your site. \n\nThe tool will also tell you if you cover the topic on your site (green cards) or not (blue cards).\n\nClicking “Show more” at the bottom of a card will open up ideas for headings, related questions, and more. \n\nIf you click “Add to your favorites” next to these ideas, the tool will add them to a list.\n\nScroll back to the top and click “Favorite Ideas.” From here, you can send your ideas to the SEO Content Template or export to an XLSX file. \n\nRepeat the process to generate more content ideas. The more high-quality content you produce, the faster your website will recover.\n\nFind Out What Ranks\n\nwith the Topic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Recover From a Panda Penalty?\n\nThere is no set time frame for recovering from a Panda penalty. Recovering from an algorithmic action can be difficult, and resolving the issues won’t happen overnight.\n\nThe timeline depends on how well you turn your website into a source of value. And how fast. It also depends on how badly your rankings dropped to begin with. \n\nThe good news is, by focusing on creating high-quality content across your website, you’re unlikely to be penalized again in the future.\n\nCreate Quality Content to Avoid Google Penalties\n\nPanda completely redefined “quality content.” \n\nAnd now that you know how it works, you can start creating new content for your website and avoid losing traffic.\n\nA great next step? Start building your SEO strategy with our Ultimate Guide to Content Marketing Strategy. It walks you through crafting an SEO strategy based on high-quality content that gets Panda’s stamp of approval.\n\nFAQs\nIs Google Panda Still a Thing?\n\nGoogle Panda is still very much a thing. It is now part of Google’s core algorithm. The ranking criteria it introduced in 2011—to avoid thin content, duplicate content, etc.—are still used to measure content quality. \n\nWhat Was Google’s Panda Update Also Known as?\n\nThe Google Panda update was also known as the Farmer Update. Google’s name for the update was Panda. This nickname was in honor of Navneet Panda, the software engineer who played an integral role in making the update possible.\n\nWhat Is the Benefit of Google Panda?\n\nGoogle Panda benefits web users by improving the quality of search engine results. It rewards sites with high-quality content and a positive user experience. Its focus is on providing users with exactly what they want.\n\nWebsites who have low-quality content, offer a poor user experience, and lack relevancy get a lower search results ranking. \n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Google Panda and Google Penguin?\n\nPanda’s ranking factors target low-quality content, while Penguin focuses on spammy or manipulative link-building practices. \n\nPanda gave site-wide penalties, meaning it affected all pages on a site. \n\nGoogle Penguin’s penalties are page-specific; they’re applied on individual pages and require you to clean up your link profile before they’re lifted. \n\nIs Word Count a Factor for Panda?\n\nWord count was not a factor for Panda, and there’s still no set minimum word count your pages should have today. \n\nInstead, Google encourages websites to use as many words as required to bring the reader value. \n\nCan External Factors Like Backlinks Impact Google Panda Algorithm Penalties?\n\nBuilding a more robust backlink profile is essential as a general SEO practice. \n\nHowever, Panda didn’t deal directly with backlinks. It’s Google Penguin that’s responsible for these external factors. \n\nHow Often Should I Update My Website’s Content to Comply with Google’s Panda Algorithm?\n\nGoogle is constantly changing, and so are its trends, to keep high-quality content ranking. However, update your website as often as required to stay ahead of your competition.\n\nFor instance, if you have a product review article dated 2023, and your competition has one with 2024 in the title, users are more likely to click the latter for up-to-date information.",
