  "content": "Getting more subscribers on YouTube is key if you want to grow your audience and access the platform’s monetization features.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause hitting 1,000 subscribers is one of the criteria to become a YouTube Partner and start earning money from running ads on your channel.\n\nIn this article, we’ll show you how to get more subscribers on YouTube (for free) and build an engaged audience that drives growth and revenue.\n\n1. Optimize Your YouTube Channel\n\nHow you set your YouTube channel up can impact how many users click the subscribe button.\n\nFor example, if your YouTube channel looks unprofessional, this might damage your credibility. Which makes it harder to get subscribers.\n\nFollow these three steps to ensure your channel is optimized for growth:\n\nWrite a Compelling Channel Description\n\nA channel description is an opportunity to sell your channel and its content to potential subscribers.\n\nA well-crafted description tells your audience: \n\nWhat your channel is about\nThe types of videos they’re likely to see\nWho the channel is for\nThe benefit a subscriber will get from your channel\n\nHere’s the description on the Semrush YouTube channel:\n\nHere are some key things to note about this channel description:\n\nIt shares specific information on the channel topic (up-to-date digital marketing advice)\nIt includes the type of YouTube content the channel focuses on (step-by-step tutorials, practical case studies, and tool guidance)\nIt states who the channel is aimed toward (small business owners, in-house marketing teams, and agencies) with different knowledge levels\nIt tells the audience how the channel helps them (boost online presence and drive business results) \n\nNotice how we’ve included a call to action (CTA) that encourages people to subscribe? \n\nWhen writing your channel description, include the most important information in the first sentence.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the first 100-150 characters or so will show up next to your channel name in YouTube search results. And a well-crafted opening sentence can help inspire clicks that could turn into subscribers.\n\nDon’t forget to include keywords that users search for in your channel description. \n\nThis can help your channel become more visible in YouTube search results and lead to you getting more subscribers.\n\nTarget keywords related to your business, industry, or niche.\n\nFor example, if you run a pizza parlor and want to create a cooking channel for YouTube, suitable keywords might include “homemade pizza dough” or “pizza crust recipe.” \n\nUse a tool like Semrush’s Keyword Analytics for YouTube to identify relevant keywords to target.\n\nFor example, you can explore:\n\nTop keywords: Most popular keywords for a chosen period and country\nFast-growing keywords: The keywords with the most searches for a current period compared to a previous period\nMost-viewed videos: Most popular videos for a chosen period and country\n\nHead over to the tool, then click “Get started” under “Keywords Research.”\n\nSearch for a keyword related to your channel, industry, or niche (e.g., “pizza”).\n\nAnd select your country in the top right, if needed. Then click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will show you related YouTube search terms in the table. \n\nAlong with their “Search Volume” and “Competitive rate.” These metrics tell you how many searches a keyword gets and how competitive it is to rank for the term on YouTube, respectively.\n\nIdeally, you want to target terms with a high search volume and low competition. Because they’ll help drive the most traffic to your channel. \n\nTo look at trending topics, switch to the “Fast growing keywords” tab.\n\nOr switch to “Most viewed videos” to see popular content and feel inspired.\n\nBased on your research, make a list of keywords to target. Use these in your channel description and to optimize other parts of your channel and improve your YouTube SEO.\n\nFor example, add your target keywords to video titles, descriptions, tags, and transcripts.\n\nYou can find the Keyword Analytics for YouTube app in the Semrush App Center. \n\nFurther reading: YouTube Keyword Research: How to Find Popular Search Terms\n\nCreate an Engaging Channel Trailer\n\nChannel trailers play automatically when a potential subscriber lands on your channel, which encourages people to engage further with your content.\n\nCreate a short video that promotes your YouTube channel and tells people what they can expect from your videos, business, or product.\n\nHere are a few channel trailer best practices:\n\nAim for between 30-90 seconds in length: Leave your audience wanting more and entice them to join your channel\nHook your audience in the first few seconds: For example, tease exciting video content or ask an engaging question\nAppeal to your target audience: Show your expertise, use a personal story, or share your channel’s core goals\nMake sure it’s engaging: For example, use fast cuts, bright colors, and engaging text\nShowcase your best content: Show your audience a taste of what they can expect from your channel\n\nCheck out this trailer example from Dropbox, which appears on their channel page. They’ve used the format to show channel visitors what they can expect from the product:\n\nBuild Playlists\n\nHigh-quality, closely related video playlists encourage people to keep watching your content. Which means there are more opportunities for viewers to subscribe.\n\nYouTube playlists also keep your channel organized and less cluttered. This creates a more professional appearance, which helps your brand appear more trustworthy.\n\nHere’s a playlist example from Jamie Oliver, a well-known U.K. chef, who uses a playlist on his channel that collects all his child-friendly videos together:\n\nBecause playlists are a group of videos that cover the same topic or are related in some other way, they’re helpful if you release videos in a series. \n\nOr want to group similar videos, like podcast episodes, modules of a course, or a narrative around a product launch.\n\nPlaylists also keep audiences on your channel longer. This improves watch time, a metric YouTube uses within its algorithms to determine where and when to show videos to viewers on the platform.\n\n2. Upload Consistent, Effective Branding\n\nMaintaining a consistent brand identity helps customers identify, understand, and remember your brand. Which can help grow your YouTube subscriber count.\n\nUpload the following to effectively brand your YouTube channel:\n\nProfile Picture\n\nA YouTube channel profile picture needs to show who you are and what your channel is about.\n\nThis helps viewers recognize your brand and build affinity with it.\n\nIf the channel is for your business, use a company logo. If you’re a solo creator, you could use an image of your face or product. \n\nHere’s an example from the fashion magazine Vogue:\n\nBanner Image\n\nA banner image is a visual opportunity to show potential subscribers what your channel is about and who runs it. \n\nYou can also use this space to show a promotion or latest product launch. \n\nFor example, Spotify uses its banner image to promote the popular end-of-year wrapped lists:\n\nBrand Watermark\n\nBrand watermarks help people recognize who made the video they’re watching. Which helps them become familiar with your brand and builds trust.\n\nPlus, a subscribe button appears when you hover your mouse over the watermark. Helping you quickly and easily grow your subscriber count. \n\nHere’s how we include a brand watermark at Semrush:\n\nThumbnails\n\nAn engaging thumbnail can lead to more video views. Which helps drive engagement and generate subscribers for your channel.\n\nCreate visually appealing thumbnails to capture audience attention in YouTube search results. \n\nThink about creative elements (e.g., text, image, etc) to include that will help you stand out from the crowd.\n\nHere’s an example thumbnail from chef Kenji López-Alt:\n\nWhy it works:\n\nBright, bold text highlights the video content\nIt includes a high-quality image of the finished product \nThe image is well-framed and engaging\nIt includes the name of the creator to improve brand awareness\n\nNotice how Kenji keeps his branding consistent across all his thumbnails? \n\nThis makes his channel more recognizable and it appears more professional. Which helps convert casual browsers into subscribers.\n\n3. Post High-Quality, Engaging Videos\n\nCreating as much content as possible on YouTube might be tempting—the hope being that something sticks, gains popularity, and wins you subscribers. \n\nBut this shouldn’t be the approach you take.\n\nAlways focus on quality over quantity. You’ll only get more YouTube subscribers if viewers find your content valuable—no matter how much you produce.\n\nHere’s how to create high-quality YouTube videos that grow your subscriber count:\n\nUnderstand Your Target Audience\n\nUnderstand your target audience and the topics that interest them to create YouTube videos that meet their needs and interests. This helps you provide value, which creates engagement and generates subscriber growth.\n\nFor example, we learn that our pizza cooking channel’s target audience is interested in craft beer, has a modest income, and is mainly located on the West Coast of the United States.\n\nWe then tailor our video content to appeal to this group of people to drive more views, engagement, and subscribers.\n\nWhat’s one of the best ways to understand your target audience? \n\nLook at your direct competitors to get insights into their audience, as it’s likely a similar audience to your own.\n\nUse Semrush’s One2Target tool to examine demographic, socioeconomic, and psychographic data.\n\nOpen the tool, enter your competitor’s domain, and click “Analyze.”\n\nThe next screen provides an overview of your competitor's target audience. \n\nThe “Demographics” tab shows a breakdown of their audience by age, sex, and location. \n\nClick the “Socioeconomics” tab to view data about household size, household income, education level, and employment status.\n\nThe “Behavior” tab tells you about your competitor’s audience’s interests, device type, and most-used social media platforms.\n\nYou can use this data to inform your own YouTube content strategy and drive subscriber growth.\n\nUnderstand Your Target Audience\n\nwith the One2Target Tool\n\nLearn More →\nInclude Calls to Action\n\nInclude a call to action encouraging viewers to stay on your channel and engage more with your content. \n\nFor example, at the end of your video, share a playlist or video recommendation for them to watch. Or simply ask them to subscribe to your channel for more content.\n\nAlso, consider using end screens to grow your subscribers.\n\nThese appear at the end of your video and present the viewer with a button to subscribe, along with other CTAs. For example, to watch more videos or visit a website.\n\nHere’s an end screen example from the New York Times Cooking channel that encourages viewers to subscribe:\n\n4. Build Engagement with Your Content\n\nEngagement is one of the most important aspects of getting YouTube subscribers.\n\nEngagement is a key part of the YouTube algorithm and, therefore vital to get your videos in front of a wider audience. \n\nOne easy way to build engagement is to reply to comments.\n\nIf someone has taken the time to comment on your video, send them a reply to help them feel like part of your community. \n\nEngagement also signals to YouTube that your content is valuable. And this can impact how frequently your video is shown to other users, further helping grow your subscriber base. \n\nHere’s an example by social media fitness company Strava:\n\n5. Promote Your Videos\n\nYou can drive subscribers to your YouTube channel from other places—sometimes even off the YouTube platform itself. \n\nHere are a few ways to do this:\n\nShare Videos in Online Communities\n\nYou can share relevant video content in online groups or communities to get your channel in front of potential new subscribers. And grow your community, too.\n\nLook at Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups, Reddit, or other digital communities for niche topics that relate to your channel. \n\nFor example, if your YouTube channel is about pizza, browse Facebook for pizza-making groups and share your content there. This could get you in front of an audience that might not find you through YouTube’s algorithm.\n\nBut don’t spam channels or post excessively. Each contribution is a representation of your brand. So, make sure you share content that’s relevant to the broader conversation and provides value.\n\nPromote Your Channel to Your Existing Audience\n\nYou can also leverage your existing audience on other platforms to get more YouTube subscribers.\n\nFor example, share videos across other social channels to encourage views and subscribers from audiences connected with you on other platforms.\n\nOr announce your channel and share videos in a newsletter.\n\nYou can also embed your videos in blog posts and email campaigns to encourage views, clicks, and subscribers.\n\nCollaborate with Other YouTubers\n\nWant to get your channel in front of a new audience to drive subscriber growth? Consider collaborating with other YouTubers.\n\nEnsure your collaborator is both compatible with your business and not a competitor before planning your campaign.\n\nFor example, it doesn’t make sense for a pizza-themed channel to collaborate with a dog-grooming channel. Because each audience is too different, the collaboration won’t provide value.\n\nAfter you’ve sourced a collaborator, appear in each other's videos. Then, use cards and mentions in the content to direct the viewer from one channel to the other. \n\nThis helps introduce your channel to a new audience likely interested in your content. Which can help grow your subscribers.\n\n6. Monitor Key YouTube Metrics\n\nKnowing the types of YouTube videos that drive views, engagement, and subscribers will help you grow your channel even faster.\n\nBut when you create and share many different videos, how do you know which ones achieve results and grow your YouTube subscribers?\n\nLook at your analytics.\n\nYouTube has built-in analytics that helps you understand what’s working and what isn’t in your videos. \n\nThis means you can make content creation decisions backed by data. Which helps grow your channel faster.\n\nThere are three principal metrics to keep track of on YouTube: \n\nAudience retention\nWatch time\nRankings\nAudience Retention\n\nAudience retention indicates when people stop watching your video. This allows you to analyze why this might be the case.\n\nConsider why viewers didn’t watch to the end by asking yourself these questions:\n\nDid you answer the question they searched for? \nWas the content engaging enough?\nIs the video too long?\nWhat happened halfway through the video that might make viewers want to click away? \nDid you introduce a CTA and an opportunity to click off the video too soon? (This might not be a bad thing if it leads to conversions.)\n\nThen, use this information to create better videos next time. \n\nTo measure audience retention, head to your channel dashboard. Then click “Content.”\n\nChoose the video that you’d like to review data on. Click “Analytics,” then scroll down to “Key moments for audience retention.”\n\nWatch Time\n\nYouTube also uses watch time as a factor within its ranking algorithms. So, you need to measure and look for opportunities to increase this metric to help boost the visibility of your videos. \n\nThe watch time metric measures the total time people spend watching your videos on YouTube.\n\nYou need 4,000 hours of watch time within the past 12 months to become eligible for the YouTube Partner Program. And to start earning revenue from your channel through ads. \n\nNote\n\nIf you’re using Shorts, you need 10 million views on them within the past 90 days.\n\nHere are a few ideas to increase your watch time metric:\n\nCreate evergreen content rather than only relying on trending topics\nUse catchy titles and thumbnails\nStick to a consistent posting schedule\nBuild playlists\n\nTo measure watch time, select the “Watch time (hours)” tab found in each video’s analytics. \n\nYou can also find your channel’s overall watch time in the “Overview” tab.\n\nRankings\n\nMonitoring your rankings in YouTube search results indicates how well your keyword strategy is working. And provide insights on the overall quality of your content.\n\nTo see where your videos rank in YouTube search results, use Rank Tracker for YouTube. \n\nStart by importing your keywords. Enter them manually or import them from YouTube Studio or Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder tool. Then click “Import Keywords.”\n\nOnce you complete the setup, click on the “Overview” tab.\n\nHere, you’ll find the following data for the previous week:\n\nYour average ranking for all target keywords\nYour keyword ranking distribution (Top 3, Top 10, Top 20, or No Rank)\nHow many rankings have increased, decreased, and stayed the same\n\nClick the “Keywords” tab to see your ranking for each target keyword.\n\nPlus:\n\nHow this ranking has changed over the past week\nThe title of the ranking video (if you rank in the top 20)\nThe average monthly search volume for the target keyword\n\nTo analyze the main competition for any keyword, click “Preview” in the “YouTube results” column.\n\nHere you’ll see the ranking, thumbnail, duration, title, and publish date for the top 20 videos.\n\nAnd which channels published them and how many views they have.\n\nYou can find the Rank Tracker for YouTube in the Semrush App Center.\n\nTo truly understand how your brand's videos are performing and where you stand compared to competitors, Semrush's Social Tracker with the YouTube Report is your go-to tool. It goes beyond basic metrics, giving you deep insights into audience growth, engagement levels (likes, dislikes, comments), and even how often your competitors are posting.\n\nUse the YouTube Report to uncover your competitors’ most engaging videos, identify trends in your niche, and pinpoint opportunities to boost your own video strategy. By understanding what resonates with your audience and how your competitors are reaching them, you can create content that truly stands out.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Getting YouTube Subscribers\nHow Many Subscribers Do You Need to Get Paid on YouTube?\n\nTo monetize a YouTube channel with ads, you need 1,000 subscribers and either 4,000 public watch hours on long-form videos in the past 12 months or 10 million public YouTube Shorts views in the past 90 days.\n\nHow Do You Get Monetized on YouTube Without 1,000 Subscribers?\n\nTo monetize YouTube without 1,000 subscribers, you still need at least 500 subscribers. This way, you can run channel memberships, promote your own products with YouTube Shopping, and access various other features.\n\nBut to unlock the ability to earn money from ads and YouTube Premium, you need 1,000 subscribers.\n\nHow Do You See Your YouTube Subscribers?\n\nTo check the number of subscribers your YouTube channel has, follow these steps:\n\nLog in to YouTube Studio and click “Analytics.”\n\nThen, on the “Overview” tab, click “Subscribers.”\n\nOn the “Subscribers” tab, you can see the number of subscribers and the growth of your subscribers.\n\nHow Do I Become a YouTube Partner?\n\nAny channel owner can join the YouTube Partner Program—as long as they meet the following criteria, as outlined by Google:\n\nFollow YouTube channel monetization policies\nLive in a country/region where the YouTube Partner Program is available\nHave no active Community Guidelines strikes on your channel\nEnsure 2-Step Verification is turned on for your Google Account\nHave advanced features access on YouTube\nHave one active AdSense account that you’ll link to your channel (or be ready to set one up)\n\nThen, once you have 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time (or 10 million Shorts views), your channel can become eligible for the YouTube Partner Program with either Shorts or long-form videos.\n\nCan I Buy YouTube Subscribers?\n\nWe don’t recommend buying YouTube subscribers.\n\nIt’s a risky strategy that could get your account suspended or banned. Because buying subscribers goes against YouTube’s terms of service.\n\nHow to Get More YouTube Subscribers with Semrush\n\nReady to make strategic decisions about the future of your YouTube channel? \n\nUse the Semrush suite of tools, including Keyword Analytics for YouTube and Rank Tracker for YouTube, to create video content that grows your audience and gets you more subscribers.\n\nAccess Everything You Need\n\nin One Platform with Semrush\n\nGet a FREE Trial →",
