  "content": "What Is SEO for Financial Services?\n\nSEO for financial services is the process of trying to improve a financial service company’s organic (unpaid) visibility in search engines like Google. With the ultimate goal of attracting more clients.\n\nIn other words, it’s SEO (search engine optimization) tailored to the finance industry.\n\nIt can help your business’s website and/or location appear prominently when people search relevant keywords.\n\nLike this:\n\nThis visibility can help you get more brand awareness and organic traffic.\n\nAs for specific tasks, financial services SEO typically involves:\n\nPublishing quality content around relevant keywords\nEnsuring your website delivers a great user experience\nMaking your website accessible to search engine bots\nImproving your brand’s online reputation and prominence\nCreating Google profiles for your business locations (where relevant)\n\nTip\n\nClaim your free Semrush trial to follow along with the tutorials in this guide. \n\nWhy Does SEO Matter in Financial Services?\n\nSEO matters in financial services because search engines drive 2.2 billion organic visits to websites in the finance industry each month, according to our Market Explorer tool.\n\nIt can also generate brand awareness, foot traffic, and concrete business results for your financial services company.\n\nTo get a bigger slice of these benefits, you need a good SEO strategy.\n\nOtherwise, you’re likely to lose out to your competitors.\n\nPlus, financial services SEO is primarily about making your website better for users. Those visitors may be more likely to become clients—whether they come to your site from a search engine or somewhere else.\n\nHow to Do SEO for Financial Services\n\nHere’s how to get started with SEO for financial services companies:\n\n1. Conduct Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research is the process of finding and analyzing search terms your target audience uses that are relevant to your business.\n\nIt helps you figure out what kind of content to create. And how to optimize it.\n\nTo get started, go to Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nEnter a broad term related to your business offering or expertise. Then, add your domain, choose your target country, and click “Search.”\n\nThe tool finds “Broad Match” keywords that contain your starting term or a close variation. \n\nAnd presents a variety of useful keyword metrics.\n\n“Volume” refers to the average number of monthly searches the keyword gets.\n\nHigher-volume keywords have more potential reach. But tend to attract more competition from other websites.\n\nThat’s why it’s important to consider volume alongside Personal Keyword Difficulty (PKD%). Which indicates how hard it’ll be for your website to achieve a top-10 organic position/ranking in search results. \n\nAlso pay attention to the “Intent” column.\n\nThis shows the type(s) of search intent behind the keyword—i.e., the general purpose behind each respective search.\n\nType\n\n\t\n\nUser intent\n\n\t\n\nKeyword Example\n\n\n\n\nInformational (I)\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to find general information\n\n\t\n\n“what is apr on a credit card”\n\n\n\n\nCommercial (C)\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to research products, services, or brands\n\n\t\n\n“best credit cards”\n\n\n\n\nNavigational (N)\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to go to a specific website or webpage\n\n\t\n\n“chase credit card login”\n\n\n\n\nTransactional (T)\n\n\t\n\nThe user wants to perform an action (e.g., make a purchase)\n\n\t\n\n“apply for amazon credit card”\n\nFor a better understanding of a term’s search intent, click the icon in the “SF” column.\n\nThis allows you to review the search engine results page (SERP). And see what kinds of content perform well.\n\nYou’ll want to do this for every keyword you’re considering. So you have an idea of what searchers are looking for before you start writing. \n\nThen, use the checkboxes and “+ Add to keyword list” button to save keywords you want to target. \n\n(Or use the individual “+” buttons.)\n\nElevate Your SEO Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\n2. Create High-Quality Content\n\nTo give yourself the best chance of ranking prominently for your target keywords (the terms you selected in the last step), create quality content that:\n\nSatisfies search intent better than competing content does\nDelivers a great user experience\nDemonstrates Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T)\n\nE-E-A-T is a framework Google reviewers follow when evaluating the quality of content that appears in search results. So they can provide feedback aimed at improving the search experience. \n\nAnd it’s particularly important in financial services SEO. Because finance is a Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) topic. \n\nIn other words, you could cause harm to users by providing inaccurate or misleading information.\n\nOne way to establish trust is to have financial experts create or review your content. And display their credentials.\n\nLike JP Morgan does:\n\nAnd always make sure your content is well-researched. \n\nSharing methodologies and sources helps prove that your content is reliable.\n\nWhen doing SEO marketing for financial services, also be conscious of readability. Because the finance industry uses lots of technical terms that audiences may be unfamiliar with. \n\nUse clear explanations, short sentences, and plain language to make your content more accessible. And build better relationships with your readers.\n\nTip\n\nUse the SEO Writing Assistant to check your content’s readability and tone of voice as you write.\n \n\n3. Follow On-Page SEO Best Practices\n\nOn-page SEO is about making your webpages more search engine-friendly.\n\nFirst, use your keywords strategically. So search engines (and users) understand your content is relevant.\n\nWhere natural, incorporate them into these elements:\n\nHeading tags: The main on-page heading (H1 tag) and any subheadings (H2s, H3s, etc.)\nTitle tag: The HTML page title that can appear in SERPs\nURL slug: The unique part of the webpage address\nAlt text: Image descriptions provided for SEO and accessibility purposes\nBody content: The main written content on the page\n\nYou should also write a meta description for each page.\n\nThis is a page summary that can appear in the SERP (underneath the title that’s displayed). So, your main goal in crafting one is encouraging users to click through.\n\nSome other best practices include:\n\nAdding internal links to relevant pages on your site (making sure to use descriptive anchor text)\nUsing schema markup (code that provides contextual information about your content) to help search engines understand and categorize different types of data on your page\n\nYou can get tailored recommendations for your existing content with Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker.\n\nIt provides optimization ideas based on SEO best practices. And an analysis of your top-ranking competitors.\n\n4. Run a Technical SEO Audit\n\nRun a technical SEO audit to see if your site has any technical issues that could hold its rankings back. Because even exceptional content can fail to gain visibility if you have these types of issues.\n\nWith Semrush’s Site Audit tool, you can check for problems relating to:\n\nCrawling and indexing: Processes that search engines use to find your content and make it available in search results\nCore Web Vitals: Metrics that Google uses to evaluate page experience (e.g., how quickly your main content loads)\nHTTPS: A security protocol Google recommends\n\nAnd much more.\n\nWhen your first audit is ready, go to the “Issues” report. To see a list of Errors (high priority), Warnings (medium priority), and Notices (low priority).\n\nYou can get advice on why and how to fix each one. Please note you may need to work with a developer for some of them.\n\nOnce you’ve addressed your issues, re-run the audit to see if you’ve successfully fixed them.\n\nYou should see your Site Health score improve.\n\nElevate Your SEO Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\n5. Optimize for Local SEO (If Relevant)\n\nLocal SEO is important if you serve clients in a particular area. Because it helps your business show up in location-based search results. \n\nLike this:\n\nThe most important tactic is listing your business (or individual locations) through Google Business Profile.\n\nBecause Google uses these profiles to populate map-based results.\n\nTo maximize your profile’s visibility, you should:\n\nComplete the verification process\nProvide complete business information (and keep it updated)\nUse local keywords in your business description\nTry to collect positive reviews from clients\nRespond to reviews quickly and tactfully\nConsider posting updates about events, deals, news, etc.\n\nIt’s also helpful to get listed on other reputable directories. Because it makes your business more findable. And may improve Google’s perception of your business.\n\nHead over to the Listing Management tool to check whether you’re listed in prominent directories. And whether the information is accurate.\n\nIf not, consider signing up for a plan.\n\nAs a subscriber, you can update all your listings at once. And access a variety of other local SEO tools.\n\n6. Build Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are links on other websites that point to your website.\n\nIf you have backlinks from reputable and relevant websites, Google may perceive your site to be more trustworthy and authoritative. \n\nAnd that can translate to better rankings.\n\nFor example, Chase Bank has backlinks from thousands of finance sites. According to Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool:\n\nThe process of trying to acquire valuable backlinks is called link building. \n\nAnd there are many tactics you can use, including:\n\nLink baiting: Create content that people naturally want to link to. For example, a financial report containing statistics that journalists want to cite. Or a free mortgage calculator tool that money bloggers can direct their readers to.\nSkyscraper technique: Create a better version of a widely linked resource in your niche—then try to inherit its links. For example, one of Chase’s most-linked pages is a home value estimator. So, you might try to create a better version and encourage people to link to yours instead.\nEmail outreach: Find writers who may be interested in linking to your content (e.g., because you have data that could add value to their article). And email them with your proposal.\nUnlinked mentions: Use the Media Monitoring app to find unlinked mentions (instances where people refer to your brand without linking) on the web. Then, get in touch with the writer and ask them to add a link. \nBroken link building: Use the Backlink Analytics tool to find broken backlinks to your own or competitors’ websites. Then, try to get them replaced with functional links to your website.\nMedia requests: Use a tool like Connectively to find and respond to relevant media requests (e.g., journalists might request expert commentary about the latest inflation figures). If your submission is used, you’re likely to receive a backlink as attribution.\n\nTip\n\nUse Semrush’s Link Building Tool to streamline the outreach process. It helps you identify relevant contacts, track your outreach emails, and monitor acquired backlinks.\n \n\n7. Track Your Results\n\nMonitor your SEO results so you can invest more in the projects that work. And avoid or adapt the ones that don’t.\n\nHere’s your quick guide to the most important metrics:\n\nMetric\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nWhere to Track\n\n\n\n\nOrganic traffic\n\n\t\n\nUnpaid visits from search engines\n\n\t\n\nGoogle Analytics 4\n\n\n\n\nOrganic conversions\n\n\t\n\nConversions (e.g., form submissions) resulting from organic traffic\n\n\t\n\nGoogle Analytics 4\n\n\n\n\nOrganic keyword rankings\n\n\t\n\nYour positions for target keywords in Google\n\n\t\n\nPosition Tracking (Semrush)\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Maps rankings\n\n\t\n\nYour business profile’s visibility in Google Maps results\n\n\t\n\nMap Rank Tracker (Semrush Local)\n\n\n\n\nAuthority Score\n\n\t\n\nA measure of your website’s ranking strength, based largely on backlinks\n\n\t\n\nBacklink Audit (Semrush)\n\n\n\n\nSite Health\n\n\t\n\nA measure of your site’s technical and on-page SEO health\n\n\t\n\nSite Audit (Semrush)\n\nYou can access these Semrush tools and many others with your free Semrush trial.\n\nSign up now to start building your SEO for financial services strategy.\n\nElevate Your SEO Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
