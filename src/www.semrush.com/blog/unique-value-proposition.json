  "content": "What Is a Unique Value Proposition\n\nA unique value proposition (also called a UVP or value prop) is a clear statement that communicates the value of your product or service. It describes the benefits of your offer, how it solves customers’ problems, and why it’s different from other options.\n\nYour UVP meaning is your answer to a simple question: why should a customer choose you over your competitors?\n\nThe unique value proposition for Semrush for Agencies appears on this landing page:\n\nCustomers typically compare several products or services before they decide on one.\n\nYour UVP sets you apart from the competition.\n\nIt should be the first thing a visitor sees on your website homepage, product pages, and landing pages. And a cornerstone of your marketing campaigns.\n\nA Unique Value Proposition Is Not a Mission Statement or Tagline\n\nA UVP tells customers what you offer and why they should choose you. Mission statements and taglines influence customers in a similar way.\n\nBut there’s a difference in how they work compared to a value proposition.\n\nA mission statement is your purpose for being. It describes your business goal.\n\nFor example, here’s Nike’s mission statement:\n\n“To bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.”\n\nA tagline (or slogan) is a short, memorable line that captures the idea of your brand:\n\nHere’s Nike’s tagline:\n\n“Just Do It”\n\nMission statements and taglines are important marketing messages for your business, but they aren’t interchangeable with your value prop.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause a value prop is a concrete statement related to your product or service.\n\nHere’s Nike’s value proposition for its custom shoe range:\n\n“Your personal Nike co-creation starts here. Make something they’ve never seen before by creating your own iconic sneakers with Nike By You.”\n\nThis UVP is specific to the product. It tells customers what makes Nike By You offer the perfect solution for their current need in a way that a mission statement or tagline can’t.\n\nIn short:\n\nMission statement = business goal\nTagline = brand essence or idea\nValue prop = product or service value\nUnique Value Proposition vs. Unique Selling Proposition\n\nUnique value propositions and unique selling propositions (USPs) are often used interchangeably.  \n\nBut there’s a difference:\n\nA unique selling proposition describes what makes you stand out\nA unique value proposition explains why customers should care and what they get out of it\n\nHere’s Robinhood’s USP:\n\n“Investing for everyone.”\n\nRobinhood is an investing platform that’s built for inclusiveness—no matter your level of investing experience. Its USP sells that benefit.\n\nNow, here’s its UVP:\n\n“Build your portfolio starting with just $1. Invest in stocks, options, and ETFs at your pace and commission-free.”\n\nThe UVP helps customers see the tangible value of the product.\n\nBecause a unique selling point captures what’s special about your product, you can use it to craft a value prop.\n\nFor example, Robinhood’s UVP headline “build your portfolio starting with just $1” informs its USP. $1 is a low barrier to entry. It’s another way of saying “investing for everyone.”\n\nBoth unique selling points and value props should feature prominently in your marketing strategy.\n\nYou can use USPs to pique your audience’s interest. UVPs encourage potential customers to act on their interest.\n\nWhat Does a Great Unique Value Proposition Look Like?\n\nA compelling value proposition:\n\nIs concise and easy to understand\nIs memorable\nTells a customer what they’ll get from buying your product or service\nExplains how your offer is different from the alternatives\n\nTo immediately communicate value to the reader, a UVP typically has three main elements:\n\nAn attention-grabbing headline that explains the main benefit\nA subheadline, paragraph, or bullet points that explain what you offer and why it’s useful\nAn image, graphic, or video that shows the product or service and reinforces the message\n\nTrello’s homepage demonstrates what a strong value proposition looks like:\n\nHere’s why it works:\n\nThe headline is a clear statement about what Trello does and who it’s for\nThe subheading states how Trello helps remote teams stay organized\nA relevant image shows teams collaborating\n\nIn 20 words, Trello sells the value of its platform by telling people that they can manage multiple projects in one place.\n\nIt solves the problem of teams having to communicate across different channels and the various challenges that come with it (e.g., missed deadlines, prolonged tasks, endless email chains).\n\nA good UVP might also include an additional selling point to win a customer over. These are small things that make an offer a little bit more attractive.\n\nIn the above example, Trello adds “Sign up – it’s free” in its call-to-action (CTA). “It’s free” is a valuable add-on for budget-conscious customers.\n\nOther common selling points include:\n\nFree shipping\nNext-day delivery\nNo contract\nCancel any time\nBuy now and save\n\nThese elements can tip the scales in your favor and convince a customer to choose you over a competitor.\n\nTypes of Unique Value Proposition\n\nUnique value propositions typically fall into one of four themes:\n\nBest value product or service\nBest quality product or service\nMost luxurious product\nStaple (must-have) product\n\nThese themes reflect buyer motivations. People often purchase based on one or more of the following:\n\nBang for the buck: They want the best quality-to-price ratio possible.\nReputation: They want the market leader or company with a proven track record.\nStatus: They want a product or service that signifies luxury.\nNecessity: The product is a must-have (e.g., a pipe wrench is essential for a plumber).\n\nA great value prop delivers what customers value most by focusing on these factors.\n\nFor example, Slack’s value prop plays on its reputation as a leader in business messaging platforms:\n\n“Slack is the platform that companies trust and people love to use.”\n\nIts rival, Chanty, focuses on bang for the buck:\n\n“Join Chanty – easy-to-use team collaboration tool. Get secure unlimited messaging free forever.”\n\nBoth tap into what customers want. Slack’s customers want the market leader. Chanty’s customers want an affordable alternative to Slack.\n\nBefore you work on your value proposition, be clear on what you want to deliver to customers.\n\nAre your products and services more affordable than the competition?\nAre you a more well-known brand?\nDo you offer luxury products or services?\nDo you offer products and services that customers can’t live without?\n\nSemrush’s Market Explorer tool can help you find where you fit in your target market by curating insights on your competition.\n\nClick “Find Competitors.” Then, enter your website URL and hit “Research a market.” \n\nThe tool generates a list of the major brands in your industry. \n\nThe “Overview” tab shows you who your biggest competitors are. It also visualizes their market share, audience behavior, and growth rate.\n\nFor now, all you need are names. Manually search for more details about the players who occupy the same space:\n\nHow do they position themselves?\nWhat benefits does their UVP focus on?\nHow do your products or services compare to theirs?\n\nThis initial research will give you an idea of what your UVP needs to get across.\n\nThe next step is to dig deeper into customer needs and how you meet them.\n\nHow to Create Your Unique Value Proposition\n\nFor your value prop to hit the mark, you have a deep understanding of your audience, your offering, and how your product or service fits into the customer’s world.\n\nDon’t write a UVP based on what you think you know. Base it on research and testing so you’re sure it will attract your target audience.\n\nHere’s how to develop your unique value proposition:\n\nConduct Customer Analysis to Find Key Pain Points\n\nCustomer analysis involves using data to understand your audience’s pain points, wants, and needs.\n\nIf you know what makes your customers tick, you can craft a UVP that speaks their language.\n\nTo get started, pick 5-10 of your most loyal customers from your CRM (customer relationship management) platform to survey or interview.\n\nIf you don’t have many (or any) customers yet, you can find people to interview by:\n\nAsking members of relevant groups on Facebook, LinkedIn, or niche forums\nReaching out to social media followers or people who engage with your competitors\nAttending industry networking events\nPartnering with a market research company\n\nAsk participants questions related to their buying motivations. For example:\n\nWhat are the main issues you face with X?\nWhat did/do you look for in X?\nWhat did/do you want X to help you achieve?\nDo you prefer X over Y? Why is this? \nHow much would you pay for X?\n\nSupplement your surveys or interviews with customer feedback. Look at:\n\nCustomer reviews\nBrand mentions on social media\nSocial media messages\nCustomer support requests\n\nThese sources are all valuable in understanding your audience’s pain points and goals.\n\nLook for common themes in your research. If you spot the same needs, problems, and motivations popping up, you can address them in your value prop.\n\nLearn how to perform market and customer research step by step in the following guides:\n\nThe Complete Guide to (Effective) Customer Analysis\nMarket Research: What It Is & How to Do It\nHow to Create an Ideal Customer Profile Template\nFind What Differentiates Your Product or Service\n\nYour differentiators are the distinct and unique value that sets you apart from the competition. They’re the reasons for customers to choose you over a rival.\n\nTo find your differentiators, ask yourself: What does my product or service do better than anyone else?\n\nWrite down specific benefits that customers find valuable about your product or service.\n\nThis might be your materials, product functionality, customer service, or price. Your customer research will help with this task.\n\nApple, for example, lists its design philosophy and closed product ecosystem as differentiators.\n\nThese help Apple’s products feel more exclusive and premium than Android smartphones, where multiple brands share the same software.\n\nAs you make your list, be careful not to include qualities that others can copy.\n\nFor example, “free shipping” is a positive and powerful add-on to your UVP. But it doesn’t differentiate you.\n\nWhen you have your list, create a competitor comparison chart to rank your strengths against others. \n\nA comparison chart is as simple as a side-by-side list. You can expand this to include several competitors. For example, this simple chart compares five competitors in the categories of organic search, paid search, and local search. \n\nUse the Market Explorer tool to find 3-5 competitors in your space. Write down how each product or service solves a pain point for customers.\n\nCross off anything on your list that your rivals also claim to offer.\n\nWhatever’s left on your list after this exercise is a differentiator. And a competitive advantage to highlight in your UVP.\n\nMap Out a Value Proposition Canvas\n\nA value proposition canvas explores the components of your company that contribute to a strong UVP.\n\nIt’s designed to help you gain clarity about the value of your product or service and how it fits with what the customer wants.\n\nThe below template has two main sections: customer profile and value proposition map:\n\nStart with the customer profile. You can use what you’ve gathered from your customer analysis to complete this section.\n\nGains: What do customers expect and need from you to buy your product or service?\nCustomer jobs: What task does your customer need to complete, or what problem do they want to solve, with your product or service?\nPains: What negative experiences or risks does a customer have when trying to solve their problems?\n\nNow move on to the value proposition map. This describes what your product or service offers the customer:\n\nGain creators: What features and benefits give your customers value and make them happy?\nPain relievers: How does your product or service help customers overcome their pains?\nProducts and services: What products and services do you offer that create the biggest gains and ease the most pain for your customers?\n\nOrganize elements by notating whether they’re “nice-to-have” or “must-have.”\n\nFor example, if you run an online coffee brand, coffee subscriptions are a “must-have.” These help customers get the type and amount of coffee they need.\n\nBranded mugs are “nice to have.” They make customers happy, but they’re not essential to the core product.\n\nWhen the value proposition map addresses the biggest pains and gains in the customer profile, you have a fit.\n\nWrite Your Unique Value Proposition\n\nNow you’re clear on how you stand out from the competition, you can brainstorm ideas to find a unique value proposition.\n\nTo distil your insights into a concise statement, follow a unique value propositiontemplate like the Steve Blank formula:\n\n“We help (X) do (Y) by doing (Z).”\n\nThis formula helps you emphasize benefits over features to appeal to your audience and their wants and needs.\n\nFor example, a unique value proposition for a web design agency might be:\n\n“We help small business owners grow their audience with attractive, affordable websites.”\n\nAlternatively, you can try Geoffrey Moore’s value positioning statement. \n\nIntroduced in his book “Crossing the Chasm,” Fortune 500 companies use his formula to create their UVP by getting specific on industry, category, and value:\n\n“For (target customer) who (need or opportunity), our (product/service name) is (product category) that (benefit).”\n\nUsing this method, a value prop for a web design agency might be:\n\n“For small businesses who want to grow online, Rockstar Websites is an ecommerce platform that lets you turn visitors into customers without technical expertise.”\n\nSteve Blank’s formula might inspire a compelling headline, while Geoff Moore’s method might help you come up with important benefits for a subheading.\n\nBut this is a creative exercise. So don’t worry if you don’t strictly follow each template.\n\nThe idea is to use them to articulate your value prop and spark creativity.\n\nTest Your Unique Value Proposition with a Small Audience\n\nThe true test of a UVP is in your target audience’s reaction. Testing gives you valuable insights into what resonates and what needs to improve in order to optimize your conversion rate.\n\nTo do it, you’ll need to show your value proposition statement to your target audience.\n\nReturn to the customers you interviewed to get their feedback or use a tool like Wynter to put your message in front of your target demographic.\n\nFind out if:\n\nThey find the message clear\nThey find the message relevant\nThey want the value promised\nThey want to choose you over an alternative\n\nAnother good way to test your value prop is to create two options and split test them.\n\nA split test (also called an A/B test) works by showing 50% of a test audience version A (your original UVP), and 50% version B (a modified UVP).\n\nModifications might include tweaks to your headline, subheading, value add-ons, or image.\n\nThe version that produces the best results (clicks, leads, phone calls, purchases, etc.) wins.\n\nSay you test two versions of your UVP on different landing pages and more people engage with version B. That’s the value prop to move forward with.\n\nTo get started with split testing, check out the following guides:\n\nSplit Testing: What It Is & How to Do It\nWhat Is A/B Testing? When to Run an A/B Test and Why\n7 Effective Value Proposition Examples\n\nOne of the best ways you can learn about what makes a strong UVP is by analyzing examples.\n\nHere are seven great value props and why they work:\n\n1. Evernote\n\nWhy it works:\n\nClearly explains the main benefit of Evernote (“organize your life”)\nSubheading solves customer pain points (“remember everything,” “all in one place”)\nStrong product image\n2. Grammarly\n\nWhy it works:\n\nClear and concise explanation of what the product helps customers do\nVideo shows how Grammarly works\nGood use of selling point add-on (“Get Grammarly. It’s free”)\n3. Stripe\n\nWhy it works:\n\nHeadline makes it clear what the product is and who it’s for\nStrong benefit-led subheading\nPositions Stripe as an authority (“Millions of businesses of all sizes” use Stripe)\n4. Uber\n\nWhy it works:\n\nUVP is concise and value-led\nHeadline suggests customers can earn money quickly and easily\nSubheadline assures Uber drivers of work (“largest network of active passengers.”)\n5. WordPress\n\nWhy it works:\n\nHeadline positions WordPress as the best choice (“The world’s most popular…”)\nSubheader adds context to the headline to build trust\nUse of social proof adds authority (“43% of the web is built on WordPress.”)\n6. Mailchimp\n\nWhy it works:\n\nValue-focused headline sells the main benefit\nSubheader tells customers what they can achieve\nUVP positions Mailchimp as the market leader\n7. EveryPlate\n\nWhy it works:\n\nHeadline shows EveryPlate’s authority and status (“America’s Best Value Meal Kit”)\nSubheader meets a customer need (avoid trips to the store, save time in the kitchen)\nRelevant image shows the product package, contents, and end result\nValue Propositions Evolve with Your Customers\n\nA great value proposition appeals to what customers want or need at the time.\n\nBut objectives can change as markets shift and your business evolves. So it’s important to revisit your value props.\n\nListen to your customers. Make a habit of gathering feedback about your product or service. Try a template like Strategyzer’s Value Proposition Canvas.\n\nAnd use Semrush’s Market Explorer to monitor your competition and market position.\n\nPrioritize insights over assumptions. The more you know, the easier it is to create unique value propositions that make your brand the best choice.",
