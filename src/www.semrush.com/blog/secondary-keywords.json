  "content": "What Are Secondary Keywords?\n\nSecondary keywords are keywords that are closely related to the target keyword (also known as the primary keyword) a page is aiming to rank for. To help search engines better understand what a page is about.\n\nSecondary keywords are often synonyms or long-tail versions of the primary keyword. \n\nFor example, a page targeting the keyword “improve seo” might include the following secondary keywords:\n\n“how to improve seo”\n“ways to improve seo”\n“best practices to improve seo”\nWhy Are Secondary Keywords Important for SEO?\n\nSecondary keywords help your content rank higher for more relevant search queries. Without the need to create additional pages. \n\nAnd that can drive more organic traffic to your site, increase conversions, and boost revenue for your business.\n\nThis has to do with semantic search. Semantic search is how Google and other search engines translate what users type in the search box into a query they can understand and match.\n\nFor instance, someone looking for vegan recipes might use any of the following search queries:\n\n“vegan meal ideas”\n“vegan recipes i can make for my family on a Thursday night” \n\nBehind the scenes, the search engine takes the words users type into the box and figures out which pages contain relevant content.\n\nThey interpret the language and search intent (the reason behind the query). Then, translate it into a more common topic or phrase. \n\nIn this case, something like “vegan recipes.”\n\nThat’s why Google will return similar search results for any of these queries. Because it understands that the different searchers share the same intent.\n\nSo, including secondary keywords or variations can improve your rankings for other versions of a search query.\n\nWhat if you target the primary keyword and ignore secondary keywords?\n\nYou could rank well for “vegan recipes.” But miss out on traffic from people searching for “easy vegan recipes” and other variations. \n\nThat means you’re limiting your overall potential traffic to that page.\n\nPro tip\n\nUse our AI-powered Keyword Strategy Builder to create a comprehensive keyword strategy in seconds. Including recommended pillar pages and subpages.\n\nHow to Find Secondary Keywords\n\nLet’s go over two ways to find secondary keywords to use in your content:\n\nCheck Top-Ranking Pages\n\nStart by analyzing the top-ranking pages for your target keyword. And check which secondary keywords they rank for.\n\nHere’s how to do it using our Organic Research tool:\n\nPaste the URL of a competitor’s page you’d like to analyze. Then, click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will generate a report. \n\nNavigate to the “Positions” tab.\n\nScroll to the “Organic Search Positions” section. \n\nHere, you’ll see all the keywords the page ranks for. Along with the search volume and difficulty score for each.\n\nUse the drop-down filters at the top to help narrow your results: \n\nSearch volume: Average number of times users search for a specific keyword over a 12-month period. You might set a minimum threshold, for example. \nDifficulty: How hard it’ll be for you to rank highly for a given keyword. You might want to filter for terms that are easier to rank for, especially if your site is new.\nSearch intent: The purpose behind a user’s search. For example, you might want to filter out transactional terms if the term you’re focused on is informational.\n\nSelect specific keywords by clicking the checkboxes next to them and add them to a keyword list by clicking “+ Add to list.”\n\nOr export the keywords as a CSV or Excel file by clicking “Export.”\n\nAnalyze Secondary Keywords\n\nwith the Organic Research Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nExplore New Keyword Ideas\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool also generates keyword ideas based on your primary keyword. \n\nHere’s how:\n\nEnter your primary keyword and domain. Then, click “Search.”\n\nThe tool will generate many keyword ideas based on your primary keyword.\n\nAnd consider filtering the results based on search volume, Personal Keyword Difficulty (how likely your specific domain is to rank for that keyword), search intent, etc.\n\nFrom here, select the keywords you’d like to use. Add them to a keyword list in Semrush by clicking “+ Add to list.”\n\nOr export them to a CSV or XLSX file by clicking the export icon.\n\nIdentify Secondary Keywords\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nHow to Incorporate Secondary Keywords into Your Content\n\nOnce you’ve discovered secondary keywords through keyword research, you’ll want to add them to your new or existing content.\n\nHow?\n\nIncorporate each of the secondary keywords at least once within your text.\n\nKeep in mind that secondary keywords are usually close variations or synonyms of your target keyword. It should be pretty straightforward to edit a few instances of your primary keyword to be a secondary keyword instead. \n\nFor example:\n\n“Check out these great vegan recipes” becomes “Check out these great vegan meal ideas.”\n\nYou can also add the secondary keywords in the following spots:\n\nSubheadings\nImage alt text (HTML that briefly describes an image)\nMeta descriptions (HTML that provides a short page summary)\n\nAnd keep the reader in mind at all times. Which you can do with the below tips:\n\nFocus on search intent: Remember that this search is likely part of a larger journey for the user. Consider the query and the topic of the keyword you’re targeting. But also consider topics that will be valuable as users explore further.\nDon’t over-optimize: Keyword stuffing means overusing keywords to try to improve SEO. It’s a bad practice that applies to both primary and secondary keywords. So, don’t cram secondary keywords into your article—keyword density isn’t a ranking factor anyway.\nUse keywords naturally: Secondary keywords should always enhance the reader’s understanding. If you find yourself forcing the terms into a sentence or disrupting the content’s flow and clarity, try adding them elsewhere. \nConsider context: Use secondary keywords where it makes sense. For instance, you may not want to use a synonym when introducing the definition of your target term. But you could explain that the term in question is sometimes referred to in other ways.\nRemember your primary keyword: Secondary keywords are valuable, but stick to your primary keyword in critical spots. Like the title tag, headings, and regular occurrences throughout the body content.\n\nUse a tool like the SEO Writing Assistant to quickly optimize your content.\n\nClick “Content Marketing” > “SEO Writing Assistant” from the navigation. Then, click “Analyze new text.”\n\nPaste your list of primary and secondary keywords into the “Keywords” text box on the right. Then, click “Get recommendations.”\n\nThe SEO Writing Assistant will score any content you create based on readability, SEO, originality, and tone of voice. \n\nIn the right-hand sidebar, you’ll get specific suggestions for improving and optimizing your content. Based on the keywords you’re targeting. \n\nYou can also compose content in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Then, paste your draft into the SEO Writing Assistant when done. \n\nAlternatively, install the SWA add-on to get the same recommendations while writing in Google Docs.\n\nNext, we’ll note some important differences between keyword terms.\n\nOptimize Your Content\n\nwith the SEO Writing Assistant\n\nSign up Now →\nHow Secondary Keywords Differ from Other Types of Keywords\nSecondary Keywords vs. LSI Keywords or Related Keywords\n\nRelated keywords (so-called latent semantic indexing keywords) are not the same as secondary keywords. \n\nWhile “latent semantic indexing keywords” is a misnomer, it refers to the concept of related keywords. \n\nRelated keywords (or related terms) are words and phrases associated with your primary keyword or topic. But they’re not necessarily close variations or synonyms. \n\nFor instance, “tofu” is related to “vegan recipes.” \n\nA lot of content discussing vegan recipes references the use of tofu. \n\nSo, it’s definitely a good SEO practice to use related keywords in your content. \n\nIt helps signal article quality and topical depth. Search engines like Google (and users) probably expect most comprehensive articles about vegan recipes to mention the word “tofu” at some point.\n\nBut be aware that using the word “tofu” in your vegan recipe article likely won’t help you rank for “tofu.” Because the intent is very different.\n\nTo rank for related keywords, you’ll need to create a unique page or piece of content targeting that term (and its secondary keywords).\n\nFurther reading: Semantic Keywords: What They Are and How to Find Them\n\nSecondary Keywords vs. Long-Tail Keywords\n\nThese are also not the same thing. \n\nLong-tail keywords are more specific keywords (often with lower search volumes). In contrast to short-tail keywords (also called head terms) that generally denote broad topics with high search volumes.\n\nBecause long-tail keywords are more specific, users typing in these search terms may be more likely to take action. Like completing a form or making a purchase.\n\nWhether a term is a long-tail keyword or a short-tail keyword has no effect on whether it’s primary or secondary. These are just separate ways of categorizing and using keywords in your SEO strategy. \n\nLet’s explain this better with an example. \n\nA keyword like “homemade coffee filters” could be considered long-tail. It’s more specific than the short-tail keyword “coffee filters.” Right?\n\nBut you could still use “homemade coffee filters” as your primary keyword. Identifying it as long-tail doesn’t mean it can’t also be a primary keyword. These categories are neither mutually exclusive nor mutually inclusive.\n\nThe secondary keywords in this case would be even more specific terms. Like “homemade filters for percolator coffee pots.” \n\nUse Secondary Keywords to Boost Your Organic Traffic\n\nUsing secondary keywords throughout your content can help your pages rank for multiple keywords. And allow you to drive more organic traffic to your website.\n\nAnd they’re easy to find.\n\nUse Semrush’s Organic Research and Keyword Magic Tool to uncover secondary keywords you can add to your content today.\n\nElevate Your Keyword Strategy\n\nwith a Semrush Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →",
