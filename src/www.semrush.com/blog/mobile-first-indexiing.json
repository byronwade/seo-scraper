  "content": "What Is Mobile-First Indexing?\n\nMobile-first indexing means Google’s web crawler prioritizes indexing the mobile version of a website’s content over its desktop counterpart. Which informs rankings. \n\nWith Google’s original desktop-first indexing, their system would crawl pages from your site with the desktop and mobile user agent (crawlers). \n\nThen, it would get page information from the desktop page’s content.\n\nAnd show it in search results if the search engine thought the information was relevant to the user’s query. \n\nBut with mobile-first indexing, the indexing system will look at the mobile page instead of the desktop page for information. \n\nWhat Does Mobile-First Indexing Mean for SEO?\n\nMobile-first indexing has a significant impact on SEO. It affects how Google crawls, indexes, and (hopefully) ranks your site. \n\nWhich means:\n\nIf your site isn’t optimized for a stellar mobile user experience, it could negatively affect how it performs in search results. Or even prevent it from appearing in results.\n\nTo check your site’s mobile-friendliness, run a quick audit. \n\nSign up for a free Semrush account and open Site Audit—it’ll crawl your site with a mobile bot, just like Google. \n\nIn the settings, double-check that the crawler is set to “SiteAuditBot-Mobile.” \n\nAnd, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nYou’ll see a dashboard showing your site’s SEO health.\n\nLike this:\n\nHead to the “Issues” tab, and you’ll see the “Errors,” “Warnings,” and “Notices” holding your site back. And the number of affected pages. \n\nFind and Fix Mobile Indexing Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nMobile-First Indexing Best Practices\n\nFollow these best practices to make sure your site is optimized for Google’s mobile-first indexing:\n\nMake Your Site Mobile-Friendly and Responsive\n\nA responsive web design automatically adapts to multiple screen sizes, orientations, and devices. \n\nIt rearranges elements, adjusts font sizes, and hides unnecessary content. Making your site look great and work well on any device. \n\nThat’s key for user experience. And mobile-friendliness. \n\nHere’s what responsive design looks like on a real page:\n\nSo, instead of having multiple URLs (one for mobile and one for desktop), pick a theme for your site that’s responsive. \n\nAs you browse themes for your site, check if it’s responsive by seeing the demo page. Most website builders have this option.\n\nAlternatively, you could try shrinking your browser window. To see if everything resizes appropriately. \n\nYou can also use your phone or tablet to visit the page. Can you explore the site easily? \n\nNote: If the theme you’re currently using isn’t mobile-friendly, you might need to find a new mobile-friendly theme for your site. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe Complete Guide to Mobile SEO—8 Tips & Best Practices\nEnsure Your Website Is Crawlable\n\nIf you want Google to rank your site’s content, you need to make sure your website is crawlable.\n\nGoogle needs to be able to find your pages, run your code, and assess your content. Especially on mobile. \n\nHere are a few best practices to make sure your site is crawlable and indexable:\n\nUse structured data (a type of code that helps search engines understand your content)\nAvoid blocking any resources like CSS, JavaScript, or images\nRegularly audit your site for issues\n\nTo quickly test your site’s crawlability, run it through Site Audit. \n\nTip: Make sure the user agent is set to “SiteAuditBot-Mobile” in the settings.\n\nHead to the “Issues” tab. And in the “Category” drop-down menu, select “Crawlability.”\n\nThese are all of the errors, warnings, and notices affecting your site’s crawlability. \n\nThen, check for indexability issues. \n\nIn the “Category” drop-down, select “Indexability.” \n\nFix as many crawlability and indexability issues as you can. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nCrawlability & Indexability: What They Are & How They Affect SEO\nWhat Is Technical SEO? Basics and 10 Best Practices\nOptimize Images and Other Media for Mobile & Desktop\n\nImages are a fundamental part of most websites.\n\nAnd images can take up a ton of bandwidth—especially on mobile devices.\n\nThat's why it's essential to optimize all images and other media for all devices. Especially now that Google is fully mobile-first indexing. \n\nSo, follow image SEO best practices. \n\nHere are a few specific guidelines to ensure images are optimized for mobile:\n\nUse high-quality images, but compress them to help decrease page load times\nProvide an image sitemap (a file that helps search engines discover and index your images)\nProvide a video sitemap (a file that helps search engines discover and index your videos)\nUse structured data for media\nLazy-load images (postpone loading images until they are visible on the page) to improve site speed and save bandwidth \n\nFollow these steps and you’ll be able to create a better user experience and improve performance for both mobile and desktop. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nImage SEO and Alt Tags: Image Optimization Tips\nHow to Fix Mobile Indexing Issues\nCheck for Mobile-Friendliness\n\nOne of the best ways to test your site’s mobile-friendliness is with Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool. \n\nIt analyzes webpages and gives you a score for both mobile and desktop. And suggestions on how to improve them. \n\nNote: You can also use Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test to see at a high level whether your site is mobile-friendly. But this tool offers limited insights compared to PageSpeed Insights.\n\nOpen the tool, enter a URL, and click “Analyze.”\n\nYou’ll see two tabs in the report: “Mobile” and “Desktop.” \n\nClick on the “Mobile” tab to see your site’s mobile-friendliness score and recommendations.\n\nThe report shows a “Core Web Vitals Assessment”—which measures how fast your site loads and how stable it is during loading. \n\nThe better these metrics are, the more mobile-friendly your site is.\n\nAnd below, you’ll see a list of opportunities and diagnostics that can help you improve your site’s mobile performance and user experience. \n\nFor example, you may see suggestions to properly size images, reduce unused CSS, or eliminate render-blocking resources.\n\nLike this:\n\nYou can also click on any issue to see more information and examples:\n\nThe only problem with PageSpeed Insights is it can get very technical, quickly. And the jargon can be a bit intimidating. \n\nStill, implement as many of the tool’s suggestions as you can. Then, run the tool again to see how your scores improve. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nGoogle PageSpeed Insights: What It Is & How to Boost Your Score\nAdvanced SEO Techniques & Strategies for Success\nRun a Site Audit\n\nA better solution to finding and fixing mobile indexing issues is to run a full website audit. And you can use a tool like Site Audit. \n\nNote: Sign up for a free account and you can audit up to 100 URLs. Every day. \n\nOpen the tool, enter your domain, and click “Start Audit.” \n\nThen, configure the settings. \n\nAnd in the second tab, “Crawler settings,” make sure the “User agent” is set to “SiteAuditBot-Mobile.” \n\nOnce you’re done, click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nYou’ll see a dashboard with your site’s overall health. And other thematic reports. \n\nHead to the “Issues” tab and you’ll get a list of all the issues affecting your site. \n\nLike this:\n\nTo learn more about each issue and how to address it, click on “Why and how to fix it.”\n\nYou can also use the “Category” filter drop-down to check for specific issues. \n\nFor example, you can select “Site Performance,” “Mobile SEO,” or “Indexability.” And fix these issues first. \n\nYou should strive to fix as many errors, warnings, and notices as you can. And as soon as they pop up. Because they all affect your site’s performance. \n\nStay Informed About Page Experience and Future Developments\n\nGoogle’s page experience update is a big deal. \n\nIt measures how real-world users perceive the quality of your webpages. And looks at factors like loading speed, visual stability, and interactivity (also called the Core Web Vitals). \n\nBut providing a good page experience also depends on other signals like ensuring mobile-friendliness, using secure HTTPS pages, and avoiding intrusive pop-ups or banners. \n\nThese signals have been part of Google’s ranking algorithm for a while, but they’re now more important than ever.\n\nWhich means:\n\nYour site needs to be easy to use on mobile devices. With readable text, clickable buttons, and no unplayable content.\n\nBoth page experience and mobile-first indexing focus on improving the user experience on mobile devices. \n\nEach requires you to pay attention to your site’s performance and usability on mobile devices. \n\nAnd both can affect your rankings and traffic. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nSEO Ranking: Factors, Tips, & Tools to Improve Your Positions\nStay On Top of Your Mobile Experience\n\nAuditing your site once for mobile indexing issues isn’t enough. You need to continuously track and monitor its mobile performance.\n\nSo, make sure to schedule crawls to run automatically every week when setting up Site Audit. \n\nIf you’ve already run an audit, open your project and schedule crawls by clicking on the gear icon and scrolling down to where it says “Schedule.” \n\nAnd check the box next to “Send an email every time an audit is complete.” \n\nThen, head to the “Issues” tab. And fix them as they pop up. \n\nAddress “Errors” first. Then, “Warnings” and “Notices.” \n\nA workflow like this will help ensure your site’s SEO health stays strong. And supports higher rankings and traffic. \n\nFind and Fix Mobile Indexing Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nThis post was updated in 2023.
