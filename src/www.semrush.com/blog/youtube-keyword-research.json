  "content": "What Is YouTube Keyword Research?\n\nYouTube keyword research involves finding words and phrases users enter into the YouTube search bar to find videos they want to watch.\n\nThese words and phrases are known as YouTube keywords, search terms, or search queries. \n\nUsing these terms to optimize videos helps you rank higher in YouTube's search results. Which can increase brand awareness, improve your videos’ performance, and even drive traffic to your website.\n\nFor example, we used YouTube keywords to create our “SEO for Beginners” video. Then used those keywords in the video’s title, thumbnail, and description to help it appear higher in YouTube search results.\n\nConducting keyword research for YouTube helps you understand what your target viewers are looking for. So you can create YouTube videos they want to watch.\n\nAnd the better you can tailor your videos for your intended audience, the more likely it is that your video will show up in their YouTube searches. And the more likely it is that you’ll get views and subscribers for your channel.\n\nHow to Do Keyword Research for YouTube Videos\n\nYou can find keywords for YouTube videos by leveraging one or more of the following methods:\n\nUse YouTube Keyword Research Tools\nCheck Out the YouTube Analytics Research Report\nUse YouTube’s Autocomplete Feature\nAnalyze Your Competitors’ Videos\nDetermine the Search Intent of Your Keywords\nCreate a Keyword Map\nUse YouTube Keyword Research Tools\n\nYouTube keyword research tools show you what your target viewers search for on YouTube. And also give you data on which keywords are likely to yield the most views and engagement.\n\nThe Keyword Analytics for YouTube app tells you how many searches keywords get. And how competitive those keywords are. \n\nPlus, there’s a free trial. Here’s how to use it:\n\nAfter signing up, click “Get started” under the “Keywords Research” section. \n\nSearch for a keyword related to your video or niche (e.g., “headphones”).\n\nAnd select your country in the top right.\n\nThe tool will generate a table of related YouTube search terms. Along with how many searches they get in the selected time period (“Search Volume”) and how much competition there is for them (“Competitive rate”).\n\nYou can get data for the last day, week, or month.\n\nSwitch to the “Fast growing keywords” tab to research trending topics on YouTube.\n\nOr “Most viewed videos” to see hot topics. And get inspiration.\n\nConsider the data points for relevant keywords to make a preliminary list of keywords.\n\nNext, look for search terms used in traditional search engines. Because YouTube videos can appear on standard search pages through various SERP features (special results that show videos in search results).\n\nAround 40% of desktop SERPs in the U.S. featured a video carousel, video result, or featured video on May 14, 2024, according to the Semrush Sensor.\n\nFor example, here’s a video carousel:\n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool to find these terms. To get even more viewers and subscribers.\n\nTo start, open the tool. Enter your seed keyword, choose your location, and click \"Search.\"\n\nNext, click “Advanced filters” > “SERP Features.” \n\nAnd select the checkboxes next to “Video,” “Featured video,” and “Video carousel.” Then click “Apply.”\n\nYou’ll see tons of keyword ideas that trigger one or more of the video SERP features.\n\nIf you can find keywords around your topic that serve up video SERP features, you can include them in your relevant video content to drive traffic from Google to your YouTube videos.\n\nPro tip\n\nStart with long-tail, low-competition keywords—even if they have lower search volumes—when starting out. They’re relatively easier to rank for. \n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nCheck Out the YouTube Analytics Research Report\n\nThe Research tab in YouTube Analytics shows you popular search terms among your viewers.\n\nTo use the tool, sign in to YouTube Studio and go to “Analytics” > “Research.”\n\nThen, click the “Your viewers’ searches” tab.\n\nEnter a search term to see related keywords your viewers used in the last 28 days.\n\nThe “Search volume on YouTube” will only be listed as “High,” “Medium,” or “Low.” (Use a tool like Keyword Analytics for YouTube for more specific estimates.)\n\nLook out for YouTube search terms marked with the “Content Gap” tag. This means the user struggled to find a video that satisfied their needs.\n\nFilling these content gaps could be a great way to get more views and subscribers.\n\nFor broader insights, use the “Searches across YouTube” tab instead.\n\nAnd click the bookmark icon to add any keyword to your “Saved” tab.\n\nUse YouTube’s Autocomplete Feature\n\nYouTube’s autocomplete function serves popular searches related to the query you’re typing. And is a straightforward method for finding viable YouTube keywords for your videos. \n\nEnter a topic related to your channel or a topic you wish to make videos about in the YouTube search bar.\n\nYouTube’s autocomplete function will then serve up multiple variations of your keyword.\n\nJot down the relevant YouTube search terms that show up in autocomplete results. And make videos that target those keywords.\n\nRinse and repeat with other topics and ideas. Before long, you’ll have dozens of great video ideas for your channel.\n\nAnalyze Your Competitors’ Videos\n\nRegardless of your niche, you’re bound to have competitors who can serve as great inspiration for your YouTube videos. \n\nPull up some of your competitors’ videos and take note of the following:\n\nWhich keywords they use in their video titles and descriptions\nWhether they use any keyword variations\nHow they use keyword variations\n\nWhile you should never copy your competitors’ content, analyzing that content can show you what it’ll take to get more views on your videos.\n\nYou can take this analysis further by looking into which keywords your competitors leverage as tags.\n\nTags typically have minimal impact on search results. But many YouTubers still use them to help their videos rank.\n\nTo find the keywords your competitors are using as tags, pull up a competitor video. Then, right-click next to, but not in, the YouTube search bar. \n\nAnd select “View page source.” \n\nThe HTML source code will open in a new window.\n\nType “Ctrl + F” (on a Windows computer) or “Command + F” (on a Mac) and type <meta name=“keywords” into the search bar. \n\nThen, look through the highlighted instances to find the tag. If it’s there, the video’s keywords will be listed to the right. \n\nYou can also use a Chrome extension like Tags for YouTube to view a video’s tags more easily.\n\nDetermine the Search Intent of Your Keywords\n\nYouTube is a giant search engine. And like other search engines (Google, Bing, and Yahoo), YouTube wants to ensure it serves up content users want to see when searching for something.\n\nWhich is where search intent comes in.\n\nSearch intent refers to what a user wants to see when they search for a keyword. And for a video to rank highly in YouTube’s search results, it has to get the search intent right.\n\nThe best way to determine the search intent for your keywords is to enter each term into the YouTube search bar. To see what’s trending.\n\nThe intent can be very clear for some YouTube search terms. For example, a user who searches “iPad Pro Review” is most likely looking for a product review video.\n\nBut the intent of a YouTube keyword like “iPad Pro” can be vague. Do users want a review? Or do they want an introduction to features or a tutorial?\n\nFor vague YouTube keywords, simply type the keyword into YouTube. And take note of the top-ranking videos’ titles, descriptions, content, and thumbnails to figure out what kind of content the searcher is looking for.\n\nFor the keyword “iPad Pro,” searchers appear to be looking for any type of video that can give them a good overview of the product.\n\nNow that you have the search intent, you can make more informed decisions about the video you’re creating.\n\nA user’s search intent can also explain where they are in the marketing funnel. And each keyword can be matched to a corresponding part of the funnel. \n\nThe four types of keywords and their corresponding marketing funnel stages are:\n\nAwareness: Search intent is to learn about a product (e.g., “what are noise canceling headphones”)\nInterest: Search intent has a specific goal (e.g., “benefits of noise canceling headphones”)\nDesire: Search intent is knowledge about a possible purchase (e.g., “top noise canceling headphones”)\nAction: Search intent is to make a purchase (e.g., “purchase sony wh 1000xm4 noise canceling headphones”)\n\nTo build your influence and increase your conversions, you should create content for users at each stage.\n\nCreate a Keyword Map\n\nUse your YouTube keyword research to create a keyword map. Keyword mapping involves pairing specific keywords with content—YouTube videos in this case.\n\nThe process requires making a chart or spreadsheet of your top keywords and the specific videos they’ll work best with. \n\nYour YouTube keyword map can include elements like:\n\nA list of important keywords for your channel (acoustic guitar music, software development, or whatever your channel is about)\nMonthly keyword search volumes\nThe search intent or each of your keywords\nYour YouTube video URLs that target each keyword (or videos you’re planning to make)\nEach video’s current search ranking for its corresponding keyword\nThe amount of competition each keyword has\n\nThere are two key reasons to create and maintain a keyword map: \n\nIt helps you track which keywords you have and haven’t created content for. You don’t want to duplicate your efforts.\nIt acts as a content roadmap of keywords you’d like to create videos for in the future. If you don’t have a video for a specific top keyword, you know what your next video should be about. \n\nYou can optimize videos for multiple keywords. But you shouldn’t make multiple videos optimized for the same keyword.\n\nWhy? Because they’ll compete with one another in YouTube search results.\n\nLet’s say you have two videos optimized for the keyword “target ad.” It’s unlikely that both will rank. And if they do, users are more likely to click just one.\n\nThis means those videos could take clicks and views away from each other.\n\nHow to Use Your YouTube Keyword Research\n\nOnce you know how to find keywords for YouTube videos, you need to create your content. And optimize it for search.\n\nVideo SEO helps ensure that your videos actually get traffic, views, and subscribers.\n\nLet’s go over a few ways to make your keywords work for you:\n\nUse Keywords in Video Elements\n\nAdding the terms you discovered during your YouTube keyword research to different elements of your YouTube videos ensures your content is discoverable and relevant.\n\nHere’s where to include them:\n\nTitles\n\nThe video title is one of the first things potential viewers see in YouTube search results. And it should include your main keyword to clearly communicate what hte content is about.\n\nHere’s an example of some good YouTube video titles:\n\nFollow these tips to create effective titles:\n\nPlace your target keyword near the beginning of the title\nKeep titles to 60 characters or fewer\nUse attention-grabbing words like \"best,\" \"top,\" \"review,\" etc.\nInclude numbers (like \"5 tips\") to make your title more specific\nAvoid clickbait or misleading titles\nDescriptions\n\nWell-written descriptions help YouTube understand what your content is about and can improve your rankings.\n\nPlus, YouTube displays the beginning of your description in search results. Which helps viewers decide whether to watch your video.\n\nBut don’t just stop at the first sentence or so. A robust description that clearly explains what your video is about and includes any needed context provides a better user experience. \n\nHere’s a great example:\n\nFollow these tips to write effective YouTube video descriptions:\n\nPlace your main keyword in the first one to two sentences\nInclude your keyword two to three times when you can do so naturally\nUse related keywords where relevant\nWrite at least 200 words to give YouTube context\nAdd links to related videos, playlists, or your website\nInclude a clear call to action (CTA) to encourage viewers to like, comment, or subscribe\nHashtags\n\nInserting hashtags in your video description makes your video more visible in YouTube searches for those specific tags.\n\nWhile hashtags don’t directly impact rankings, adding popular and relevant ones to your videos can boost their discoverability among users who follow or search for specific hashtags.\n\nSo, include hashtags at the end of your description. Like this:\n\nThey’ll show up like this when your video is published:\n\nFollow these tips to optimize your hashtags:\n\nAdd a primary keyword as your hashtag\nUse only two to three hashtags\nMake sure they’re relevant to your video topic\nUse a mix of general and specific hashtags\nTags\n\nTags help YouTube's algorithm understand the content and context of your video. Which assists in associating it with similar videos on the platform and categorizing your videos more accurately.\n\nGoogle says that tags play a minimal role in video ranking and discovery. But it’s still a good idea to add them just in case they end up being helpful for some users.\n\nTo add tags to new YouTube videos:\n\nSign in to your YouTube Studio account\nClick “Create” > “Upload Video”\nChoose your video file\nDuring the upload process, click “More Options” and add your tags\n\nFor videos already on your channel:\n\nSign in to your YouTube Studio account\nClick “Content” in the menu to the left\nChoose which video you want to add tags to\nType in your tags in the “Tags” field\n\nFollow these tips to optimize your video tags:\n\nInclude your primary keyword and close variations\nUse a mix of general and specific tags\nInclude synonyms for your keyword\nAdd video-specific tags like \"how-to,\" \"tutorial,\" and \"review\"\nChapters\n\nVideo chapters break your video up into sections with their own titles to allow users to quickly navigate to what they want to see. And allow you to optimize your video with more keywords.\n\nVideo chapters are created as part of the description.\n\nTo add video chapters, list at least three timestamps in ascending order. And give each section a name. (Use your YouTube keyword research to help you.)\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nAnd here’s what that looks like in your YouTube video description once the video is live:\n\nChapters can even appear in Google SERPs, potentially increasing traffic to the video:\n\nFollow these tips to optimize your chapters:\n\nUse keyword-rich titles for each chapter\nKeep chapter titles concise\nMake the first chapter \"0:00\" and include an intro title\nAim for at least three chapters, spaced one to two minutes apart\nOptimize Videos to Rank on Google\n\nYou can drive even more traffic to your videos if they rank on both YouTube and Google.\n\nOnce again, include your keywords in your video title, description, and tags. To help Google understand the content and context of your video.\n\nHere are a few more things you can do to improve the chances of your videos appearing on Google SERPs:\n\nEmbed your video on your website or blog to provide additional context and signals to Google\nEncourage viewers to like, comment, and share your videos to increase engagement signals\nPromote your video on social media and other relevant platforms to drive engagement signals\nOptimize your video thumbnail with a clear, high-quality image that represents your video content\nAdd Keywords to Your Playlist Titles and Descriptions\n\nIncluding relevant keywords in your playlist titles can help your playlists rank in YouTube search results. Offering an additional way for users to discover your content.\n\nWhen creating a playlist, choose a title that accurately represents the theme of the videos and includes your main keywords. And place the most important keywords toward the beginning of the title.\n\nIn the playlist description, include more specific keywords and summarize what viewers will gain from watching the playlist. \n\nAn optimized description clarifies the playlist's content and can help it appear for various search queries.\n\nWith users discovering them through searches and recommendations, playlists can lead to more impressions and clicks.\n\nPlaylists also encourage viewers to watch more of your content in a single sitting. Increasing their overall watch time on your channel. \n\nLonger watch times indicate to YouTube that your content is valuable and engaging. Which can indirectly improve your channel's search visibility and bring in more views.\n\nOptimize Your Channel with Keywords\n\nAdding relevant keywords to your YouTube channel description helps YouTube understand your channel's overall theme and categorize it accurately. \n\nThis can boost your channel's visibility in searches related to your content. But it also has a ripple effect on the performance of your individual videos.\n\nWhen you optimize your channel with keywords, YouTube better understands the context of your videos. \n\nThis makes your videos more likely to appear in related search results and recommendations, driving more views and engagement.\n\nTo add channel keywords, go to your YouTube Studio settings, click \"Channel,\" and add keywords under \"Basic info.\" \n\nChoose five to 10 keywords that cover your channel's main topics. For example, a cooking channel might include \"healthy recipes,\" \"easy meals,\" \"cooking tips,\" and \"food inspiration.\"\n\nFurther reading: YouTube Channel Keywords: What They Are + 7 Best Practices\n\nYouTube Keyword Research FAQs\n\nWe’ve compiled the most frequently asked questions about YouTube keyword research and their answers below.\n\nWhat Are the Best Keywords for YouTube?\n\nThe best keywords vary, depending on the topic of each video. For high-level topics, you’d likely want high-volume keywords that attract an audience. \n\nIf you’re looking to create niche videos, your keywords should be more targeted to those who want to watch your videos.\n\nFor example, someone looking up “oil change” on YouTube might want to know why they should get an oil change. But someone searching for “how to do an oil change,” indicates they want to perform the action themselves.\n\nHow Many Keywords Should You Use for YouTube Videos?\n\nThere's no specific number of keywords to use. But aim to include your main keyword once in your video title and two to three times in your description. You can also add a few keywords as hashtags. \n\nUltimately, focus on choosing the most relevant keywords for your content and including them naturally. \n\nAvoid keyword stuffing, which can hurt your videos’ rankings.\n\nHow Do You Track Your YouTube Rankings?\n\nOnce you have your keywords mapped and your content created, use the Rank Tracker for YouTube app to monitor how your content is performing in YouTube searches. \n\nIt tracks your videos’ rankings on YouTube for the keywords you choose.\n\nMonitor Your YouTube Rankings\n\nwith Rank Tracker for YouTube\n\nTry for Free →",
