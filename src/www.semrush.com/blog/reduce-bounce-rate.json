  "content": "What Is Bounce Rate?\n\nBounce rate measures the percentage of sessions where users don’t engage meaningfully with your site, according to Google Analytics 4 (GA4). And an unengaged session is counted when:\n\nA user views only one page\nThe session lasts less than 10 seconds\nNo conversion events are triggered\n\nBounce rate isn’t a confirmed Google ranking factor. But a high rate often signals users aren’t getting what they want or that there are other issues with your site. \n\nWorking to address these problems can positively affect your performance. \n\nA good bounce rate varies by industry. But most websites should aim for 40%-60%. Lower is generally better.\n\n12 Tips to Reduce Your Bounce Rate\n1. Satisfy User Intent\n\nYour SEO-focused pages need to align with what users are looking for. Otherwise, those visitors will leave and contribute to a higher bounce rate.\n\nFor example, the search \"how to fix a leaky faucet\" reveals people are looking for a step-by-step guide. Which you can tell by looking at the results:\n\nSo, if your page focuses on selling plumbing services and doesn’t include any DIY information, it doesn’t satisfy the user's intent.\n\nTo match your content with what users want from search results, identify the intent behind your target keywords using Keyword Overview. \n\nOpen the tool, enter your keyword, select your country, and click “Search.”\n\nCheck the “Intent” box in the default “Overview” report. Here, you’ll see one or more of the four main search intent categories:\n\nInformational: Users want to learn something\nNavigational: Users are looking for a specific page or site\nCommercial: Users want to do research before buying\nTransactional: Users want to make a purchase or complete a similar action\n\nNext, scroll down to the \"SERP Analysis\" table in Keyword Overview. Click on the external link icons to visit the top-ranking pages. And study them to understand what users expect.\n\nFor our \"how to fix a leaky faucet\" example, the top-ranking pages cover multiple faucet types and provide step-by-step instructions. Some even feature video tutorials, like this page from The Home Depot:\n\nEvaluate whether your page has these elements. If not, incorporating them will help you satisfy user intent. Which can improve engagement and reduce bounce rates.\n\nFurther reading: What Is Keyword Intent & How to Align Keywords with User Needs\n\nDiscover User Intent\n\nwith the Keyword Overview Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n2. Speed Up Your Website\n\nA slow-loading site prevents users from being able to interact with your content when they want to—which leads to them quickly leaving. This is why you should aim to keep your site as fast as possible.\n\nTo check an individual page’s speed on your site, use Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool. \n\nIt gives you a performance score out of 100. A score of 90 or higher is considered very good.\n\nTo check the speed across your entire website, use Semrush’s Site Audit tool. \n\nOpen the tool, enter your domain, and click \"Start Audit.\"\n\nNext, follow our guide on configuring Site Audit.\n\nOnce the audit is done, you’ll see an “Overview” report. \n\nClick “View details” under “Site Performance.”\n\nYou’ll see the average page load speed. \n\nYou can also view errors and warnings that are slowing down your site. Click “Why and how to fix it” next to any issue to learn more about it and how to address it.\n\nGo through each of the issues and apply the suggested fixes. (You may need to work with a developer for some.)\n\nBut in general, here are some steps you can take to speed up your site:\n\nOptimize images by compressing them with a tool like TinyPNG\nEnable browser caching to allow returning visitors to load your pages faster\nUse a content delivery network (CDN) to deliver content from servers closer to users' locations\nRemove unnecessary code from your pages\n\nCheck Your Website’s Speed\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →\n3. Improve the User Experience\n\nProviding good user experience (UX) reduces your bounce rate. Because people are more likely to stay and engage when your site is easy to navigate and interact with. \n\nThis is especially important when considering how to reduce bounce rate on an ecommerce website, where user-friendly navigation can significantly impact sales.\n\nStart by limiting your main menu items to between five and seven options so navigation is simpler. And group related pages under clear, descriptive categories. \n\nFor example, an ecommerce site might use categories like \"Women,\" \"Men,\" and \"Kids\" instead of product types. Like H&M does:\n\nAlso, aim for a clean, consistent layout across all pages. Using brand-aligned colors and easily readable fonts. \n\nAnd structure your content with headings, subheadings, and enough white space to enhance readability. This allows users to quickly scan and find the information they need. \n\nYou should also make your site accessible to all users—including those with disabilities—by incorporating: \n\nAlt text for images\nProper color contrast\nKeyboard navigation \n\nFinally, ensure your site is optimized for all device types. Meaning text should be readable and buttons should be easy to tap or click on smaller screens. \n\nFocusing on these UX elements will help you create a more engaging site that encourages visitors to stay longer and explore more pages. \n\nCheck out our article on UX and SEO to learn more. \n\n4. Create Helpful, Engaging Content\n\nIf you’re looking for ideas specifically on how to reduce your blog’s bounce rate, focusing on creating helpful content that answers your visitors' questions is a great option. Because users are more likely to stay on your site when you do this.\n\nStart by understanding who your target audience is and what information they might be looking for. \n\nUse One2Target to do this.\n\nOpen the tool, enter up to five competitors’ domains, and click “Analyze.”\n\nYou'll see four reports:\n\nDemographics: Shows audience age, gender, and location breakdowns\nSocioeconomics: Shows household sizes, income levels, employment statuses, and education levels\nBehaviors: Shows audience interests, device preferences, and social media use\nAudience Overlap: Shows shared audiences between your competitors\n\nUse these insights to tailor your content's tone, perspective, and cultural references to resonate with your audience.\n\nFor example, if your audience is young professionals interested in fitness, you might use more dynamic language. And reference popular workout trends or health apps they're likely familiar with.\n\nWhen you’re ready to write, follow these tips for creating helpful content:\n\nProvide actionable advice. Offer clear and practical solutions to readers' problems.\nShow expertise. Show your depth of knowledge by providing unique insights or insider information.\nUse credible sources. Back up your claims with data from reputable sources to build trust with your readers.\nIllustrate with examples. Use real-life examples or case studies to make your content more relatable and easier to understand.\nTailor content to your audience. Adjust your writing style and complexity to match your audience's reading level. Use Semrush's SEO Writing Assistant to measure your content’s readability.\n5. Use Clear Calls to Action\n\nUsing clear calls to action (CTAs) on your conversion-oriented pages guides your visitors on what to do next—sign up for a newsletter, make a purchase, etc. Which can reduce bounce rates.\n\nHere’s an example of a strong CTA from Wise:\n\nTo create effective CTAs:\n\nMake them stand out. Use contrasting colors and plenty of white space around your CTAs to draw attention to them.\nUse action-oriented text. Start with strong verbs like \"Download,\" \"Subscribe,\" or \"Buy\" to clearly indicate the action you want users to take.\nKeep it concise. Aim for two to five words. \"Start Your Free Trial\" is more effective than \"Click Here to Begin Your Free 30-Day Trial Now.”\nPlace CTAs strategically. Position your main CTA above the fold (meaning in the section users see without scrolling), where it's immediately visible. For longer pages, repeat CTAs at logical intervals.\n\nFurther reading: 30 Attention-Grabbing Call to Action Examples\n\n6. Make Important Content Immediately Visible\n\nDisplaying key information above the fold could reduce your bounce rate. Because when users immediately see relevant content, they're more likely to stay on your site.\n\nHere's an example from ClickUp: \n\nAs you can see, the company clearly explains what it offers, who the solution is for, and the main benefits. \n\nTo effectively highlight your most important message above the first fold, you should:\n\nThink about what your visitors want. What are they looking for on your page? Product info? Contact details? Your latest blog post?\nPut the core message first. Make sure the most important information is right at the top, where visitors can't miss it.\nUse visual hierarchy. Design your page layout to draw attention to the most important elements first. Try larger fonts, contrasting colors, and strategic placement.\nInclude engaging elements. Use elements like catchy headlines, high-quality pictures, and/or videos to grab attention quickly.\n7. Focus on Readability\n\nContent that’s written and formatted with readability in mind ensures visitors can easily skim and digest it. Which reduces the chances of them getting frustrated and leaving.\n\nConsider these two versions of the same content:\n\nThe second version is easier to read.\n\nHere’s how to ensure your content is reader-friendly:\n\nUse clear language. Avoid jargon that might confuse readers. And convey concepts as clearly as possible. \nUse headings and subheadings. Break your content into smaller sections with clear headings and subheadings. This structure helps readers skim and quickly find the information they need.\nStick to short paragraphs. Keep paragraphs short—ideally two to three sentences each.\nInclude bullet points and lists. Turn data points or steps into bullet points or numbered lists so the content can be more quickly understood.\nUse ample white space. Use margins and spacing between lines and paragraphs to make it easier on the eyes.\nBe selective about your font and color scheme. Use a readable font size and style. And maintain a consistent color scheme that doesn’t distract readers.\n8. Add Relevant Images and Videos\n\nIncluding relevant images and videos can enrich your content and make it more engaging. Which reduces the likelihood of visitors bouncing from your site. \n\nTo effectively use visual elements in your content:\n\nChoose high-quality media. Use high-resolution images and videos that are directly related to the content. Avoid generic stock photos that don’t add real value.\nAdd descriptive alt text. Provide alt text for all images to improve accessibility and potentially boost SEO.\nClarify complex ideas. Use diagrams or infographics to explain difficult concepts visually.\nShow processes. Use step-by-step images or videos to show how to do something.\nCreate visual consistency. Use a similar style or color scheme for images across your site to reinforce your brand.\nUse captions when needed. Add explanatory captions for complex images or when extra context is helpful. Not all images need captions.\n\nJust make sure to balance visual elements with text. Because too many images can overwhelm users.\n\n9. Link to Related Pages on Your Site\n\nLinking to other relevant pages on your site (called internal linking) is a great way to provide readers with related content they may be interested in. Which could encourage them to stay and interact with your website. \n\nAs an added bonus, it also boosts your SEO by helping search engines discover your pages.\n\nHere are some tips for incorporating internal links:\n\nUse contextual links. Include links within the body of your content where they naturally fit, guiding readers to related topics.\nUse descriptive anchor text. Make sure the anchor text for your links is informative and relates to the pages they’re linking to. Avoid vague phrases like \"click here.\"\nAdd navigation and sidebar links. Use your navigation features and sidebar to help readers to get to the most important places on your website.\nTry a related articles section. List related articles at the end of blog posts and other informational content. So readers can easily find more content they’re likely interested in. Like we do on our blog:\n\nIf you need help studying your internal links and finding pages that need more, use Site Audit.\n\nFrom the “Overview” report, click “View details” under “Internal Linking.”\n\nYou can now see how internal links are distributed across your site.\n\nThere’s also a list of issues related to linking that you should assess. Addressing any of those problems could improve your site’s overall performance.\n\n10. Try A/B Testing\n\nA/B testing involves creating two versions of a page, changing just one element, and seeing which performs better. Which helps you find the most effective elements on your pages to keep visitors engaged.\n\nYou can test elements like headlines, CTA buttons, images, or content layout. \n\nRun your test for a few weeks to gather enough data. The results will give you insights you can apply to improve multiple pages on your site.\n\nFor example, you might test two different headlines on a product page. \n\nAfter running the test, you find that one headline leads to a 15% decrease in bounce rate. You can then use this information to improve headlines across your site.\n\nUse the Landing Page Builder app to easily create and test different versions of your pages.\n\nChoose from various landing page templates. And edit the page from a simple drag-and-drop interface.\n\nEasily create multiple variants of the page. And then edit specific elements in each variant that you want to A/B test.\n\nDefine the traffic split (how you divide visitors between different variants). And click “Start the test.”\n\nCheck out our guide to A/B testing landing pages for more tips. \n\n11. Show Off Social Proof\n\nSocial proof builds trust with new visitors by showing them that other people find value in what you offer. Which may prevent them from quickly leaving your site.\n\nYou can add social proof to your homepage, landing pages, product pages, and blog posts in prominent places. For example, you can feature:\n\nThe number of customers you serve\nRatings on review sites like G2 and Trustpilot\nThe number of social shares the page has gotten \nPositive things your customers have said\nNames of brands or individuals who use your software\nAwards or certifications your business has received\n\nHere’s an example from Calendly's homepage:\n\nPlace some form of social proof high up on the page—so it’s visible. And then add more as needed throughout the page to reinforce your credibility.\n\n12. Be Careful with Ads and Pop-Ups\n\nOverloading your site with ads and pop-ups can frustrate visitors and make them leave quickly. Because they distract from what users came to see or do.\n\nWhile these elements can be good for revenue or lead generation, they shouldn't ruin the user experience.\n\nTake inspiration from Investopedia—a publication that uses multiple ads on their pages:\n\nBut they carefully manage these elements to avoid overwhelming visitors. \n\nYou should aim for a similar balance. Here's how:\n\nLimit quantity. Avoid cluttering your pages with too many ads or pop-ups.\nChoose placement wisely. Position any ads where they're visible but don't interrupt the user's reading or navigation.\nConsider timing. If you must use pop-ups, set them to appear after visitors have spent some time on your site or when they’re about to leave (these are called exit-intent pop-ups).\nMake dismissal easy. Ensure visitors can close pop-ups easily.\nTest different formats. Experiment with various ad types to find what’s least intrusive to your audience.\n\nIf you notice more visitors leaving after adding new ads or pop-ups, rethink your approach.\n\nHow to Check Bounce Rate and Pick Which Tips to Use\n\nLooking into how visitors interact with your site can reveal ideas on how to reduce bounce rate on your website. There are a few tools you can use for help.\n\nFirst, you can get ideas on how to reduce bounce rate using Google Analytics 4.\n\nLog in to your GA4 account, then navigate to “Reports” > “Engagement” > “Pages and screens.”\n\nClick the pencil icon in the top right corner of the report. \n\nNext, select “Metrics.”\n\nScroll to the bottom, click the “Add metric” field, type “Bounce rate,” and select “Bounce rate” when it appears.\n\nAnd click “Apply” to save your changes.\n\nYou can now view the bounce rate for each of your pages.\n\nGo through the report to identify pages with particularly high bounce rates. So you can prioritize ones that need the most improvement.\n\nThen, consider using additional tools like Hotjar and Google Search Console to get a fuller picture of user behavior. Which can show you where users click, how far they scroll, and what queries bring them to your site.\n\nUsing all the data you’ve collected, see whether you can identify opportunities.\n\nFor example, if users are bouncing from product pages, Hotjar might reveal they're not scrolling far. This could indicate your CTAs need work.\n\nUsing insights from multiple tools will help you pinpoint the most effective ways to reduce bounce rates across your site.\n\nIf you’re having trouble coming up with anything concrete, conduct A/B testing to see what changes make a difference.\n\nTake Action to Reduce Your Bounce Rate\n\nIf your bounce rate is high, many factors could be contributing.\n\nRun a comprehensive site audit. Which will help you identify many potential problems.\n\nA great first step is to check your site's loading speed with Site Audit.\n\nTry it today.\n\nFind Issues Slowing Down Your Site\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nSign Up Now →",
