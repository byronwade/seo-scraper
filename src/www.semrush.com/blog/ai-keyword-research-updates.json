Now, Keyword Strategy Builder helps you visualize and build an entire SEO content strategy from the ground up using Topics and Pages. What was once the time-consuming task of creating a keyword strategy is now fully automated with AI. \n\nWhen you enter your seed keywords, it doesn’t just spit back a list; it creates a clear map of pillar pages and subpages, guiding you on what pages to create for your website and what keywords to use.\n\nHow It’s Better\n\nHere's how this tool is changing the game:\n\nStreamlined Website Hierarchy: Making a plan for website structure is now smoother than ever. This tool replaces traditional keyword clustering with a clear hierarchy that links pillar topics to subtopics, each aligned with the right keywords. This ensures your content plan is organized effectively for both people and search engines.\nContent Planning Made Simple: The tools help you narrow down how much content you need, what topics to cover, and how to link them together for the best SEO results. It’s like a guide to mapping your content strategy, making content planning easier.\nOrganized Topics and Pages: The tool neatly categorizes your content into Topics and Pages, each tagged with specific keywords and metrics.\nTopics: A Topic is a group of keyword clusters, organized by theme and importance, designed for your website's main Pillar pages and their Subpages.\nPages: Pages consist of a list of Pillar and Subpages, each with keywords specifically associated with them.\n\nWith the new Keyword Strategy Builder, you can craft a well-thought-out strategy that will bring clarity and direction to your SEO efforts. \n\nCreate Your Keyword Strategy in Minutes\n\nwith the Keyword Strategy Builder\n\nTry for Free →\nPersonalized Keyword Research Use Case: Promoting an Online Platform\n\nImagine you run a digital marketing agency and are tasked with promoting Wix.com as a leading platform for building online stores. \n\nYou start by entering \"how to make an online shop\" into the updated Keyword Magic Tool. Then, you enter the domain name in the AI-powered filter bar to focus the report on finding the best keyword opportunities for Wix.com. \n\nThe tool quickly provides a breakdown of related keywords, highlighting which terms Wix.com can rank for effectively, using the new Personal Keyword Difficulty (PKD).\n\nWhile keywords like “online shopping website” are moderately competitive, they are still highly relevant and obtainable for promoting Wix.com. \n\nInterestingly, it also reveals that Wix.com ranks first for \"how to create a website,\" a top-ranked keyword in this niche, reinforcing Wix.com’s authority on the topic of website creation.\n\nUsing the Keyword Overview tool, you then focus on a single keyword from these suggestions, examining potential SERP positions and the competitive landscape. This tool provides detailed insights into how the keyword fits into the broader clusters around your seed topic, enabling more strategic planning. \n\nNext, you can turn to the Keyword Strategy Builder to structure these keywords into a content plan. \n\nThe tool suggests drafting pillar pages such as \"Best Online Shopping Websites,\" then outlining several subpages and their target keywords.\n\nEach page and subpage is linked to specific keywords that can be targeted together with a single page to promote the website effectively. With each page, it’s easy to see the total volume and average difficulty of the keywords. \n\nThis data-driven strategy ensures that you focus on the most achievable keywords, positioning Wix.com for increased SEO success and traffic growth.\n\nHow Are These New Metrics Calculated?\n\nSemrush's Personal Keyword Difficulty is calculated using Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze any domain's relevance to any specific keyword. \n\nIt’s a complex process, but the basic way it works is that we’ve combined Semrush data with LLMs to develop a thematic vector map of every topic and how topics are related to each other. This allows us to measure the “distance” between any two topics. \n\nWhen determining a domain's main topics and authority, we can measure the distance between that domain and any other topic on the map. \n\nThis measurement allows us to determine Topical Authority— the closer the thematic match, the lower the PKD%, showing the keyword is a good fit for your site.\n\nThis method ensures that our keyword suggestions are finely tuned to your site’s current standing and potential in search rankings.\n\nLooking Ahead to AI-Backed Keyword Research \n\nSemrush's AI enhancements revolutionize keyword research by tailoring it to your domain's unique strengths with features like PKD and Topical Authority. \n\nThese tools are engineered to boost your SEO efficiency, helping you strategically climb search rankings.\n\nAnd the best part?\n\nThese features are included in any paid Semrush subscription. \n\nReady to elevate your SEO game? \n\nCreate Your Keyword Strategy in Minutes\n\nwith the Keyword Strategy Builder\n\nTry for Free →",
