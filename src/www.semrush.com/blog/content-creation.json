  "title": "Content Creation: What It Is & How to Do It in 2024 [Tips + Tools]",
  "content": "Content is essential for reaching your target audience and fueling your marketing engine.\n\nBut how do you get started?\n\nIn this article, we dive into various types of content and lay out a content creation process you can follow. \n\nWhat Is Content Creation?\n\nContent creation is the process of creating various forms of media that appeal to your target audience. \n\nIt involves multiple steps, from generating an initial idea to promoting a published piece. \n\nAnd the content creation process involves different experts. \n\nFor instance, content strategists often identify relevant topic ideas that align with marketing goals. And writers, video producers, and other creators turn these ideas into exciting pieces of content.\n\nHere are some of the most common roles based on our State of Content Marketing report:\n\nWhy Is Creating Content Important?\n\nContent creation is key for ensuring you have what you need to reach potential customers. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it’s a key part of content marketing—a long-term strategy that involves developing and sharing content across channels to reach and engage your target audience. \n\nWhich helps in your efforts to:\n\nGrow brand awareness\nEngage with different online communities\nRetain existing customers \nEducate potential customers\nBuild credibility\nImprove organic (unpaid) search rankings\n\nImproving organic rankings through content can be especially beneficial for reaching potential customers. \n\nYou do this through search engine optimization (SEO), which involves creating and improving your website and content to rank higher in Google’s search results. \n\nTypes of Content \n\nIt’s a good idea to produce various types of content to maximize your reach. Here are just a few:\n\nBlog Posts\n\nBlog posts are a great way to educate readers (and they often account for a lot of website content creation). Blog posts also help with brand awareness, search rankings, and customer loyalty. \n\nIn fact, the marketers and business owners surveyed in our State of Content Marketing report said both short-form and long-form articles were some of their best-performing content formats.\n\nTake a look at the results:\n\nComing up with fresh blog ideas and executing them well is important. It helps your content to stand out from the crowd. \n\nContent Creation Ideas for Blog Posts\n\nHere are some blog post concept ideas to inspire you: \n\n101 content: Answer frequent questions beginners in your industry have\n201 content: Provide more sophisticated content for seasoned professionals \nComparisons: Compare multiple solutions, products, or services\nCurations: Share the best resources on a given topic \nHow-to guides: Give step-by-step walkthroughs for important processes\nNews: Share announcements about recent company and product updates, awards, and more\n\nYour blog can contain some or all of these content formats. \n\nFor example, Semrush’s blog contains multiple categories with many types of blog posts. \n\nThere are basic, 101-style pieces. But also advanced SEO articles, in-depth guides, and more. \n\nInfographics\n\nInfographics are visual representations of data points or narratives. \n\nInfographics do a good job of conveying complex or data-heavy information in a digestible way. They also help break up walls of text. And tend to be shared on social media and referenced by other sites. \n\nYou can look for interesting data relevant to your industry and visualize them with infographics. Or find inspiration from popular infographics in other industries. \n\nContent Creation Ideas for Infographics \n\nInfographics take many shapes and forms. Here are some ideas to spark your creativity:\n\nProcess explanation: Break down a complex process related to your industry or product\nIndustry trends: Use data to illustrate current trends in your industry\nCompany timeline: Tell the story of your company and its key milestones\nFAQs: Convert your most frequently asked questions into an infographic\nCharts: Convey numerical data in bar charts, pie charts, and more\nMaps: Present location-based data and information with simple or custom maps \n\nInfographics can be impressive. For instance, look at this infographic that shows how Captura removes carbon from the environment. \n\nWhat if you don’t have the resources to produce complex infographics? Simpler infographics like the one below can also do the trick and get your point across. \n\nVideos\n\nVideos can be standalone pieces on YouTube or your website. But they can also enhance text content. \n\nAnd 45% of the marketers and business owners surveyed in our State of Content Marketing report cite video as the single most effective content format.\n\nVideos can be labeled with metadata, like tags and descriptions. But they can have limited searchability compared to text. \n\nAnd you can repurpose existing blog posts into video content. Founders and executives can also post short video clips on social media sharing their thoughts.\n\nContent Creation Ideas for Videos \n\nWhether you opt for live-action footage or computer-generated visuals, here are several video content ideas to look into:\n\nExplainers: Concisely explain a product, service, or concept\nProduct demos: Walk through a product or service, covering its features and benefits\nCase studies: Feature satisfied customers who share their experiences \nTutorials: Share step-by-step instructions on how to perform a task or learn a skill\nBehind-the-scenes: Show a glimpse into the inner workings of a business\nAnimations: Tell a story in an animated form\n\nFor example, McKinsey & Company uses video in its article on nature conservation. \n\nThe video (shown below) provides readers with additional details on the efforts their experts put into protecting ecosystems. \n\nPodcasts\n\nPodcasts create a deep connection with listeners through storytelling and discussions. They help build a loyal fan base. \n\nAnd nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population over age 12 has listened to a podcast, according to Edison Research. \n\nStarting a podcast doesn’t have to be daunting, either. \n\nIdentify topics that both you and your audience are passionate about. Then, plan your content ahead. Decide whether you will invite guests or run solo, how long should episodes be, and more.\n\nAfter you record episodes, you can publish them on podcast directories like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts. \n\nYou can also use listener feedback to improve.\n\nContent Creation Ideas for Podcasts \n\nPodcasts lend themselves well to many creative formats. Here are some ideas to explore:\n\nExpert interviews: Feature industry experts, thought leaders, and influencers \nSuccess stories: Explore how businesses related to your podcast’s theme achieved success\nQ&A sessions: Focus on answering questions submitted by your audience \nIndustry trends: Highlight trending topics and emerging technologies in your niche\nPanel discussions: Engage experts in a panel discussion on a specific topic \nReviews: Discuss books, movies, and events related to your podcast’s theme \n\nTry to release various types of podcast content to engage your audience. The popular business podcast “Acquired” is great at this.\n\nThe hosts produce interviews, company origin stories, panel discussions, and more. \n\nHere’s a snapshot of what they’ve covered:\n\nSocial Media Posts\n\nSocial media content enables brands to reach over 4.5 billion users. So they can connect with different audiences and cater to their preferences. \n\nAnd comments, likes, shares, and direct messages offer an opportunity to interact with audiences and foster a sense of community.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: \n\nEach platform has a specific type of content that performs well. \n\nFor example, TikTok is known for its fun, short videos (shown below). And high-quality imagery is popular on Instagram.\n\nThese platforms also collect user data. And brands can tap into this data to improve their content. \n\nYou can also repurpose some of your blog content for social media.\n\nFor instance, popular SEO-focused content can be turned into short explainer videos and shared across social media accounts. \n\nContent Creation Ideas for Social Media Posts \n\nTest different types of social media content to see what performs best. Here are some ideas to get you going: \n\nContent promotion: Share links to content published on your website \nBehind-the-scenes: Post photos or videos of your workspace or creative process\nProduct spotlights: Explain the benefits of your latest product or service\nUser-generated content: Reshare photos, videos, and reviews generated by your customers\nPolls and surveys: Gather opinions or insights from your audience\nSeasonal content: Comment on current festivities and holidays\nInspirational quotes: Share motivational messages and quotes paired with exciting graphics\nGiveaways: Run social media contests to reward your followers\nLive videos: Conduct live Q&A sessions, event spotlights, and more\n\nAnd social can be a good place to share a laugh.\n\nFor example, Burger King doesn’t shy away from using humor in their social media posts. \n\nBut you probably want to go beyond just posting humorous content. \n\nYou also want to be approachable and share helpful content as well. Here’s how we do that: \n\nInteractive Content\n\nInteractive content encourages users to engage with your content, which can translate to them spending more time on your site, following you on social media, and more. This can increase brand awareness and even help them move closer to making a purchase.\n\nInteractive content pieces also add instant value. Think calculators, polls, and interactive maps. \n\nAnd other sites are likely to link to useful pieces of interactive content. \n\nOne way to ideate interactive content is to think about your audience’s needs. And how you can meet those needs in a way that static content can’t. \n\nContent Creation Ideas for Interactive Content \n\nInteractive content can take numerous forms. Here are some different formats:\n\nQuizzes & surveys: Enable visitors to learn more about themselves or their customers and employees through a series of questions\nCalculators: Help users find a numerical value for a specific process or purchase\nInteractive webinars: Give attendees the opportunity to comment and ask questions in real time\nInteractive maps: Allow users to focus on different geographical areas to uncover specific information\n\nLooking for more specific examples of interactive content?\n\nReview these great examples: \n\nMadison Reed’s Hair Color Quiz\nClearbit’s Total Addressable Market Calculator\nEmpire Flippers’ Online Business Valuation Calculator\nHow to Develop a Marketing Content Creation Process\n\nCreate great content by executing on an agreed-upon content strategy. Here are some key content creation steps you and your team can follow.\n\nGenerate Content Ideas\n\nGreat content starts with developing ideas your audience will find interesting and useful. \n\nThose ideas should focus on your audience’s needs, interests, and pain points.\n\nHow can you find that information? Here are several resources you can use to learn more about your audience: \n\nAnalytics tools: Use Google Analytics, social media platforms, and other tools you have to learn about your audience’s interests and problems\nSales reps’ input: Talk to your sales reps to discover the topics customers and prospects bring up most often\nCustomer support calls: Listen to recorded calls from you support team to identify common themes across support calls that can be proactively addressed with content\nOnline communities: Look for the topics your target audience talks about on forums, social media, Slack groups, and other online venues\nCompetitive research: Examine your competitors to discover what kind of content they’re creating or find new angles on popular topics\n\nAs you research, make note of overarching content ideas that align with your audience. These topics can inform seed keywords—broad search terms you can enter into a keyword tool to find more focused and relevant keywords.\n\nLet’s go over how to do that next.\n\nResearch Topics\n\nNow, it’s time to research topics based on your ideas and seed keywords. To find specific angles that you can create content around.\n\nYou can do this using a keyword research tool like Keyword Magic Tool. \n\nLet’s say you want to find topics related to selling ebooks. \n\nOpen the tool, type in your seed keyword, select the target country, and click “Search.” \n\nYou’ll now see a list of keywords related to your topic, sorted by search volume. Like this:\n\nYou’ll probably see thousands of results. So, how do you narrow your results? \n\nYou can filter this keyword selection by including or excluding specific words. \n\nFor example, maybe you don’t sell on Amazon. Just add “amazon” to the “Exclude keywords” field.\n\nYou can also use the suggested groups and subgroups in the column to the left of the keyword list. This helps you sort keywords by subtopics. \n\nHere’s how it looks when you select “online” as a subgroup.\n\nThen, use the “Advanced filters” drop-down to find long-tail keywords. This option enables you to specify the word count, search engine results page (SERP) position, and other details of your ideal keywords. \n\nYou can repeat this for multiple groups and subgroups. Then, you can group them into keyword clusters (groups of related terms) you can create different pieces of content around.\n\nYou can also find ideas by using Keyword Gap to find out which keywords your competitors are focusing on. \n\nNavigate to the tool, enter your domain and the domains of up to four competitors, and click “Compare.” \n\nWhen you see the dashboard, scroll down and click on “Missing” in the “All keyword details for:” section.\n\nYou’ll see the list of keywords your competitors’ sites rank for but your site doesn’t. \n\nThere are probably a ton of options. So, how do you find good options? \n\nOne way to do that is to filter by your competitors’ top pages. \n\nGo to “Position,” select “Competitors,” and click “Top 10.”\n\nOnce you have a solid list of topics, you can use them to plan a content calendar that lays out when each piece of content will be published and on which channel.\n\nThen, write a brief for each upcoming topic. \n\nA brief outlines the specifics and expectations for a piece of content. It guides the process to ensure everyone understands the objective, audience, proper messaging, and other details.\n\nTip: Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder offers an automated way to create topic clusters. Click the green “Create list” button, then add your seed keywords in the next menu, and press “Create list.” You’ll be provided with various clusters to work with.\n\nProduce Great Content\n\nIt’s time to start the content creating itself. \n\nMaybe that means assigning it to a team member or freelancer. Or maybe you’re producing the work yourself.\n\nEither way, you want to focus on quality.\n\nProducing any form of great content involves making it: \n\nAudience-centric: Tailor content to your audience’s interests and pain points\nValuable: Provide value to your audience by educating them or presenting solutions\nClear and concise: Use plain language, avoid jargon, and keep the message straightforward\nEngaging: Use storytelling, visuals, and possibly interactive elements to capture your audience’s attention\nCredible: Cite credible sources, use data to back up claims, and consider interviewing experts\nUnique: Your content should offer something different than what's already out there\nActionable: Good content encourages the audience to do something, whether it’s to think differently, apply the knowledge they've gained, share the content, or make a purchase\n\nThere are other nuances to producing great content that you can explore in our content quality guide.\n\nOne example of great content is this CB Insights piece about Discord: \n\nThe article delivers value by sharing multiple examples, quotes, and data points. It’s written clearly and uses a lot of imagery to get the point across. \n\nAnd its structure is logical and easy to follow. It takes readers on a journey, starting with how Discord was launched and ending with what lies ahead. \n\nYou also need to make sure an article is easy to understand and optimized for your target keywords.\n\nIt’s easy to do this with the SEO Writing Assistant. \n\nOpen the tool and click “Analyze my text.” \n\nType or paste your content in the text field, add your target keywords, then click “Get recommendations.”\n\nYou’ll now see suggestions for improving your content related to “Readability,” “Originality,” “Tone of voice,” and “SEO.”\n\nHere’s an example of what you might see:\n\nYou don’t have to act on every recommendation. Assess to determine which ones are important to you, and then implement them. \n\nIt’s also easy to share this content with team members to edit. Either share directly in the tool or choose the option to “Move to Google Docs.”\n\nOnce your content is written and edited, it’s time to publish it and work on promotion. \n\nFurther reading: 14 Tips for Writing Awesome Website Content\n\nPromote Content\n\nContent creation and marketing go hand in hand.

Because you can use it to learn more about how competitors drive audiences to their website content. \n\nHead to the tool, enter one or more competitors’ domains, and click “Analyze.”\n\nYou’ll reach the “Overview” dashboard first. Then, click the “Traffic Journey” tab. \n\nYou’ll now see the percentage of traffic your competitors get from various channels, including referral, organic search, paid social, and more. \n\nThe “Traffic Journey Details” table at the bottom is especially useful for seeing how certain channels drive to certain pages. \n\nFor instance, if you select “Sources” and “Organic Social,” you can see which social platforms drive the most traffic to your competitors.\n\nThese insights can help you understand which channels are successful in driving traffic to your competitors.
