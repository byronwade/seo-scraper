  "title": "8 Effective Marketing Channels in 2024 (+ How to Get Started)",
  "content": "Today, you're going to learn about eight marketing channels that can get visitors to your site.\n\nIn fact, these are some of the exact channels we've used to grow our business to over 33 million monthly visitors.\n\nWe’ll go over some different marketing channels in detail. So you can determine which ones make the most sense for your business.\n\nLet’s start with some basics first.\n\nWhat Is a Marketing Channel?\n\nA marketing channel is a way businesses reach their customers to promote products or services. \n\nThink of them as paths that connect a company to potential buyers. \n\nSome common marketing channels include:\n\nSocial media\nDirect email\nOrganic search\nDigital advertising\n\nThose are all examples of digital marketing. But there’s another type of marketing channel: traditional marketing (ways of marketing that aren’t online like in-person events and billboards).\n\nIn short, marketing channels help companies connect with prospects and drive sales. \n\n8 Marketing Channels to Consider\n\nWhile many of the most effective channels in marketing are digital, we’ve also included a (sometimes) traditional channel that can be quite effective.\n\nSocial Media\n\nSocial media can be a powerful way to connect with your customers. Because they naturally hang out on those platforms in their free time. \n\nNote\n\nThis section is all about organic (unpaid) social media marketing. You can run ads on social media platforms, but that’s considered digital advertising. Which we’ll cover later. \n\nOn social media, you can post content, respond to your followers, and even manage customer service issues. Plus, it’s free to post content.\n\nOne popular brand that uses social media effectively is Nike. They regularly post high-quality photos and videos on Instagram showcasing their products, athletes, and inspirational quotes and stories.\n\nIt's important to choose the right platforms. Because your target audience likely uses some but not others. \n\nTo find out where your audience spends their time, enter a competitor’s domain in One2Target and visit the “Behavior” report.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nHere’s how to start using social media marketing:\n\nChoose the right platforms for your business. Pick ones where your customers are most active.\nCreate business accounts on these platforms. Fill out your profile with complete and accurate information.\nPlan your content. Decide what types of posts you'll share and how often.\nStart posting regularly. Share a mix of informative, entertaining, and promotional content.\nEngage with your followers. And respond to comments and messages promptly.\nUse analytics tools to track your performance and see what works best. So you can adjust over time.\n\nTry Semrush Social’s Social Analytics tool to get insights into your social media performance.\n\nThe tool tracks engagement, reach, and audience growth across your social media platforms.\n\nStreamline Social Media Management\n\nwith a Semrush Social Subscription\n\nStart Free Trial →\nEmail\n\nEmail enables you to reach prospects directly in their inboxes. And it’s one of the best-performing channels—generating $36 for every $1 spent. \n\nUsing emails, you can: \n\nKeep your subscribers informed about new products or services\nShare valuable content that answers your audience’s questions\nOffer special deals or promotions\nReach out to past customers to encourage future purchases\n\nTake the example of beauty brand Sephora. They send regular emails with product recommendations, beauty tips, and exclusive offers. \n\nImage Source: ReallyGoodEmails\n\nMessages like this keep Sephora top of mind and can encourage recipients to make purchases.\n\nOne of the main perks of using email is that you can personalize your messages based on what you know about your customers. Which may improve performance. \n\nHow to Get Started\n\nTo begin with email marketing:\n\nChoose an email service provider that fits your needs and budget. Mailchimp is a popular choice among beginners.\nCreate ways for people to sign up for your emails. You can use pop-up forms or embedded sign-up fields on your website.\nGrow your email list by offering something valuable in exchange for email addresses. You can provide a free ebook, a discount code, etc.\nPlan what types of emails you'll send—newsletters, promotions, updates, etc.\nDesign email templates that match your brand. Most email service providers (including Mailchimp) offer pre-designed templates that you can edit to fit your needs. \nWrite clear and engaging content for your emails\nSend emails regularly, but don't overdo it. Once a week or once every two weeks is often enough.\nUse the analytics your email service provides to see what works best\nAlways include an easy way for people to unsubscribe if they want to\n\nYou can use the AI Writing Assistant to craft compelling email content quickly and easily.\n\nAside from the email body copy, the tool also helps you generate good subject lines and calls to action (CTAs) to improve the effectiveness of your email campaigns.\n\nWrite Your Emails\n\nwith AI Writing Assistant\n\nTry for Free →\nOrganic Search\n\nOrganic search refers to the non-paid search results on search engines like Google and Bing. And it can put you directly in front of users searching topics relevant to your niche—without having to pay for ads.\n\nTo appear in these results, you’ll need to focus on search engine optimization (SEO). Which involves improving your website for search engines and users.\n\nBellroy (a company that sells accessories like wallets, bags, and phone cases) is seeing great results through SEO. \n\nThey appear in the top 100 search engine results for almost 74,000 keywords. Which brings around 370,000 monthly visits to their website, according to Domain Overview.\n\nOrganic search is also valuable in that once your site begins to rank well, you can get traffic for a long time. \n\nHow to Get Started\n\nTo attract traffic from organic search:\n\nDo keyword research to find out what words people use when searching for topics related to your products or services\nCreate high-quality content on your website that uses these keywords naturally\nMake sure your website is free of technical SEO issues\nGet other trusted websites to link to your site. In other words, get backlinks.\nUse tools like Google Search Console and Position Tracking to understand your website’s organic search performance\nRegularly update your content to keep it fresh and relevant\nBe patient—it can take time to see results from SEO efforts\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to find relevant keywords for your business. \n\nIt provides tons of keyword ideas based on a single, broad term you enter.\n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nDigital Advertising\n\nDigital advertising involves showing ads across the web. And it can start driving traffic, leads, and sales almost immediately.\n\nThere are many types of digital ads you can run. For example, you can:\n\nRun text ads to be shown to Google searchers\nDisplay image ads on websites\nShow video ads before, during, and after YouTube videos\nShow sponsored posts on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.\n\nTake Airbnb as an example. They often use colorful, eye-catching ads on social media to show off interesting places to stay.\n\nJust keep in mind that there are costs. \n\nMany ads use a pay-per-click (PPC) model, meaning you pay for every click on one of your ads. And it can get expensive if you don’t carefully manage your campaigns.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nTo run digital advertising campaigns:\n\nChoose where you want to show your ads (Google, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) and create your accounts. These platforms have ad management capabilities.\nDecide what you want to achieve with your ads (e.g., more sales)\nSet a budget for how much you want to spend\nCreate your ad content, which can include ad copy and eye-catching images or videos. You might also want to research your competitors’ ads for inspiration. \nChoose who you want to show your ads to based characteristics like age, location, and interests\nMonitor performance and adjust as needed\n\nWondering how to study your rivals’ ads?\n\nUse the AdClarity – Advertising Intelligence app.\n\nYou can track their ad placements, expenditures, performance, and more to gain valuable insights for your own campaigns. \n\nStudy Rival Ads\n\nwith the AdClarity App\n\nSign Up Now →\nInfluencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing involves working with experts and individuals who have large followings to promote your products or services. Which puts your brand in front of their audiences.\n\nInfluencers can talk about your products or services, show how to use them, or share why they like them. Which can feel more natural and trustworthy to followers than traditional ads.\n\nFor example, many beauty brands work with influencers on social media. These influencers might show how they use the brand's products in their routines.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nTo do influencer marketing:\n\nLook for influencers who have relevant audiences you want to reach\nContact them and discuss the goals you want to achieve with your campaign (like increasing brand awareness or boosting sales)\nDiscuss what you want them to do (like write a post or create a video)\nAgree on payment or other compensation (e.g., free products)\nGive the influencer creative freedom while ensuring they follow any important guidelines\nTrack results to see how successful they’ve been\n\nUse Influencer Analytics to find potential influencers for your brand.\n\nIt provides valuable information about each potential influencer. Like their total follower count, estimated fees for collaborations, etc.\n\nFind Influencers for Your Campaigns\n\nwith Influencer Analytics\n\nTry for Free →\nPodcasts\n\nPodcasts are audio shows that people listen to online. And can be a great way to connect with an entirely new audience to generate brand awareness and loyalty.\n\nYou have three main options:\n\nStart your own podcast\nBe a guest on someone else’s podcast\nAdvertise on other people's podcasts\n\nStarting your own podcast and being featured on someone else’s both let you talk about topics related to your business. Which can add value for listeners and build trust with them\n\nFor example, Basecamp has a podcast called “REWORK” where they discuss entrepreneurship, productivity, and other niche-relevant topics. \n\nAdvertising on other people’s podcasts can also be an effective strategy. Because you can tap into a potentially engaged listener base.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nAssuming you want to produce your own podcast, here’s what to do:\n\nChoose what topics you want to cover. Ideally, your topics should relate to your business in some way. \nGet basic recording equipment like a good microphone and editing software. Audacity is an excellent choice for beginners.\nPlan out your first few episodes and start recording\nUpload your podcast on hosting platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify in addition to your website\nVideo Marketing\n\nVideo marketing involves creating and sharing video content to promote your brand, products, or services. And works especially well when you upload to YouTube.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause people use YouTube as a search engine. Meaning, you can show in the search results when they try to find videos on topics related to your business. \n\nThere are many ways to approach video content:\n\nGive helpful tips related to your industry\nShowcase behind-the-scenes footage of your business\nMake clips that your audience is likely to find funny or interesting\n\nFor example, Blendtec created a series of \"Will It Blend?\" videos where they tried to blend unusual items to show how strong their blenders are. And uploaded them to YouTube. \n\nThese fun videos greatly increased their brand awareness.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nTo get started with video content:\n\nDecide what types of videos would be most interesting to your audience\nStart with a simple setup—even a smartphone can work well\nCreate short, engaging videos\nUse editing software to put your videos together\nChoose where to share your videos (like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram)\nAdd captions to your videos for accessibility\nTrack your performance to see what resonates\nEvents\n\nEvents are online or in-person gatherings where you can connect with prospects. Often in real time—making them great for building relationships. \n\nThere are many types of events you can use for marketing:\n\nTrade shows where you can set up a booth\nWorkshops where you teach people something valuable\nLaunch parties for new products\nOnline certificate courses\n\nFor example, Apple holds annual events to launch new products. To generate excitement and media coverage for their latest devices.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nTo begin using events as a marketing tool:\n\nDecide what type of event fits your business and goals\nChoose a date and venue (or online platform for virtual events)\nPlan your content (e.g., choose speakers, create presentation slides, etc.)\nPromote your event through your website, social media accounts, and email lists\nEngage with attendees and collect contact information\nAfter the event, follow up with attendees to gather feedback and use what you learn to improve future events\n\nUse Semrush Social's Social Poster tool to promote your events across different social platforms. \n\nThis tool can help you efficiently schedule and manage your event-related posts.\n\nGet the Most Out of Your Marketing Channels\n\nAs you've seen, there are many marketing channels you can use to reach your customers and grow your business.\n\nAnd Semrush offers a comprehensive suite of tools to help you maximize your efforts across these channels.\n\nSign up today.\n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign Up Now →",
