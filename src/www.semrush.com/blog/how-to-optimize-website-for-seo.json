  "content": "Optimizing your website for SEO helps you generate more traffic, leads, and conversions without paying for ads.\n\nOrganic search refers to the results that appear on a search engine results page (SERP).\n\nIf you were looking to buy a friend some hypoallergenic jewelry, you might type that into a Google search. \n\nHere are two examples of the results that would appear from your organic search: \n\nBut these efforts rely on a solid SEO strategy and an optimization plan for various factors that affect your search engine rankings. \n\nThis guide explains how to go from beginner to pro and optimize your site in an afternoon. \n\nUnderstanding Search Engine Optimization\n\nSEO is not just one thing. \n\nThere are many ranking factors in search engine algorithms. Each factor plays a role in where your site and specific pages appear in SERPs.\n\nWe’ll address these five key ranking factors:\n\nTechnical SEO: Makes it easy for your website to be crawled and indexed by search engine bots (crawlers)\nOn-page SEO: Makes your content easy to understand for humans and search bots\nContent strategy: Maps your website’s content to relevant keywords and search terms\nOff-page SEO: Establishes site authority to help improve your search rankings\nLocal SEO: Optimizes your site for local search features to increase brand awareness and foot traffic in a physical location\n\nSo now what?\n\nThe following steps will help you learn how to optimize your website for SEO.\n\nStep 1: Audit Your Website\n\nPerform an SEO audit to see where your website should be improved to achieve higher search engine rankings.\n\nIt gives you a place to start and provides a general order of importance for SEO problems your site’s experiencing. \n\nUsing Semrush: \n\nClick “Site Audit” under “On Page & Tech SEO.”\n\nIn the text box, type the URL of your website. Click “Start Audit.”\n\nNote: If you already have a project set up in Semrush, you’ll need to click the blue “+ Create project” in the upper left-hand corner to add a new domain and run a new audit.\n\nIn the “Site Audit Settings” dialog box, select the number of pages you want Semrush to crawl and audit. Click “Start Site Audit.”\n\nTip: The number of pages you select should be more than the total number of pages on your site to make sure you audit every page. You can crawl up to 100 pages with a free account.\n\nPro tip: Once you’re comfortable using Site Audit, you can customize the settings in this dialog box. \n\nSemrush will crawl the pages on your website and review your content, images, and links. \n\nOnce the crawl is complete, click on the project name to see a report like the one below.\n\nAt the bottom of the page, you’ll see a list of “Top Issues.” These will help you prioritize and fix specific problems to optimize your site for SEO.\n\nIn the “Number of issues” column, click on a number to see a detailed list of specific issues that need to be fixed. \n\nAlternatively, look at the prioritization widgets across the top of the Site Audit page. (Click “Overview” to return to see the full list of issues on your website.)\n\nHere, you’ll see issues categorized into three groups:\n\nErrors: Issues that should be addressed immediately and likely have the greatest impact on your site’s SEO performance\nWarnings: Issues that should be fixed but can wait until after the “Errors” are resolved\nNotices: Issues that should (technically) be fixed, but probably won’t significantly affect your SEO performance\n\nWith these issues identified, let’s move on to the SEO work.\n\nWe’ll refer to the results of the Site Audit for the rest of this guide. \n\nFind and Fix Technical SEO Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nStep 2: Fix Technical SEO Issues\n\nTechnical SEO issues affect a search engine’s ability to crawl and index your site. And ultimately, these issues affect your SEO performance.\n\nIf your website can’t be crawled and indexed, then it can’t rank. If it can’t rank, then you can’t expect to get much traffic.\n\nThat’s why we’ll address these issues first. \n\nYou’ll notice that the Site Audit report includes a section called “Thematic Reports.” \n\nOf these reports, we’ll focus on three that include technical SEO errors that should be addressed: “Crawlability,” “HTTPS,” and “Site Performance.”\n\nCrawlability\n\nFirst: What’s a crawler?\n\nSearch engines use crawlers or crawl bots, which are specialized bots that click from page to page across the web to analyze them. \n\nWhen Google crawls your website, it means that they know it exists. It’s on the map. \n\nFrom there, the content can be indexed and ranked—it can appear in SERPs.\n\nBut that won’t happen if it can’t be crawled in the first place.\n\nCrawlability errors and issues include:\n\nRedirects that send users to the wrong page\nPages that can’t be accessed\nPages that have been marked as “noindex,” telling search engines not to include them in the search results\nXML sitemaps that send search bots to incorrect or outdated URLs\n\nReferring back to the “Site Audit” page:\n\nClick the number under “Errors.”\n\nThis takes you to the “Issues” tab and filters the list by “Errors.” Click the “Category” drop-down menu and select “Crawlability.” \n\nHere you’ll see must-fix crawlability problems.\n\nStart by understanding the problem. Click “Why and how to fix it” on the first line item.\n\nIn this case, there are broken JavaScript and/or CSS files. The fix is to remove the reference from the code or update them to point to the correct file.\n\nBut which pages have the problem and which scripts or styles are broken?\n\nClick “XX issues” on the line for the error you’re fixing. \n\nNow you’ll see an itemized list for errors of this type. The “Page URL” column shows which pages contain the broken code. The “Resource URL” column shows what is broken. \n\nTo fix the issue, you might replace the code or update it to point to the correct file. \n\nWhen you’re finished, go back to your list of crawlability errors to work your way through the list. \n\nFurther reading: Crawlability & Indexability: What They Are & How They Affect SEO\n\nHTTPS for Site Security\n\nHaving a secure website can improve your site’s ranking.\n\nPlus it’s good practice to guard against hackers, malware, or other threats. \n\nIf your site doesn’t have a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate in place, the Site Audit tool will let you know.\n\nIn the Site Audit tool, click the “Issues” tab.\n\nClick the “Errors” tab. Then click the “Category” > “Security & HTTPS” (you may have to scroll down to find it).\n\nA report displays any issues there might be with the HTTPS status of your website or specific pages. \n\nClick on each error type to see the problem and instructions for correcting it. \n\nNote: There is some overlap among these categories. If you see errors you’ve already addressed (like in this example), you can ignore them. Or click “Rerun campaign” at the top of the page to re-crawl the website and verify that the problems are fixed. \n\nRepeat the process for each error type.\n\nFurther reading: What Is HTTPS: The Definitive Guide to How HTTPS Works\n\nSite Performance\n\nFaster site speed can improve your site’s search rankings.\n\nThis is because website performance (e.g., page speed) is a Google ranking factor. \n\nPlus, Google data suggests that 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than three seconds to load.\n\nReturn to the “Errors” list in the “Issues” tab. Click “Category” > “Site Performance” (you may have to scroll down to find it).\n\nHere you’ll see issues affecting your site’s load speed. \n\nClick the number to display the list and address the errors.\n\nFurther reading: What Is Page Speed & How to Improve It\n\nFind and Fix Technical Site Issues\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →\nStep 3: Optimize On-Page SEO\n\nOnce technical issues are resolved, improving your page structure, schema markup, and metadata will help to optimize your website for SEO. We call this on-page SEO or on-site SEO.\n\nOn-page SEO affects how bots (search engine crawlers) understand your content and how users experience it. \n\nFor example, search engines use a page’s title tag to determine its content. A title tag helps users understand the content of that page.\n\nKey on-page SEO factors:\n\nMeta tags and indexability: Proper markup helps search engines and users to understand what the page is about\nHeading tags: Descriptive headings (e.g., H1 and H2) structure your page and allow for skimming\nAccessibility: Good alt text (short for alternative text) for images lets people using screen readers hear descriptions of the images\nMobile optimization: Google uses mobile-first indexing, so optimize your site for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets\nMeta Tags & Indexability\n\nWrite your meta tags (meta title and meta description) to make it clear to your target audience and search engines that your page contains content relevant to the topic.\n\nClick “Issues” > “Errors.” Then click “Category” > “Indexability” to check for errors in your HTML header tags, like missing meta descriptions or pages with duplicate title tags. \n\nClick “Why and how to fix it” to learn what the issue is and how to address it. \n\nHeading Tags\n\nEvery page on your website should have a unique H1 tag.\n\nThe Site Audit tool looks for pages that do not contain an H1 tag or that have multiple H1 tags. It also tells you when the same H1 is being used on multiple pages.\n\nH1 issues are a “Warning” rather than an “Error.”\n\nTo see them, leave the “Category” filter set to “Indexability'' from the previous step. Click the “Warnings” tab.\n\nClick on the number to open the list of issues or pages that need attention. \n\nAccessibility\n\nAccessibility is important for user experience. It also aligns with on-page SEO best practices.\n\nIn particular, you should include alt text for all images on your website.\n\nImages with missing alt text (or “alt attributes”) are displayed in “Warnings.”\n\nClick “XX images don’t have alt attributes” to see where you should add an alt attribute. \n\nFurther reading: Alt Text: What Is It & Why It Matters for Accessibility & SEO\n\nMobile Optimization\n\nYour website’s mobile experience will impact your position in SERPs. \n\nIn fact, as of 2021, Google defaults to mobile-first indexing and evaluates your site predominantly from the perspective of a mobile visitor.\n\nBecause of this, it’s important to optimize your website’s design, functionality, and page speed for mobile users.\n\nResponsive design that adapts to different screen sizes will make your content, links, and images usable on most devices. \n\nTo optimize your site for mobile SEO, click the “Errors” tab if you’re not already there, then click “Category” > “Mobile SEO.” (You may have to scroll to find it.)\n\nClick on a number to see a list of issues that could be hurting your site’s mobile SEO.\n\nTip: You can also use Google PageSpeed Insights to get a detailed report on your site’s performance and ways to optimize load speed. \n\nStep 4: Content Strategy\n\nEach page on your site should address a single topic. Page topics are determined by your content strategy. \n\nSay you want to rank for the keyword “grapefruit juice.”\n\nIdentify a single page on your website—maybe your homepage, a blog post, a product page, or a category page—that targets this specific keyword.\n\nThen optimize the page for that specific term.\n\nKeyword Research\n\nConduct keyword research to identify search terms that users type into Google and other search engines.\n\nIdentify the best keywords for each page (after all, not every keyword will be “grapefruit juice”) to create high-quality, valuable content that meets the searcher’s needs and expectations.\n\nUse the Keyword Magic Tool to quickly identify hundreds or even thousands of possible keywords that would make sense for your page or website.\n\nFrom the left-hand navigation, click “Keyword Magic Tool” under “Keyword Research.”\n\nType the topic of your page or website in the text box. Click “Search.” \n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool uses this keyword to generate a list of similar or related suggestions.\n\nKeywords with high search volume are more popular and have a higher potential reward (more traffic). But keyword difficulty (“KD %”) indicates how difficult it will be for your site to rank. \n\nKeywords with a higher KD % are more competitive and you may have a hard time ranking at all (or getting any traffic).\n\nA good strategy includes a mix of high-volume keywords and some lower-volume, long-tail keywords (queries with lower search volume). They may offer less potential traffic, but you might receive more actual traffic because you’re able to rank more easily for these keywords.\n\nYou can filter the keyword suggestions based on the specific terms or phrases they contain. Select a category from the left-hand menu to automatically apply a filter. \n\nChoose at least one keyword for each page on your site.\n\nPro tip: It’s helpful to target multiple keywords and pages within the same topic. We call these topic clusters. \n\nIt might be helpful to create a spreadsheet for each page and the keywords you’re planning to target for each one. This makes content optimization easier. \n\nHow to Optimize Website Content for SEO\n\nTo generate organic traffic (traffic from search engines), your website pages should be optimized for search.\n\nEach page should target one topic. That topic is defined by the primary keyword and one to five secondary keywords from the spreadsheet you created in the research phase.\n\nFor example, say one of your pages targets the topic “blueberry pie.” \n\nPrimary keyword: blueberry pie\nSecondary keywords: blueberry pie recipe, blueberry pie filling, recipe for blueberry pie\n\nOptimize your content for the target keyword by including the keyword in these key places:\n\nTitle tag\nH1 (main heading or headline)\nSubheadings (H2, H3, etc.)\nMeta description\nFirst paragraph of the content\n\nThe Semrush On Page SEO Checker makes it easy to optimize any piece of content by following a step-by-step process.\n\nIn Semrush, click “On Page SEO Checker” from the left-hand navigation menu.\n\nType the URL of your site into the box (i.e., name.com). Click “Get ideas.”\n\nNote: If you already have an existing project in Semrush, click “+ Create project” to add a new one and run a new report.\n\nIn the “Select target location” dialog box, click the drop-down menu to choose a location, language, and device for the audit. Click “Continue.”\n\nNote: If these options feel overwhelming, keep the default setting and click “Continue.”\n\nOn the “Add pages to optimize” screen, click the “Manually” tab. Then type or paste the URL of the page you’re optimizing. Type the primary keyword in the “For keyword” text box. Click “Add Page.”\n\nNote: If you’re new to SEO optimization, select “Auto Import” to see a list of recommended pages and keywords on your website. \n\nOnce you’ve added all the pages you’re optimizing, click “Collect ideas.”\n\nNow you’ll see the results in the “On Page SEO Checker” report.\n\nReview each page in the “TOP pages to optimize” list or click the “Optimization Ideas” tab.\n\nClick the green button that says “X ideas” for specific action items.\n\nThe tool provides recommendations for using your target keyword (e.g., in the H1). It’ll also look for instances of keyword stuffing, which means the keyword has been overused or used in an unnatural way.\n\nHere is an example of recommendations for improvement.\n\nYou’ll see a list of related keywords you can add to your text to further optimize it. These recommendations are based on topics covered in high-quality content on this same subject. In-depth coverage of the topic and related subtopics can help your content rank higher.\n\nFor additional help with the body copy or main content on the page, try using the SEO Writing Assistant. This tool provides a score based on your content’s readability, SEO, originality, and tone of voice. It also recommends specific steps for improvement.\n\nAs part of your content marketing strategy, use these SEO tools to plan and optimize new pages on your website.They help to ensure that all of your new pages follow best practices and have the best chance of ranking for target search queries. \n\nStep 5: Improve Off-Page SEO\n\nOff-page SEO helps search engines and users see your website as trustworthy and authoritative. This is accomplished with an SEO strategy that includes link building—links from other reputable websites that point to your website and boost your site’s authority. \n\nSo let’s talk about backlinks and internal linking. \n\nBacklinks\n\nThe more high-quality links that point to your site, the higher your content will rank.\n\nThat’s the general rule. It’s not always a perfect correlation.\n\nBacklinks, often referred to as inbound links, act as endorsements or upvotes for your website. So, the more links you have, the more endorsements you’ve received. This is often called “authority,” “site authority,” or “domain authority.”\n\nSearch engines use these signals to help determine the quality of your content and how well you rank in search engines.\n\nUsing the On Page SEO Checker in Semrush, click the “Optimization Ideas” tab. \n\nClick the “X ideas” button, then scroll to see a section for “Backlinks.”\n\nThis section recommends websites that could link to your site. \n\nHow do you earn backlinks?\n\nHere are a few proven methods:\n\nWrite a guest post: Submit an article to the website and include a link to your website\nPromote a relevant resource: Create a resource, article, or original data set that other websites might want to reference and link to\nAsk for a link: Reach out to someone from the website and ask them to add a link to a relevant page or article on your website\nInternal Linking\n\nInternal links from one page on your website to another page on your website help to strengthen your site’s authority.\n\nInclude at least one internal link on every page of your website. Even better, include five or six links per page.\n\nInternal links guide visitors deeper into your site, increase page views, and reduce the bounce rate.\n\nThey also distribute the authority from incoming links to other pages on your site. (We sometimes call this “link equity” or “link juice.”) Think of it as a vote of confidence or a testimonial. When one page ranks well on Google or backlinks from other sites, it is sharing that vote of confidence with internally linked pages. This helps more pages rank better in the organic search results. \n\nStep 6: Local SEO Optimization\n\nLocal SEO optimizes your website and your business for local searchers.\n\nThink “food near me.”\n\nThere are specific considerations for local businesses because SERPs for local queries look a bit different. \n\nSERPs highlight local businesses based on a combination of proximity to the searcher and the other SEO factors that we covered in previous steps:\n\nKeyword relevance\nOn-page SEO\nContent optimization\nMobile-friendliness\nSite performance\nQuality of backlinks\nQuality of internal links\nAccessibility\n\nWhen optimizing your website for local SEO, focus on your Google Business Profile and managing reviews.\n\nGoogle Business Profile\n\nGoogle Business Profile (formerly Google My Business or GMB) is a listing you create with information about your business. It’s free, but you do need to set it up. \n\nYour Google Business Profile allows you to add information like your location, services, products, and prices. You can also add photos.\n\nTo provide relevant information to potential customers in your local area, follow our guide on setting up your Google Business Profile.\n\nUse the Semrush Listing Management tool to optimize your profile. \n\nManaging Reviews\n\nThe number and quality of reviews that your local business receives can impact your local SEO.\n\nThey aren’t a direct ranking factor, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t important for local SEO.\n\nPositive reviews convey trust to potential customers.\n\nThey increase the likelihood that a searcher will choose your business from the list of local options. \n\nRemember that responding to reviews—both positive and negative—shows that your business is committed to customer service and satisfaction.\n\nUse the Review Management tool to easily monitor and respond to online reviews.\n\nStart with a Plan\n\nOptimizing your website for SEO is complex. There are many moving parts that all work together to make SEO work for your business.\n\nHaving a clear action plan makes it easier to get started. \n\nBefore you dive into optimizing your site, use the Site Audit tool as a roadmap. The Site Audit report will help you understand exactly what needs to be done on your site, how to fix it, and what impact it might have on your rankings.\n\nYou won’t get lost along the way.\n\nOptimize your Website\n\nwith the Site Audit Tool\n\nTry for Free →",
