  "content": "What Is an Editorial Calendar?\n\nAn editorial calendar is a visual document that helps you plan and manage your content production workflow periodically. \n\nIt outlines: \n\nWhat your content will be about\nWhere and when you’ll publish it\nWho’s responsible for creating it\n\nAn editorial calendar can be the go-to place for planning, managing, and coordinating the different stages of content creation. Like brainstorming topics, assigning them to authors, scheduling content delivery and publication deadlines, and tracking task progress. \n\nIn this article, we’ll explore the types, components, and benefits of editorial calendars, followed by steps to build one efficiently.\n\nWhat Should an Editorial Calendar Include?\n\nAn editorial calendar typically factors in:\n\nTopics: The subject matter of each content piece. For example, “healthy eating tips.”\nType: The format of the content you produce. Like ebooks, blog posts, whitepapers, print articles, social media posts, email newsletters or campaigns, podcast episodes, etc.\nDue date: The deadline for when the content requires completion\nPublish date: The date when the content will go live and appear online\nOwner: The person responsible for creating or managing the content\nStatus: The current stage of the content, such as “In progress”, “Waiting”, “Stuck,” “Published.”\n\nLike this:\n\nYou can also include other elements, depending on your specific content workflow. For instance, adding a column that explains how you plan to promote your content across different channels. \n\nWhat are the Benefits of an Editorial Calendar?\n\nAn editorial calendar can help content marketing teams:\n\nStay organized: You can coordinate and manage your team’s content-related tasks from one central location\nImprove team collaboration: Team members can clearly see their responsibilities, monitor task progress, and stay on top of upcoming deadlines\nManage resources efficiently: Using an editorial calendar lets you plan better for resources needed for your upcoming content production, including budget, people, and tools \nTrack past performance: Content marketing teams will be able to analyze their historical performance. For instance, how many content pieces they planned to publish versus how many they actually published in the last quarter. This can help them identify and fix issues in their content production pipeline.\nPlan content strategically: An editorial calendar helps you see how each piece of content fits into the larger strategy\nEstablish & maintain publishing frequency: Your team can align on a clear plan for regular content creation. The calendar acts as both a strategic content planning tool and a coordination hub to ensure a consistent schedule.\nManage and meet deadlines: Pre-planned due dates and task assignments make coordination easier. So that work stays on track without last-minute rushes. \nTypes of Editorial Calendars\n\nYou can create separate editorial calendars for different content formats, channels, or teams.\n\nFor example, a social media marketing team will draw up a social media-specific editorial calendar. It can also build a separate calendar for the group responsible for blog post production.\n\nHere are four different types of editorial calendars you can build for your content.\n\n1. Blog Post Editorial Calendar\n\nA blog post editorial calendar lets you plan, manage, and coordinate the creation and publication of content on your blog. Helping you maintain a consistent publishing schedule.\n\nWhen you regularly post fresh, high-quality content—including blog posts—search engines may recognize your site as an authoritative source of information. Which can improve your search engine rankings.\n\nA blog post editorial calendar may include additional elements. Like target keyword, featured image, title tag, etc.\n\nKeyword: The term or phrase your post targets for blog search engine optimization (SEO). By optimizing your content for this keyword, you improve its chances of ranking higher in search engine results pages (SERPS) when users search for the term.\n\nSearch volume: The number of searches the target keyword receives each month. It can be location-specific (for targeting audiences in specific regions) or global (for reaching a worldwide audience).\n\nTitle tag: The HTML element that specifies to search engines and internet browsers what webpage title to display. It can appear in search engine results and page link previews.\n\nMeta description: The HTML element that provides a short summary of the webpage. This can appear below the title tag on SERPs.\n\nFeatured image: The main image associated with the blog post, often appearing at the top of the post and in previews on social media and other platforms\n\nUse Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to identify the most promising and relevant keywords for your business. \n\nPerform Keyword Research\n\nwith the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nTry for Free →\n\nEnter a broad term related to your business/product/service in the tool. And select your target country (e.g., U.S.). \n\nYou can include your website’s URL in the “Enter domain for personalized data” field. To understand how challenging it might be for your site to rank for these keywords.\n\nClick “Search.”\n\nThe tool will present a list of related keywords. Along with additional information like:\n\nVolume, or monthly search volume\nKeyword Difficulty (KD%): How difficult it is to rank for a specific keyword\nPersonalized Keyword Difficulty (PKD%): How hard it would be for your domain to rank in the top 10 search results for a given keyword\nIntent: Why users search for the keyword in question\n\nAnd more.\n\nFrom here, you can use filters to find the best keywords for your business needs.\n\nFor instance, filter by “Intent” to identify keywords with high-purchase intent—namely the terms labeled “Commercial” or “Transactional.” \n\nUse the PKD% filter to identify easy-to-rank-for keywords for your site.\n\nYou can also apply a combination of filters to identify the most relevant keywords to include in your editorial calendar. \n\nFurther reading: How to Use Semrush for Keyword Research\n\n2. Podcast Editorial Calendar\n\nRunning a podcast is a great way to position your brand as an authoritative and credible source of information in your industry. \n\nBesides the elements listed under “What Should an Editorial Calendar Include?”, a podcast editorial calendar can also feature the following:\n\nScript link: A URL or link to the script document for each episode. This allows team members to easily access and review the content planned for recording.\nInterviewee details: Information about guests on the podcast, such as their names, email addresses, and social media handles. This helps you coordinate with them and promote the episode effectively.\nSponsor: Details about any sponsors for individual episodes. Including the sponsor's name and the specifics of the sponsorship deal, like what mentions or promotions the sponsor will receive during the episode.\nOriginal audio link: A link to the raw, unedited audio file of the podcast episode—useful for review and editing purposes\nFinal audio link: A link to the completed, ready-to-publish audio file of the podcast episode. This is the polished version you’ll upload for listeners.\n\nTip\n\nUse Podcast Hosting from Semrush’s App Center to streamline your podcast production process. The tool lets you automatically transcribe podcast episodes and convert video recordings to audio. Plus identify relevant keywords from your podcast to optimize your descriptions, excerpts, and transcripts for search engines. And even evaluate your podcast's performance.\n\n3. Downloadable Assets Editorial Calendar\n\nYou can create a separate editorial calendar for downloadable assets such as ebooks, whitepapers, and user manuals.\n\nIt’s possible to combine this with your blog post calendar—both are website resources. But managing one calendar for both might get confusing if you have a high volume of content production. A separate calendar helps keep things clear and organized.\n\nHere are some elements you can add to your editorial calendar for downloadable assets:\n\nDocument link: The link to the working document where the asset is developed. So team members can access and contribute to the content before it's finalized.\nPDF file link: Once the asset is complete, it’s often converted to PDF format for distribution. This link provides direct access to the final PDF file, ready for sharing or uploading to your website.\nDownload URL: The direct link where the end users can download the asset. It's typically hosted on your website or a platform that handles downloads, such as a content management system or a file-sharing service.\nThank you page URL: After downloading the asset, users are often directed to a 'thank you' page. This URL might include additional user engagement elements like related resources, signup forms, or further instructions.\n4. Social Media Editorial Calendar\n\nSocial media marketing teams usually have a large publishing cadence. Using a social media editorial calendar can help them stay organized. \n\nOther elements that can feature in a social media editorial calendar are:\n\nSocial network: The social media platform where you’ll post your content. Like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and so on.\nImage/video link: A link to the visual content that will accompany the post\nCaption: The text that will accompany the image or video\nHashtag(s): The hashtag(s) you want to include in the post\nTagged user: Any relevant users or partner brands you plan to tag in the post\n\nSemrush’s Social Poster makes it easy to build and manage an editorial calendar for social media teams. \n\nYou can use other social media tools from the Semrush Social Toolkit to manage your social media marketing efforts from a single interface. Including Social Inbox (to respond to comments or messages) and Social Analytics (to track your social media performance across multiple platforms). \n\nHow to Create an Editorial Calendar in 7 Steps\n\nTo build a winning editorial calendar, begin by replicating our free editorial calendar template. It’s available as a Google Sheets document. \n\nIn this template, you’ll find two tabs.\n\nContent calendar: Contains elements you can can use for all kinds of content calendars, no matter the format \nAdditional fields: Components for adding information specific to the content formats and channels we outlined in the previous section\n\nKeep this template by your side as you follow the below steps for how to make an editorial calendar to fit your needs.\n\n1. Build Your Content Marketing Strategy\n\nYour editorial calendar should closely align with your content marketing strategy. In other words, it has to reflect your content marketing goals, target audience, and content distribution channels.\n\nSo, first lay out your strategy before working on your content calendar.\n\nA content marketing strategy is a plan designed to create and share content that resonates with your target audience and supports your business objectives. Documenting it properly increases your chances of marketing success.\n\nProceed to define these key components of your content marketing strategy:\n\nGoals: Clearly articulate what you aim to achieve with your content marketing efforts. This could be increasing brand awareness, driving traffic to your website, and generating leads. Your content marketing goals should directly tie in with your business objectives. \nAudience personas: Gain a deep understanding of your target audience, including their needs, interests, and behaviors. This information can help you create content that is relevant and valuable to them.\nOnline channels: Identify the best channels where you plan to publish content. Like social media platforms, blogs, websites, and email newsletters. Choose channels that your audience uses frequently and makes purchasing decisions on.\nDistribution: Build a plan to promote your content to reach a wider audience—potentially increasing your marketing performance\n\nFurther reading: The Ultimate Guide to Creating a Content Marketing Strategy\n\n2. Assess Your Budget & Available Resources\n\nTake into account your monthly/quarterly content marketing budget. Plus the resources at your disposal. \n\nThis assessment can give you an idea of how many content pieces you can realistically produce or commission. And the quality you’re able to maintain. \n\nConsider the following factors to see what you’re working with and it what it can achieve for your business:\n\nBudget: Determine your total budget for content production. Such as costs for hiring writers, designers, videographers, and any tools or software you need.\nHuman resources: Identify the team members available to create content—including different people with different skills—like content writers, copywriters, graphic designers, and team coordinators. \nTools and software: List all the tools and software required for content creation, management, and distribution. This could include SEO tools, content management systems, graphic design software, and social media scheduling tools.\nExisting content library: When starting out, you might have limited resources for producing new content. Revisit your existing content library to find pieces you can repurpose—saving you time, money, additional resources, and effort. \n3. Identify Digital Marketing Channels to Target\n\nIt’s important to identify the best digital marketing channels—or digital advertising channels—for your business at this stage. So you can reach your audience where they hang out. \n\nDetermine which channels you can realistically focus on, budget- and resource-wise, to achieve your business and content marketing goals effectively. Examine whether you’ll be able to meet these goals with what you have available. \n\nFor instance, if your budget is low and your content marketing goals are highly ambitious, you may need to adjust your expectations.\n\nHere are some digital marketing channels to consider.\n\nOrganic Search\n\nOrganic search refers to unpaid listings that show up in search results. By creating and optimizing your content for search engines to find and rank it, you can improve your site’s organic search visibility. And drive more traffic as a result. \n\nFor example, Oracle’s blog post titled “What Is Big Data?” holds the No. 1 position in organic search for the keyword “what is big data.”\n\nSo why organic search?\n\nBecause billions of people use search engines to find information. \n\nBy targeting keywords your target audience searches for, you have a better chance of boosting your online brand visibility and attracting more organic traffic. Potentially resulting in higher conversions.\n\nSocial Media\n\nBillions of people use social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. They offer an effective way to reach your target audience and engage with them directly. \n\nRegularly posting quality content on your social media platforms can help you: \n\nBuild a loyal following\nIncrease brand awareness\nBoost site visits\n\nBut which platform(s) should you establish your presence on?\n\nFocus on social media channels where your target audience not only spends time but also makes buying decisions.\n\nFor example, if your target audience includes B2B professionals, it may be better to choose LinkedIn over TikTok. Because even though they might be using TikTok for entertainment, they’re more likely using LinkedIn to discover professional tools and services.\n\nEmail\n\nClose to 4.5 billion people use email to communicate. Making it a key platform for reaching and engaging with your audience.\n\nYou can use email to promote your products. Here’s an example from tech brand OnePlus:\n\nYou can also educate your audience via email. \n\nCheck out this email from crowdfunding platform Ketto HealthFirst about how to protect your skin in summer: \n\nPodcast Streaming Platforms\n\nYou can use streaming platforms like Spotify or Apple Podcasts to reach podcast listeners—that’s more than 460 million people worldwide. And connect with potential customers.\n\nImagine you run a fitness coaching business.\n\nBy hosting a podcast that covers topics like workout routines, nutrition tips, and interviews with fitness experts, you could attract an audience interested in health and fitness. \n\nThis not only helps you build a community of fitness enthusiasts, but drives interest toward your fitness coaching business.\n\nCheck out this podcast from the Colossus Fitness brand, which offers fitness coaching programs:\n\n4. Determine Your Publishing Cadence\n\nNext, determine how many posts you can publish on each channel. You can plan this monthly or quarterly, depending on what works best for your strategy.\n\nTake into account your overall content production budget. \n\nSuppose you have a $10,000 monthly budget for content production. Here’s how you can allocate it across your chosen channels and content formats:\n\nChannel\n\n\t\n\nContent Format\n\n\t\n\nBudget\n\n\n\n\nOrganic search\n\n\t\n\nBlog post\n\n\t\n\n$6,000\n\n\n\n\nSocial media\n\n\t\n\nSocial media posts\n\n\t\n\n$2,000\n\n\n\n\nPodcast streaming platforms\n\n\t\n\nPodcast episodes\n\n\t\n\n$2,000\n\nIf your monthly budget for blog post production is $6,000, consider hiring two freelance writers who charge $1,000 per blog post. Assign two pieces per writer, totaling four posts per month—and publish on a weekly cadence. \n\nThis will cost you $4,000. \n\nYou can allocate the remaining $2,000 to hiring an editor who will polish these posts so they’re ready for publication. \n\nIn addition to freelancers, factor in the capacity of your in-house writers to determine how many more posts they can create.\n\nNote: In-house content production doesn’t come for free. Business owners are still paying for the time spent on writing these posts.\n\nSimilarly, you can determine your publishing cadence for your other online channels. \n\n5. Establish a Content Production Workflow\n\nDevelop a step-by-step process for content production. Include the following key elements for a seamless workflow. \n\nKeyword research: Find the best keywords for your business. Use Semrush’s keyword research tools to guide you. Like Keyword Magic Tool (for keyword suggestions), Keyword Strategy Builder (to create SEO topic clusters), and Keyword Gap (to identify competitors’ keywords that you don’t target).\n\nTopic generation: Use the keywords you’ve identified to brainstorm topics around which to create content. Semrush’s Topic Research tool helps you generate ideas for engaging content. \n\nContent creation: Assign the topics to your writers or content creators. Provide them with clear guidelines, including keyword usage, tone of voice, and any specific points to cover. This stage involves writing, designing, or recording the content. Use Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant to optimize your content for search engines. \n\nEditing and review: Once the content is created, it should go through an editing and review process to get it to a publishable state.\n\nApproval: Get final approval from relevant stakeholders. This might include managers, clients, or team leads who need to sign off on the content before it goes live. \n\nScheduling: Schedule your content to ensure you publish it according to plan. Consider Semrush’s Social Poster to help you organize your social media content scheduling. \n\nPromotion: Plan how you’ll disseminate each piece of content across various channels. This could include promoting your content via emails, using paid advertising, or other online channels. \n\n6. Choose the Right Editorial Calendars for Your Needs\n\nYou can create separate editorial calendars for your different content formats, channels, or teams. \n\nFor instance, you can have one editorial calendar for blog posts and another for ebooks—even though you’ll use both to improve your visibility in organic search. \n\nUse our editorial calendar template to build as many different editorial calendars as you need. \n\nHere’s how.\n\nOpen the template and select “Make a copy.”\n\nNavigate to the “Content Calendar” tab to start building your editorial calendar. \n\nFind the elements specific to your content formats in the “Additional Fields” tab. \n\nLet’s say you plan to create a podcast editorial calendar. \n\nFirst, duplicate the “Content Calendar” tab—let’s name it “Podcast Editorial Calendar.”\n\nThen, navigate to the “Additional Fields” tab. And copy the elements dedicated to podcasts. \n\nPaste these elements inside the “Podcast Editorial Calendar” tab. \n\nConsider adding, reorganizing, or removing specific elements to match your workflow. \n\nSimilarly, you can create dedicated workflows for blog posts, downloadable assets, social media, videos, etc.\n\nTip\n\nYou can also use project management tools like Monday.com, ClickUp, and Asana to build and manage your editorial calendars. Consider importing our free Google Sheets editorial calendar into your chosen project management software and build on that. \n\n7. Share Your Editorial Calendar\n\nShare your editorial calendar(s) with your team members. Especially those who’ll directly collaborate with you on content production. \n\nAlso, share it with all freelancers and contractors involved. \n\nYou can also give editorial calendar visibility to other departments, like sales and customer service. It can help position the content team as a critical part of the company’s pipeline- and revenue-building engine. \n\nEncourage different teams to use your content in their daily operations. By integrating your content into various aspects of the business, you help it reach its full potential. \n\nFor example, a sales team can use blog posts, ebooks, and other materials as part of their sales collateral to educate prospects and close deals. \n\nHere’s a post sharing the Semrush blog’s content marketing strategy guide with our LinkedIn followers:\n\nCustomer service can use readily available content to answer common questions, provide support, and enhance the customer experience.\n\nContinuously Refine Your Editorial Calendar\n\nYour content production workflow will likely change over time as you adjust to new trends, technologies, and team dynamics. So, regularly review and adjust your editorial calendar while making sure it helps you meet your goals. \n\nSemrush offers more than 55 digital marketing tools you can use to establish a solid brand presence across different online channels. \n\nSign up for a free Semrush account to plan, create, and execute your content marketing campaigns effectively. \n\nAccess 55+ Tools\n\nwith a Free Semrush Account\n\nSign up Now →",
