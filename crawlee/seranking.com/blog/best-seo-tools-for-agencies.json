User management: Each of the tools we found enables teams to collaborate efficiently and share data and tasks with colleagues and clients. SEO reporting: We prioritized optimization tools for customizable and comprehensive SEO reports. SEO integrations and API: We looked for platforms that offer robust API capabilities and seamless integrations with other tools. User-friendly interface and easy onboarding: We looked for solutions that offer intuitive interfaces, quick-start guides, and clear explanations. Flexible pricing: We chose tools that offer various pricing options to meet agencies’ SEO needs and fits their budget. Now, let’s see if the software we chose meets these criteria. 1. SE Ranking SE Ranking is well-suited for small to mid-sized agencies and in-house teams. It provides pro SEO performance tracking tools and streamlines workflows through White Label, unlimited automatic reporting, lead generation, and more, all available within its Agency Pack. The platform brings comprehensive SEO analytics tools to the table: Keyword Rank Tracker Keyword and Competitive Research Tools Website Audit On-page SEO Checker Backlink Checker and Gap Analyzer And much more! The platform also has tools for SEO content creation (Content editor and AI Writer), and local marketing. SE Ranking has one of the fastest-growing databases and regularly refines its algorithms, incorporating AI technologies, ​​all to ensure your agency analytics and SEO metrics are accurate and up to date. You can share 3-5 manager seats (depending on your plan) with your team. Extra manager seats cost just $20. With Agency Pack, you’ll get 10 client seats with customizable access. You can also send out guest links, offering view-only access. SE Ranking offers a robust SEO Report builder with over 12 ready-to-go templates. The platform allows for unlimited manual reporting or 5-50 automated reports per month (depending on your subscription). The Agency Pack offers unlimited automatic reporting. You can connect SE Ranking to Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Google Business Profile, Looker Studio, Matomo Analytics, etc. SEO API is available through the Business pricing plan. With the White Label feature, you can remove all references to SE Ranking, customize the interface with your agency’s brand elements, set up white-label reporting, etc. All White Label SEO tools are available as part of SE Ranking’s Agency Pack. SE Ranking also helps you generate new SEO leads with its Lead Generator available with Agency Pack. You can embed an On-Page Checker widget on your website offering a free page audit to your prospects. In return, you’ll get the same report plus their contact information to craft better SEO proposals. SE Ranking has a catalog of top SEO agencies where you can be featured to expand your reach. The tool features intuitive UI and has step-by-step onboarding. SE Ranking also offers team training sessions led by company experts as well as email and chat support. Pricing: Pro: $109.00/month Business: $239.00/month With annual subscriptions, you’ll get 20% off. SE Ranking also provides a free 14-day trial. Its special Agency Pack is available for $50/month with an annual subscription to its Pro and Business plans. Pros and cons: ✅ Comprehensive tools for SEO with one of the best Rank Tracker ✅ Reliable data and top-notch algorithms ✅ Flexible system for team and client access ✅ User-friendly interface and streamlined reporting ✅ Agency-specific features available ✅ Generous and flexible pricing ❌Learning curve when accessing advanced features ❌Automatic scheduled reports come with some limits ❌Some agency-related features cost extra Verdict: SE Ranking has an extensive suite of SEO tools, all powered by its reliable data, advanced algorithms, and top-notch technologies. This ensures that agencies can access both the breadth and depth required to drive successful SEO campaigns. SE Ranking’s strengths outweigh its minor limitations, making this SEO platform one of the best SEO software for agencies. 2. AgencyAnalytics AgencyAnalytics is a comprehensive SEO analytics platform designed for marketing agencies. This is an excellent SEO agency software for anyone who needs a tool with robust reporting capabilities. AgencyAnalytics includes: Rank Tracker Backlink Monitor Site Auditor Automated Reporting With the Freelance pricing plan, the tool offers five staff seats, and with higher plans, you have unlimited staff seats. Client seats are limitless regardless of your subscription type. You can share access to the platform with custom user permissions. AgencyAnalytics also allows you to create tasks, assign them to team members, and track their progress. The platform supports various report types, including PPC, email, SEO review, call tracking, social, ecommerce reports, etc. With its customizable widgets, drag-and-drop features, and embeddable content, you can tailor each report to your client’s unique needs. Scheduled reports are unlimited regardless of your pricing plan, but AgencyAnalytics’ advanced features (cross-campaign reports, report approval, custom metrics) are only available in its more expensive pricing plans. You can create client dashboards, customize them to your client’s goals, and share via link. You can also create different goals and track their progress. AgencyAnalytics has 75+ integrations. Its API is available only within the Enterprise pricing plan. With this tool, you can white-label dashboards and reports. The higher the plan, the more while-labeling options you’ll access. AgencyAnalytics’ dashboards are sleek and intuitive. The platform is designed with user-friendliness in mind, ensuring that even the most complex data is presented clearly and easily. Pricing: Freelancer: $12/month per client campaign (5 client campaigns purchase required). Agency Plan: $18/month per client campaign (10 client campaigns purchase required). Enterprise Plan: This plan has custom pricing and requires you to purchase a minimum of 50+ client campaigns. The platform offers 2 free months if you buy its annual subscriptions. It also has a 14-day free trial. AgencyAnalytics Rank Tracker and Site Audit come as add-ons at $50/month each. Pros and cons: ✅ Unlimited and customizable reporting ✅ Unlimited client seats ✅ User-friendly interface ✅ Task and goal tracking ✅ Multiple integrations ❌ Limited number of SEO tools ❌ Rank Tracker and Site Audit cost extra ❌ Advanced features tied to price ❌ Minimum purchase requirement Verdict: AgencyAnalytics is probably the best SEO tool for agencies that require robust reporting features. It offers customizable dashboards, task and goal-tracking features, seamless client interactions, and much more. On the other hand, AgencyAnalytics could certainly afford to catch up to some of its competitors in terms of the number of SEO tools offered. 3. Screaming Frog Screaming Frog is one of the best technical SEO audit tools. Agencies can use this software to quickly crawl their clients’ websites, identify common SEO issues, fix them, and optimize these sites. While tools like SE Ranking allow agencies to run quick and easy scheduled audits with an attractive dashboard for client presentations, Screaming Frog performs more complex, in-depth audits, often used for internal linking audits. The tool runs comprehensive site crawls to detect issues with metadata, response codes, broken links, duplicate content, redirects, and more. You can also generate XML sitemaps, customize audits according to your needs, perform custom searches, etc. Screaming Frog has recently launched several useful features, including a ChatGPT integration, n-gram analysis, Local Lighthouse integration, aggregator anchor text filter, and more. However, the tool doesn’t offer solutions for rank tracking, keyword and competitive research, or backlink checking. It only focuses on website audits. With Screaming Frog, you can report on anything related to the site’s technical health. It also lets you schedule crawls and export data automatically to any location. One downside is that it takes considerable effort to transform Screaming Frog’s findings into a user-friendly report (or dashboard) for clients. The tool also integrates with GA4, GSC, PageSpeed Insights, Link Metrics, and other APIs with a paid license. Screaming Frog doesn’t offer white-label SEO software tools and has no agency-related features. Its outdated interface and navigation lack user-friendliness and have a learning curve. Pricing Free version: Crawl 500 URLs per website Paid version: $259/year/user (no monthly payment option). Pros and cons: ✅Powerful crawler with extensive customization ✅In-depth website data for effective technical audits ✅ Free version ❌ No White Label feature ❌ More advanced features come with a paid plan ❌ Outdated interface ❌ Focuses exclusively on website crawling and auditing Verdict: While Screaming Frog suits agencies requiring in-depth technical SEO audits, consider buying additional tools or all-in-one SEO platforms if you need more SEO tools and agency-specific functionalities to run your business. 4. Semrush Semrush is a popular SEO software for agencies with 55+ tools for SEO, content marketing, competitor analysis, and PPC. It also has an Agency Growth Kit with specialized capabilities. Semrush offers a wealth of tools for: Competitive Research Keyword Research Link-building Technical SEO Analysis It also covers content optimization, and distribution as well as market analysis features, PPC keyword research data, social media management, and more. This software for SEO agencies has a pretty extensive database, comprising more than 25 billion keywords and covering 190 different regions and countries. Semrush will only give you one user seat. If you need more, get ready to pay from $45 to $100/ month per user. Its Agency Growth Kit includes CRM and Client Manager. You can assign projects and reports to each client, connect projects from Semrush to client pages, manage user group access, and set up alerts for real-time updates. Semrush provides ‘set-and-forget’ reports that can be branded, customized, and scheduled. The number of scheduled reports depends on your subscription (5/20/50). Its Client Portal allows for personalized and automated client interactions. But this will come at an additional cost. Semrush offers API and supports various integrations, including Google products, Looker Studio, social networks, etc. You can’t white-label the Semrush platform, but you can customize your Client Portal and create white-label reports through it. This feature is only available in the Agency Growth Kit. Semrush lets you create a dedicated page on the Agency Partners platform that you can use to attract new clients. Its Marketing Calendar feature lets you view all marketing activities in one centralized location. The platform’s interface can sometimes feel cumbersome. But once you get past the learning curve, the tool’s extensive capabilities become highly rewarding. Pricing: Pro: $129.95/month Guru: $249.95/month Business: $499.95/month You can get a 17% discount if you pay annually. Its Pro and Guru plans also offer a 7-day free trial. Agency Growth Kit comes in two plans: Start: $69/month (available for Pro plan users). Scale: $149/month (available for all three plans). Pros and cons: ✅ Extensive toolset ✅ Big datasets ✅ Customizable reporting ✅ Agency-specific features ✅ Client portal to share progress with clients ❌ Learning curve for accessing advanced features ❌ Limited number of users per plan ❌ More expensive than other tools ❌ Costs can add up with additional features Verdict: Semrush has an incredibly diverse collection of tools, vast datasets, customizable reporting features, and an Agency Growth Kit. On the other hand, its complex interface can make it challenging for newcomers to the platform. Agencies also need to be prepared for additional expenses as their teams grow and as they opt for more advanced features. 5. Ahrefs Ahrefs is an invaluable resource if your main focus is on building and implementing link-building strategies. Ahrefs has over 30 specialized tools to help agencies solve their clients’ SEO tasks. Key features include: Site Explorer Site Audit Keywords Explorer Content Explorer Rank Tracker Its dashboard allows for unlimited verified projects and 5-100 verified projects (depending on your plan). Ahrefs categorizes users as Inactive, Casual, or Power, all based on their monthly credit consumption. One credit is consumed whenever they open a report, apply filters, or request additional data. Each pricing plan comes with only 1 Power user and 500-750 credits/month, depending on your subscription. Additional Power users will cost you $50/month/user. Ahrefs currently lacks built-in SEO reporting features. API access is exclusive to the Enterprise package and has a unit-based costing structure. Integration with GSC, GA4, and Looker Studio is also possible. But you will only have access to Looker Studio if you purchase the Advanced package or higher. Ahrefs doesn’t offer white-labeling features at this time and its agency-related tools are pretty limited. The tool has a steeper learning curve compared to its rivals because it lacks visualization. Once you get used to the somewhat dated interface, the navigation becomes seamless and the tools become highly functional. Pricing: Lite: $129/month Standard: At $249/month Advanced: At $449/month Enterprise: At $14,990/year No matter the plan, you’ll always start off with one Power user, and with limited credits. Ahrefs also offers two months for free if you pay annually. No free trial is available. Pros and cons: ✅ Extensive toolset for diverse SEO tasks ✅ Rapid web crawling capabilities ✅ Robust databases ✅ Free view-only access for additional users ❌ Lack of built-in SEO reporting ❌ No white-labeling options ❌ Steep learning curve ❌ Some features and user seats cost extra ❌ No free trial to test the tool Verdict: Ahrefs is one of the best tools for your SEO firm, especially if you focus on link-building. On the flip side, Ahrefs’ lack of built-in SEO reporting and white-labeling options can be a sticking point for some companies. 6. WebCEO WebCEO is a digital marketing platform for businesses, marketing agencies, and freelancers. It offers basic SEO tools and features that make automation and collaboration easier for agencies. WebCEO equips users with 23 different SEO tools. Its core ones are: Rank Tracking Tool Keyword Research Tool Technical Audit Tool Backlink Checker Tool The platform also offers Traffic Analysis SEO Tools, an SEO Content Assistant, and more. WebCEO features an SEO Task Manager that enables you to allocate tasks to team members and track their progress. It’s especially helpful when your team works remotely. Depending on your plan, you can add 5 to 10 extra users at no cost (additional cost $5/month/user). The tool provides customizable, branded SEO reports that can be scheduled and emailed directly to clients via your own SMTP server. It integrates with platforms like Majestic, MOZ, Google products, and even social media sites at no extra cost. API provides remote access to SEO report data for Agency Unlimited subscribers. By purchasing the Agency Unlimited plan for an additional $20/month, you can customize WebCEO’s tools with your brand name, logo, unique header, footer, and color schemes. To keep clients informed you can grant them read-only access WebCEO also offers a lead generation tool. This comes as a “Free SEO Audit” widget that can be embedded directly onto your website. For monthly plans starting from $99, you can run up to five express audits daily. If you opt for the Agency Unlimited plan, you can perform unlimited audits with a daily fee of $0.49/lead after the first five free audits. Its intuitive and user-friendly dashboard are designed for effortless navigation. Despite its overwhelming volume of metrics, you can customize the dashboard to show only relevant data. Pricing: Startup Plan: $99/month Agency Unlimited Plan: $99/month Corporate Plan: $299/month. WebCEO also offers a 14-day free trial. Pros and cons: ✅ Comprehensive set of SEO tools ✅ Customizable, branded, automated reporting ✅ Effective task management features ✅ White label options ✅ Lead generator for attracting new clients ❌ Additional users cost extra ❌ Agency features come as add-ons ❌ Additional costs for scanning ❌ Potentially overwhelming UI Verdict: WebCEO offers an extensive range of SEO tools for your agency. Its strong sides are its customizable reporting, task management, and white-label options. Unfortunately, the potential additional costs for scanning, extra users and tools could be drawbacks for agencies on a tight budget. 7. Mangools Mangools is a beginner-friendly SEO platform. While it may not have as many features as some of the other tools on this list, it is very easy to use and has straightforward metrics. Mangools provides a compact suite of essential SEO tools: KWFinder SERPChecker SERPWatcher LinkMiner SiteProfiler It also offers free SEO tools, including a browser extension, SERP simulator, and SERP volatility checker. Mangools only offers extra seats in its Premium plan or higher. All sub-users must share the parent account’s limits, and each additional seat can be purchased at $19/month. Its reporting features are pert of the SERPWatcher tool. It provides rudimentary keyword reports that are only accessible via a browser link. You can access the platform’s API upon request through its KWFinder and SERPChecker. Also, no external integrations are currently available other than Google Suggest. The platform’s white label features are basic and can only be found in the SERPWatcher tool. You can add a company name, website, email, logo, and colors—but that’s it. Mangools offers no additional features for agencies specifically. But future updates may address this gap. The platform is known favorably for its intuitive and easy-to-understand interface, which means you don’t have to be an SEO expert to get started. Pricing: Entry: $29.00/month Basic: $49.00/month Premium: $69.00/month Agency: $129.00/month Starting with the Premium and Agency plans, users can enjoy decent usage limits and more user seats. Pros and cons: ✅ User-friendly interface ✅ Easy to start with ✅ Affordable pricing ✅ Free learning materials ❌ Basic toolset ❌ Limited agency-specific tools ❌ Basic reporting ❌ No integrations ❌ Limited white-label capabilities Verdict: Mangools is a good choice for anyone seeking a straightforward, user-friendly, and reasonably priced SEO toolset. On the other hand, it falls short in advanced SEO tools, reporting capabilities, team management features, and API integration. 8. Moz Moz is another excellent all-in-one platform for digital marketers, SEO professionals, and agencies. The platform offers tons of SEO solutions, many of which are designed specifically to meet the diverse needs of agencies. Moz provides three solutions: Moz Local Moz Pro Stat Here are some core SEO tools included with Moz Pro: Site audits Rank tracking Backlink analysis Keyword research It also offers free tools like Domain Analysis, Keyword Explorer, Link Explorer, Competitive Research, and the Moz Bar. Moz Pro lets you share user access. These users have full access to campaigns and research tools under the shared subscription but cannot delete campaigns, manage billing, or add/remove users. Depending on the pricing plan, the number of user seats included varies from 1 to 5. You can buy extra seats at $49/month/seat. Users can generate customized reports automatically, weekly or monthly. If you have the Medium plan or higher, you can include your very own branding and logo on each report. The platform itself can’t be white-labeled. Its pricing for API access starts at $250 a month. Moz Pro also has integrations with GA4, GBP, AgencyAnalytics, WebCEO, BrightEdge, and other tools. Moz’s interface is pretty outdated. This doesn’t bode well for the overall user experience. Moz’s dashboard layout looks cluttered and requires a steeper learning curve. Pricing: Standard Plan: $99/month Medium Plan: $179/month Large Plan: $299/month Premium Plan: $599/month All of these plans can be billed annually with a 20% discount. Moz Local is separately priced, starting at $14/month. Additionally, Moz Pro offers a 30-day free trial. Pros and cons: ✅ Many different SEO tools ✅ Big database ✅ Customizable reporting ✅ Long free trial ❌ Outdated interface ❌ No white-label platform option ❌ No agency-specific features ❌ Some features and limits come with extra costs Verdict: Moz has a vast database and a wide range of tools, which are strong points. However, the platform’s outdated user interface, steep learning curve, and limited white-label features may deter some users from committing to a subscription plan. 9. WooRank WooRank is a simple SEO software for agencies, business owners, and marketing professionals that excels at providing quick and in-depth web page audits. WooRank comes packed with several essential SEO tools for your agency: Keyword Tracking Tool Competitive Analysis Tool Complete Technical Analysis Tool The platform allows agencies to perform unlimited website evaluations.

WooRank lets you create and download unlimited PDF reports. Starting from the Premium pricing plan, you can generate white-label PDF reports with customized branding and content. However, you can’t white-label the platform itself. API access is only available through its Enterprise plan. It also offers integrations with GA4, GSC, and Facebook. WooRank’s LeadGen tool is available through its Premium plan. This tool allows agencies to generate their own leads using a free SEO audit widget that can be integrated into their website. You can white-label and customize this report to fit your agency’s unique branding. The platform’s interface is refreshingly clear and uncluttered. You can easily navigate and quickly find any feature you need. Pricing: Pro Plan: $89.99/month Premium Plan: $199.99/month The Enterprise package supports team access and other advanced agency-focused features, but it is only available upon request. WooRank also offers a 3-day free trial. Pros and cons: ✅ Quick and in-depth website audits ✅ Unlimited website reviews and PDF reports ✅ LeadGen tool for client acquisition ❌ Limited feature set compared to competitors ❌ Single-user access below the Enterprise plan ❌ No automated report sending ❌ No full white-label platform Verdict: WooRank is an efficient tool for any agency in need of quick and comprehensive website audits. On the flip side, WooRank loses points for flexibility due to its lack of multi-user support in its lower-tier plans. Also, the absence of a full white-label platform may leave larger agencies wanting more. Before we move on to more tools, it’s important to note that they do not compete or replace the ones described above. Instead, they are essential solutions that complement the previous tools by providing valuable data. While Google Search Console and Google Analytics should take top priority, some worthy alternatives include Matomo Analytics, Plausible Analytics, and Bing Webmaster Tools (if your clients want to attract traffic from Bing). 10. Google Analytics Google Analytics is a free analytics platform for tracking and reporting website traffic and user behavior. It gives agencies valuable insights into traffic channels, user engagement, and conversion data. Google Analytics provides detailed website traffic reports, including pageviews, unique visitors, bounce and engagement rates, and more. But if you’re looking for a comprehensive overview of website performance and competitive research data, you’ll need third-party SEO tools like SE Ranking. GA4 supports multiple accounts for users with different access levels (account, property, or view) but it is sometimes easier to combine this data and other sources into one dashboard for visualization in tools like Looker Studio. GA4 also integrates with almost any tool. You can customize the report date range, add specific metrics, and export or share them with your team members or clients. GA4 is a new and more advanced version of Google’s analytics platform. Unlike Universal Analytics which uses a session-based data model, GA4 employs an event-based model to provide a more comprehensive view of user journeys. On July 1, 2024, GA4 will completely replace Universal Analytics, and its properties will no longer be accessible. Pricing GA4 is a free tool. There is also a paid version called Google Analytics 360 for enterprises, but its pricing isn’t publicly available. Pros and cons: ✅ Direct and accurate source of website traffic and user behavior data ✅ Event and conversion tracking data ✅ Easy basic integration with Looker Studio or 3rd party SEO tools ✅ Free to use ✅ Multiple user access ❌ More complex tool compared to Universal Analytics ❌ Data sampling ❌ Not enough data to get a comprehensive site performance overview and competitor analysis ❌ Creating separate dashboards for convenient client reporting is required ❌ Data privacy concerns in the EU Verdict: Google Analytics is a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing website traffic and user behavior. Most importantly, it’s free. While it provides accurate data and many insights into website traffic, user behavior, and conversions, it’s best to combine GA4 with other SEO tools to get a bigger picture of your website’s performance. 11. Google Search Console Google Search Console is another free Google tool for monitoring the site’s search traffic, tracking performance, identifying various SEO issues, and discovering which queries drive the most traffic. With this tool, you can analyze your clients’ website performance in Google Search results, Google Discover, and Google News. It also lets you check for indexing issues, identify external and internal links, and discover each page’s impression and click count. Since the tool doesn’t restrict user count, you can share access with all your team members and clients. GSC offers detailed reports on website search performance, pages, keywords, links, and index status and issues. You can export reports in Google Sheets or download Excel or CSV files. The tool streamlines integration with other Google services, like GA4 and others. It also offers a robust API for custom data solutions. However, it does not have White Label or agency-specific features. The interface is user-friendly and designed for accessibility, so both SEO beginners and experts will have no problem getting used to the tool. Pricing Free to use. Pros and cons: ✅ Must-use tool, offering some of the most accurate data on organic traffic from Google ✅ Direct data on indexing and crawling status ✅ Seamless integrations and API ✅ Free to use ❌ Data limitations (1,000 pages) ❌ Lack of competitive research data ❌ Need for a separate dashboard to ensure client-friendly reporting ❌ Only provides organic search data on Google Verdict: GSC should be part of every agency’s SEO toolkit. While it shouldn’t be the only solution you provide SEO services through, you can combine it with other SEO tools and platforms to establish a well-rounded SEO strategy. Conclusion When selecting the best tool for your SEO agency, consider your requirements and carefully weigh the pros and cons of every option. Assess your goals, and explore each tool’s functionalities until you find one that perfectly aligns with your aspirations. May your search for the best SEO tool for your agency be a fruitful one!
