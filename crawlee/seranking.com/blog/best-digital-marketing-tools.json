Digital marketing is a broad term that includes various branches and directions, each with its own strategies and tactics. That’s why the “best” digital marketing tool, in this sense, is the one that fits your unique needs. What works well for one company might not be the best fit for another. And the right fit depends on the kind of company you have, its size, available budget, and specific tasks. With countless apps, tools, and platforms to choose from, it’s easy to become overwhelmed or, even worse, to end up selecting something that doesn’t efficiently address your unique requirements. To solve half of the problem, narrow down your focus. There is also a ton of room for experimentation here. Take some time to play around with different tools. You’ll eventually discover the combination that ticks all the right boxes for your business. As you go through the options on this list, expect to find some that aren’t quite right. You may even discover new tools you hadn’t considered before or find a hidden gem that’s perfect for your needs! Don’t limit yourself to just one digital marketing tool forever.

Best marketing tools for general use ChatGPT & Gemini Many businesses find AI helpful in their marketing. Experts often choose ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Both can be used for various marketing initiatives, be it content creation, SEO optimization, market and industry research, ad copywriting, campaign analysis, and more. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is an AI-powered chatbot platform that can engage in human-like discussions and provide quick responses to a wide range of queries. It uses natural language processing (NLP) technology to make it feel like you’re chatting with a real human. But it’s better to think of ChatGPT as a helpful tool rather than something to depend on for important tasks. While it boasts impressive capabilities, it does have its drawbacks, including generating incorrect information, repeating certain phrases too often, and sometimes sounding a bit robotic—all of which need some fine-tuning and fact-checking. Core features: NLP for understanding and generating human-like text Deep learning algorithms for analyzing vast amounts of data Multilingual support for engaging with users from around the world Customizable models for tailoring the AI to specific marketing needs Code generation and debugging capabilities for software development Continuous learning and improvement through user interactions ChatGPT’s standout feature: It understands context and gives human-like answers. Google Gemini is an advanced new language model developed by Google. It has already been incorporated into the company’s AI tools, including SGE and Bard. It can understand and process various forms of data, including text, images, audio, and more. Thanks to its advanced coding and reasoning capabilities, it delivers accurate and useful results. Core features: Multimodal processing Integration with various Google tools and APIs Flexible models for different project sizes Improved AI-generated results with better accuracy and helpfulness Gemini’s standout feature: It processes and generates multiple media types (text, images, videos). Prices start at $20/mo (premium features and top-tier support). *Free version is available. Both tools are best for developers, writers, researchers, and anyone looking to use the power of AI for creative problem-solving, idea generation, and technical help. Another alternative language model worth trying is Perplexity AI. This language model measures its ability to predict sequences of words, resulting in clearer and more predictable text generation. Equipped with security features and a co-pilot function, Perplexity AI provides accurate and interactive communication while maintaining users’ privacy. It uses NLP and ML algorithms to ensure search results are accurate and up-to-date. Miro Miro is a visual workspace and central hub for teams to brainstorm ideas, plan projects, and communicate.
