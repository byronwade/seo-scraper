These custom connectors can work with any internet-accessible data source, from social media platforms to private company databases. You can build, test, and deploy your connector, then share it directly with colleagues or even submit it to the Looker Studio Connector Gallery for everyone to use. Also note that Google-owned connectors are easy to use but may have limited data coverage, granularity, and quotas. This can be tricky for larger businesses or ones that need more specific insights. To close these gaps, third-party tool connectors like SE Ranking offer specialized data that can be blended with primary source data for more detailed insights. For instance, SE Ranking’s keyword position data is more accurate compared to GSC’s. Additionally, SE Ranking provides metrics not offered by GSC, such as search visibility, which enhances SEO analysis depth. 4 Looker Studio connectors for core SEO tasks We define the following Looker Studio connectors as the primary sources of material for you to paint a clear picture of your SEO efforts with, specifically as they relate to your core SEO tasks.
