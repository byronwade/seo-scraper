Letâ€™s figure out why this happens. Content syndication refers to the process of distributing or sharing content (such as articles and blog posts) across multiple platforms or websites. This can involve republishing content from one source to another. The goal of content syndication is to increase the reach and visibility of the content by spreading it across different channels. Syndicating content drives traffic back to the original source. This can improve SEO because it entails generating backlinks from other sites. However, there is one problem that could prevent you from reaping the benefits of syndicated content. When publishers use cross-domain canonicalization to share syndicated content, Google may have a hard time figuring out where the original source of the content came from. Unlike canonical tags under a single domain, cross-domain canonicalization is more difficult for Googleâ€™s system to handle. Canonicalization is also designed to signal to Google which of the (nearly) identical pages is canonical. Syndicated pages, on the other hand, may vary significantly from the original content. This makes them difficult to classify as duplicates in the traditional sense. This can lead to confusion as to which version of the content should be prioritized in the SERPs. This results in the SEO authority and ranking potential of the content being attributed not to the owner but to one or more of the syndicating websites. Hi Lily! It's complicated, and not all the things you're asking about are things we necessarily even use. In general, if we recognize a page as canonical, that's going to be the page most likely rewarded by our ranking systems.â€” John (@JohnMu) January 31, 2024 So, what solution does Google recommend to address this issue? To prevent potential confusion, Google suggests that you ask your partner to block all indexation of the syndicated copies that they have possession over. I would suggest this is more \"Google may consolidate the ranking signals from a syndication partner's URL *if you haven't required them to use noindex as recommended* for people who are concerned about outranking syndication partners they voluntarily give the content to. I knowâ€¦ https://t.co/ZX0EuCCZ24â€” Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) January 31, 2024 According to Googleâ€™s guidelines, partners should add this robots meta tag to your articles: <meta name=\"Googlebot\" content=\"noindex\"> This will prevent your content on partnersâ€™ websites from ranking on SERPs and disrupting the original resource. Whether itâ€™s your own project or your partnerâ€™s site, checking the canonical settings and the presence of the noindex tag on any websiteâ€™s pages can be easy.
