  "content": "Blog / Best Marketing Tools / 10 Ahrefs Alternatives and Their Pros and Cons10 Ahrefs Alternatives and Their Pros and Cons Written by Svetlana Shchehel Reviewed by Anastasia Kotsiubynska Jun 14, 2024 27 min read Ahrefs is one of the most popular and widely-utilized SEO tools with a massive dataset of 12 billion keywords and over 500 billion indexed pages. Extensive backlink databases make Ahrefs top the list of the best SEO link building software.

SE Ranking SE Ranking is a comprehensive SEO suite designed for agency and in-house teams. It is praised for the balance between cost and functionality, but it’s not just the price tag that’s appealing. SE Ranking goes the extra mile to keep up with the latest trends by integrating AI into its tools and algorithms to further enhance data quality. Core SEO tools Keyword & Competitive Research tools Keyword Rank Tracker On-page SEO Checker Website Audit Tool Content Editor Local Marketing Module Backlink Checker and Gap Analyzer Report Builder Functionality SE Ranking will assist you with every essential SEO task: keyword rank tracking, website auditing, keyword & competitive research, backlink analysis & monitoring. Unlike Ahrefs, it provides AI-based tools like On-Page SEO Checker, SERP Analyser and AI writing assistant (which is also considered one of the best Surfer SEO alternatives). The result is users who have given SE Ranking’s product direction a 9.4 out of 10, edging out Ahrefs’ score of 9.1. SE Ranking also caters to SEO agencies’ needs with features like unlimited reporting, lead generation widget and white label (all not available in Ahrefs). The platform boasts a massive keyword database (190 countries) with traffic estimates that mirror Google Search Console data with up to 100% accuracy. SE Ranking also constantly fine-tunes its keyword search volume calculating mechanism and enhances other data processing algorithms. For instance, thanks to the recent update to the backlink database, SE Ranking can now calculate Domain Trust and Keyword Difficulty with sharper accuracy. This helps the platform prioritize more quality keyword opportunities than other tools like Ahrefs. Interface SE Ranking’s user interface is modern, straightforward, and easy to navigate. Its ease-of-use also outperforms that of Ahrefs’ both on the G2 and Capterra scoring 9.3 out of 10 and 4.8 out of 5 as opposed to Ahrefs rated of 8.9. and 4.5 respectively. User reviews SE Ranking’s collective user review score is high, with an overall rating of 4.8/5 stars from over 1,100 reviews on G2, and 4.7/5 stars from 270 reviews on Capterra. Users have applauded SE Ranking for its range of features, data accuracy, and fair pricing. Pros ✅ Comprehensive suite with 35+ SEO tools ✅ Continuously expanding databases ✅ AI-powered data processing algorithms ✅ Agency-level functionality ✅ Integrations with Google Analytics, Search Console, Looker Studio, and more ✅ Flexible pricing plans with generous limits Cons ❌ Steeper learning curve for advanced features ❌ Extra fees for advanced agency tools Price Unlike Ahrefs, SE Ranking offers a flexible pricing structure allowing businesses to scale without pushing their operational costs to the limits. Pricing starts at $65/month or $52/month (if billed annually). 2. Spyfu Launched in 2005 as a ‘spy’ tool, SpyFu has progressively evolved into a comprehensive platform for keyword research and competitor analysis for SEO and PPC specialists. It’s a budget-conscious Ahrefs alternative offering a user-friendly interface. Core SEO tools SEO Analysis & PPC Research Competitor Analysis Backlinks Builder Keyword Research Rank Tracking SERP Analysis Functionality Depending on your specific needs, SpyFu may be a good Ahrefs alternative or not quite. It stands out for its advanced competitor analysis capabilities, being particularly helpful in tracking the evolution of competitors’ strategies over time. Many users would call SpyFu a top contender when it comes to ranking the best competitor research tools. Its powerful Ad History feature provides extensive insights into a competitor’s PPC ad strategy, but if your focus is on SEO, you won’t find these features useful. While Spyfu offers basic rank-tracking and robust keyword research features, its technical and on-page optimization tools fall short. Its backlink databases are also not as extensive as those provided by Ahrefs. Interface SpyFu offers a relatively user-friendly interface that allows for seamless navigation. Its visually appealing dashboard is designed for swift and efficient access to critical data, such as SEO Research, PPC Research, Keyword Research, Backlinks, Reports, and more. Regarding ease of use, SpyFu and Ahrefs are pretty comparable. SpyFu scored 8.7 out of 10 in this category, while Ahrefs edged slightly ahead with a score of 8.8. User reviews SpyFu, while not as widely recognized as Ahrefs, is praised highly by its dedicated user base. SpyFu holds a 4.5 out of 5 star rating from over 140 reviews on Capterra. It also enjoys a 4.6 out of 5 star rating on G2, based on close to 500 reviews and 8.3 out of 10 stars from 130 reviews on TrustRadius. Pros ✅ Access to 10+ years of historical data with the Professional plan ✅ Extensive insights on competitors (both organic and paid strategies) ✅ Low price tag, which makes it a good option for startups and small businesses ✅ User-friendly interface that is easy to navigate ✅ 30-day money back guarantee Cons ❌ Limited features for technical and on-page optimization ❌ Limited data scope on organic keywords and backlinks Price Pricing starts at $39/month or $33/month (if billed annually), unlike Ahrefs’ initial plan, which is priced at $129 monthly. The Professional plan from SpyFu is available for $79/month. 3. Semrush Being one of the long-established SEO software suites, Semrush boasts a rich set of features similar to Ahrefs. Still, these tools appeal to different people: users tend to choose Ahrefs because of its excellent backlink indexing feature, whereas Semrush is mostly valued for its extensive functionality. Both Ahrefs and Semrush are appreciated for reliable datasets, though many users would still question their data accuracy. Nonetheless, Semrush has plenty of loyal advocates. Core SEO tools Keyword Research On-page SEO Competitor Analysis Content Marketing Local SEO Rank Tracking Backlink Analytics Functionality Semrush comes in handy for keyword research, website auditing, on-page SEO, competitor analysis, rank tracking and link building, but also covers local SEO, content marketing, and social media management. PPC specialists working with Google Shopping campaigns appreciate Semrush’s unique Product Listing Ads feature. Keep in mind that most of the advanced features are accessible only with higher-tier pricing plans, which forces users on a tighter budget to look for Semrush alternatives. If you do have a budget in place, and your choice of an SEO tool depends on the breadth of its feature set, Semrush blows Ahrefs out of the water. Still, some users have mentioned that Semrush’s many features can make navigation and tool discovery difficult. Interface Based on user reviews, the platform’s complex interface is often challenging to navigate. Not surprisingly, Ahrefs generally outperforms Semrush in terms of user-friendliness (8.9 vs 8.4 on G2). User reviews Semrush holds its own, with 4.6 out of 5 stars on G2, 4.4 out of 5 stars on Gartner, and an 8.9 out of 10 rating on TrustRadius. Keep in mind again that there are tons of reviews that point out its lack of user-friendliness. Pros ✅ Advanced SEO capabilities ✅ Large dataset of keywords and backlinks ✅ Powerful Social Media Toolkit ✅ Effective PPC advertising tools ✅ Bundle of extra tools like Ecommerce Booster, Prowly, and Kompyte Cons ❌ Data accuracy issues ❌ Steep learning curve for navigation ❌ Expensive pricing plans Price Semrush comes at a significant cost, and recent price hikes make it even less budget-friendly. As of now, pricing for the most affordable plan starts at $129.95/month. For more features (e.g., Looker Studio integration, the Content Marketing Toolkit, historical data, etc.), you’d have to upgrade to either the $249.95 or $499.95 monthly plan. 4. Mangools If both Ahrefs and Semrush are too complex and costly for your needs, we have an affordable alternative for you. Mangools is tailored primarily to small businesses, evidenced by its friendlier pricing structure. It also has a unique and striking design that is sure to leave a lasting impression! Core SEO tools KWFinder (Keyword research) SERPChecker (SERP analysis) SERPWatcher (Rank tracking) LinkMiner (Backlink research & analysis) SiteProfiler (SEO metrics & insights) Functionality In terms of functionality, Mangools offers essential SEO features, including keyword analysis, competitor research, backlink analysis, rank tracking, and search engine results page (SERP) analysis. At the same time, the data limits Mangools offers are quite modest—the most extensive Agency plan comes with only 1200 keyword lookups per day. Some users also called attention to Magool’s limited database, especially when compared to Ahrefs. Mangools currently does not offer tools for crawl analysis, site speed, or technical audits, which may be too restrictive for certain users looking for feature-rich Ahrefs alternatives. Interface If having a simple user interface is high on your priority list, then look no further than Mangools. It is “An excellent product featuring user-friendly tools and supportive customer service,” according to most user comments about Mangools. Users often laud it for its simplicity, ease of use, and its accessibility for beginners. Mangools stands at a remarkable 9.8 out of 10 for its ease of use. User reviews While Mangools is not as popular as Ahrefs, it doesn’t lag behind in quality. It boasts a 4.6/5 star rating on G2 and a 4.7/5 on Capterra. Its user interface and customer service elements continue to receive a good chunk of the praise from its users. Pros ✅ Five basic SEO tools in one package ✅ SEO extension for a quick website analysis ✅ Affordable pricing making it a great fit for freelancers and SEO newbies ✅ User-friendly interface with data presented in an easy-to-understand format ✅ Free learning materials (blog, tools guides, and SEOpedia with commonly used SEO terms) Cons ❌ A narrow range of SEO capabilities (e.g., lacking features for technical SEO audits, content optimization, local marketing strategies, etc.) ❌ Limited internal data with dependence on external sources (e.g., Moz, Majestic) Price Pricing for the Basic plan starts at $29/month or $19.90/month (if billed annually). Agency ($129/month) and Premium ($69/month) plans come with five and three user seats respectively, but are both not impressive in terms of feature breadth and data limits. 5. Moz Pro Moz Pro is another industry veteran and a viable alternative to Ahrefs. While Moz has powerful functionality under its belt, many SEOs claim its days of glory are gone. The interface looks outdated and new feature releases have become a rare occasion. However, with a loyal community, loads of useful educational materials, and all the core SEO tools, it still remains one of the big names in the SEO industry. Core SEO tools Keyword Research Rank Tracking Site Crawl On-Page Optimization Link Research Functionality Moz Pro offers every essential SEO tool you expect from an all-in-one suite, from keyword research and rank tracking to website audits and even custom reporting (which Ahrefs lacks). Reporting features are not commonly included in the SEO suits, so if you’re on the hunt for the best SEO report tool to keep your clients in the loop, your options are quite limited. Moz Pro’s keyword database is not that ample if you compare its size with other tools, but its backlink database (with 40.7 trillion links in its index) exceeds that of Ahrefs. But since Ahrefs crawler is the second most active crawler out there, users still prefer the backlink data Ahrefs provides. Finally, many users admit that Moz Pro’s tech auditing capabilities are rather basic and resort to other more advanced website audit tools. Interface Moz Pro’s interface is considered outdated by many users. It gives you a totally different feel if compared to the sleek interfaces of Mangools or SE Ranking. Lack of visually appealing and easy-to-read graphs is another complaint Moz Pro users tend to have. User reviews While Moz Pro has received plenty of user reviews over the years, it doesn’t top the charts compared to other top Ahrefs alternatives. On G2, it scores 4.4 out of 5 stars. On Gartner, it’s rated 4.7 out of 5 stars. TrustRadius gives it a score of 8.1 out of 10. Pros ✅ Comprehensive set of SEO tools ✅ Large database of keywords, indexed links, and analyzed SERPs ✅ AI-powered search intent analysis and domain overview ✅ Extensive 30-day free trial ✅ MozBar SEO Chrome extension Cons ❌ Outdated interface & complex navigation structure ❌ Generous data limits come at an additional cost Price Pricing starts at $99/month or $79/month (if billed annually). It’s worth noting that Moz Pro only offers weekly ranking updates, and there isn’t even an option to get daily updates at an extra cost. 6. SEO PowerSuite SEO PowerSuite is an extensive SEO software often featured in the lists of Ahrefs competitors. This popular tool is acclaimed for its ability to automate, personalize, and generate SEO reports. Therefore, this software is worth considering if you’re seeking Ahrefs alternatives due to comprehensive report customization needs. Core SEO tools Rank Tracker (rank tracking & keyword research) WebSite SEO Spider (technical & on-page SEO audit) SEO SpyGlass (backlink profile analysis) LinkAssistant (link building & management) Functionality With four applications, SEO PowerSuite covers all the basic SEO needs: Rank Tracker is designed for keyword tracking and analysis, WebSite Auditor for technical and on-page optimization, SEO SpyGlass for investigating backlink opportunities, and LinkAssistant for planning link prospecting and outreach. A feature that sets it apart from Ahrefs is the provision of personalized white-labeling, potentially making it more appealing to SEO agency users. Additionally, it provides a Content Management Dashboard and Google Analytics Integration, features not present in Ahrefs. It’s worth noting that unlike the majority of modern SEO tools, SEO PowerSuite is not cloud-based and is only available for Windows users. Interface Based on user feedback, maneuvering through this SEO tool can be challenging. Despite being robust and comprehensive, it necessitates the installation of four separate applications on your computer. Users highlight the tool’s steep learning curve and note that its user interface is less intuitive or user-friendly than other market competitors like Ahrefs. User reviews While being a dependable tool, it still ranks among the lesser-rated options on our list of Ahrefs alternatives. With ratings of 4.3 out of 5 on Capterra, 8.8 out of 10 on TrustRadius, and 4.5 out of 5 on G2, SEO PowerSuite’s aggregate score based on reviews is relatively consistent. Pros ✅ Suite of four comprehensive SEO tools ✅ No daily credit limit for SEO data (keywords, backlinks, etc.) ✅ Integrations with Google Search Console, Analytics, and Keyword Planner ✅ Custom, white-label, automated SEO reporting ✅ Free forever plan with a basic set of features Cons ❌ Limited functionality for in-depth analysis and optimization ❌ The lack of payment flexibility (no monthly payment option) ❌ Desktop software only (no cloud-based accessibility) Price Pricing starts at $299/year for the Professional pricing plan and $499/year for the Enterprise plan. This seems a relatively high price for an SEO tool not available in the cloud. 7. Raven Tools Raven Tools, despite being underrated, is a complex SEO and reporting tool that offers integrated solutions for managing your digital marketing and advertising data. Core SEO tools Site Auditor SERP Rank Tracker Keyword Rank Checker Competitor Analysis Keyword Research Backlink Checker Link Spy Tool Social Media Management Functionality Just like Ahrefs, Raven Tools has all the essential features to build an effective SEO strategy, including competitor research, website auditing, rank tracking, backlink tracking, keyword research, and social media reporting. It also offers more than 20 integrations with platforms such as Google Search Console, Google Analytics, and Google/Bing/Facebook ads. This gives it a competitive edge against dozens of tools like Ahrefs and makes it a strong SpyFu, Mangools, and Moz alternative. Nonetheless, some users have encountered technical issues with third-party software connections, often reporting that they have to make frequent contact with technical support to resolve backend errors. Interface Raven Tools has received mixed feedback for its user interface. Some users find it overly complex and time-consuming. There are even reports of Raven Tools lacking fundamental data, particularly from Google Ads. Some Raven Tools also report technical issues, suggesting a potentially difficult user experience. This has contributed to the tool’s lower ease-of-use rating in comparison to Ahrefs (8.4 vs. 8.9 out of 10 points). User reviews Raven Tools stands its ground with good ratings, sporting 4.4 out of 5 stars on Capterra, 4.2 on G2, and 4.5 on Gartner. On TrustRadius, its rating is somewhat lower, with a score of 7.7 out of 10. The lowest ratings of Raven Tools can be attributed to its lack of user-friendliness and the current direction of its development. It’s important to consider that Raven Tools doesn’t have as many total reviews as Ahrefs, so a making direct comparison may not provide a complete picture. Pros ✅ A wide range of SEO tools—all bundled into a single platform ✅ Integrations with 20+ platforms like Google Analytics, Search Console, Google Ads, Bing Ads, and more ✅ Comprehensive white-label reports for SEO and marketing ✅ Social media management & reporting for Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn ✅ Affordable pricing plans that start with a free trial Cons ❌ Fewer advanced SEO features compared to other Ahrefs competitors ❌ Occasional technical issues with third-party software connections Price Pricing starts at $49/month or $39/month (if billed annually). Yet, users have given Raven Tools a lower rating for its value for money. This is important to note if you plan on selecting this tool instead of other Ahrefs alternatives. 8. Seobility Seobility is an entry-level SEO toolkit designed to enhance website rankings. While the tool’s feature set is more basic compared to industry leaders like Ahrefs, its user-friendly interface is perfect for novices in SEO. Core SEO tools Website Audit Tool Rank Tracker Backlink Analysis Tools Keyword Research Tool TF*IDF Tool Functionality Although not as popular as Ahrefs, Seobility still offers essential SEO features including on-page SEO audits, backlink analysis, link-building tools, and rank tracking. It also provides additional tools like the TF*IDF tool to enhance SEO content creation and optimization. One notable feature is its comprehensive on-page SEO audit function. It meticulously scans all linked website pages, identifying and displaying optimization issues or errors. Despite its wide set of offerings, some beginner users have reported that the tool’s reports occasionally lack detailed explanations. This can make it challenging for users, particularly those seeking action-oriented Ahrefs alternatives, to comprehend and address the identified errors. Interface While viewpoints on Seobility’s user interface vary, its ease-of-use score is notably high (9.1 out of 10 on G2), surpassing Ahrefs’ score at 8.9. Users regard the platform highly for its simplicity, although some say its aesthetics are pretty outdated. Users also criticize the Seobility for its inconvenient navigation, as users must go from page to page to create a comprehensive to-do list. User reviews Despite its lower profile and fewer reviews compared to Ahrefs, Seobility has earned positive feedback from its users. It has performed well with an average score of 4.6 out of 5 stars on G2 and 4.7 out of 5 stars on Capterra. One user hailed it as “A great service that delivers everything you’d anticipate from an SEO analysis, and a few unexpected features as well.” Pros ✅ Powerful yet simple set of SEO tools ✅ Comprehensive on-page optimization and technical SEO analysis ✅ TF*IDF functionality ✅ Free plan to test out the software before upgrading Cons ❌ Less in-depth data and advanced filtering options compared to competitors ❌ Outdated design & inconvenient navigation Price Pricing for the Premium plan (designed for small to mid-sized businesses) starts at $50/month or $40/month (if billed annually). The Agency plan, which caters to large websites, companies, and agencies, is priced at $200. These prices make Seobility a much more affordable option compared to Ahrefs. 9. cognitiveSEO сognitiveSEO is a lesser-known but excellent Ahrefs alternative that stands at the higher end of the pricing scale. This comprehensive digital marketing strategy tool offers a wide range of SEO functionalities and excels in its capabilities for team collaboration and project management. Core SEO tools Content Optimization Tool Site Audit Tool Backlink Analysis Tool Penalty Recovery Tool Rank Tracker Site Explorer Functionality With features for on-page SEO analysis, content optimization, tech site auditing, backlink analysis, rank tracking, shareable SEO dashboards, marketing reports, and API, cognitiveSEO caters to a variety of digital marketing needs. Its penalty recovery feature may seem unique at first glance, but in fact, all it does is unnatural link detection, which many different tools similar to Ahrefs offer. The tool is focused solely on the decade-old Penguin algorithm. cognitiveSEO offers a collaborative workspace for different teams, making it easy to share assets, files, or even code snippets with developers. Results can be shared via scheduled customized PDF reports and, on top of that, the entire toolset can be white labeled. cognitiveSEO offers rather unique integrations with Trello and Google Drive to streamline team discussions and foster a collaborative work environment. Interface CognitiveSEO is rated 8.1 out of 10 by users for its ease of use, which puts it slightly behind Ahrefs. User reviews suggest that cognitiveSEO’s interface may not be the most intuitive and its performance could be improved. Its keyword research tool is especially lacking in this area. User reviews cognitiveSEO didn’t earn the same level of recognition as Semrush or Ahrefs, but has a solid reputation backed by favorable user reviews. It has received a rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars on G2 and 8 out of 10 stars on TrustRadius. The most common drawbacks cognitiveSEO users mention are the tool’s complex interface and frequent technical problems. On the other hand, they praise cognitiveSEO’s top-notch customer support. Pros ✅ A comprehensive suite of SEO features ✅ Free SEO tools like Site Explorer, Keyword Tool, and Google Algorithm Changes ✅ Google Analytics integration for tracking website traffic and user behavior ✅ White-labeling features for Premium and Elite pricing plans ✅ Scheduled customized PDF reports Cons ❌ Lack of some of the advanced features offered by other SEO tools ❌ A little old-school and clunky interface Price Pricing starts at $129.99/month or $89/month (if billed annually). Due to its high price and complexity, CognitiveSEO is more suitable for agencies and larger enterprises, as opposed to smaller businesses or solo entrepreneurs. 10. Ubersuggest Created by Neil Patel as a basic keyword research, Ubersuggest has over the years transformed into a full-fledged SEO platform. Ubersuggest cannot compete with Ahrefs when it comes to advanced features or database sizes. Still, thanks to the user-friendly interface combined with an extensive training and support package, it is one the best Ahrefs alternatives to date for SEO novices. Core SEO tools Keyword Research Technical SEO Audit Competitor Analysis Rank Tracking Backlink Monitoring Functionality Ubersuggest is equipped with basic SEO features, including technical SEO auditing, rank tracking, link building, competitor analysis, and custom report generation. The comprehensive keyword research tool remains Ubersuggest’s core function, offering keyword recommendations and content insights that are on par with the other tools on our Ahrefs alternatives list. Ubersuggest offers numerous step-by-step SEO tutorials, templates, and worksheets, which add extra value for beginners. Interface If ease of use is your primary consideration when choosing an SEO tool, then Ubersuggest is a top contender. Ubersuggest stands out for its user-friendly interface, effectively simplifying and distilling complex information, unlike Ahrefs which can have a steeper learning curve. Ubersuggest features a minimalist aesthetic combined with a straightforward and easily navigable layout, offering a wealth of information. The dashboard immediately offers optimization suggestions for your site, enhancing the overall user experience. User reviews Ubersuggest has received slightly lower user ratings compared to the other tools we listed as the best Ahrefs alternatives. It has achieved a rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars on G2, 3.6 out of 5 stars on Trustpilot, and 8.2 out of 10 stars on TrustRadius. Interestingly, the slightly lower ratings seem to be less connected to the tool’s functionality or user interface and more connected to issues encountered in the billing process. Pros ✅ Variety of key SEO tools ✅ Free plan with basic features ✅ Affordable paid plans ✅ Free Chrome extension ✅ User-friendly interface and clear data visualizations Cons ❌ Not as technical and in-depth as other SEO tools ❌ Limited keyword data ❌ Lack of integrations Price Pricing for monthly plans starts at $12. Lifetime deals start at $120 per 1 website. Despite these obvious perks of pricing options, prospective buyers should still exercise caution before making a purchase. Some users have voiced concerns regarding payment issues, particularly instances where they were erroneously charged for a lifetime plan when they intended to opt for a monthly subscription. Why would people seek Ahrefs alternatives? Ahrefs has maintained a loyal user base over the years, but the jury is still out whether these users are truly satisfied with the tool. Though many reviews suggest that a significant number of people continue to pay a premium price for Ahrefs, this is namely because users have grown accustomed to its interface. And what shortcomings are we referring to here? Well, we’ve highlighted the most frequently mentioned issues reported by users of this tool. Cost: As we touched upon earlier, Ahrefs isn’t cheap. Its prices start at $129 for a basic Lite package with limited features. Pay attention to the word ‘start.’ Folks behind Ahrefs stress that the “baseline price doesn’t include additional charges that may pop up if you go over your plan’s limits.” This pricing model can be a hurdle for small to medium-sized businesses as well as agencies. Some have even voiced that the total bill can hit a whopping $8,000 per year with an annual subscription and extra monthly fees. Ahrefs’ most expensive plan (Enterprise) will cost you even more at $14,990 per year (with an annual contract only). You’ll also have to consider extra fees for every additional user, daily ranking checks and hundreds of dollars for every additional credit. It’s no wonder Ahrefs pricing leads people to explore other options in the market. Frequent price hikes: Even if you’re okay with the current price tag on Ahrefs, you’ll need to stay on your toes. Users have grumbled about regular price increases, which bumps up the entry point for this tool and might have you hunting for alternatives sooner than you think. Limited features: Ahrefs does a great job with general SEO, but it’s missing some of the bells and whistles that can be found in its rivals. For example, it doesn’t offer a specialized tool for local SEO pros, leaving users to dig up info from other sources. Unlike its more cutting-edge competitors, Ahrefs is also lagging behind in terms of its on-page optimization and content creation tools. Reports for clients: If you represent an SEO agency and you need a tool that dishes out in-depth, tailor-made reports, Ahrefs may not be the best choice. As it stands, Ahrefs does not provide this feature. Its pricing page does indicate however that a report sharing option will be available soon, starting from the Standard package and upwards. When considering these points collectively, it may serve you well to join the many users who are eyeing Ahrefs alternatives, ones that better suit their specific needs and budget. Summary The ten alternatives to Ahrefs we hand-picked for this review all offer a similar set of standard SEO tools everyone uses daily, but they all boast some unique features and vary in terms of the user experience you get. If you need a premium SEO solution, but don’t want to deal with Ahrefs’ tricky power user pricing system and strive for a more predictable monthly budget for SEO tools, you have several options. Do you have a budget to pay extra for a recognized tool that goes beyond SEO functionality? Then, consider switching to Semrush. If you’re mainly focused on SEO and manage multiple client projects, SE Ranking may be a smarter choice that won’t put that much strain on your budget. SEO newbies looking for affordable Ahrefs alternatives that are easy to navigate should consider Ubersuggest and Mangools. As it normally goes in SEO, it depends. Your optimum choice depends on your specific needs, expertise, and budget. SEO Tools 2750 views Written by Svetlana Shchehel Svetlana is the Head of Content at SE Ranking.
