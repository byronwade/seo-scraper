A data visualization dashboard is a visual interface that provides an interactive way to present and report on data. Often, when used in business sectors like digital marketing or organic marketing, data visualization dashboards are used for real-time reporting. They combine multiple data sources to create a visually compelling, and action-oriented performance point-of-view. Typically, data visualization dashboards are designed to enhance the comprehension of data by enabling a quicker discovery of patterns, performance drops or increases, or other data analyses. This can be achieved by using some or all of the following visual elements strategically: charts and graphs, titles, text and commentary, and a color palette. However, what can often elevate a dashboard from non-useful to inseparable to a team’s processes is the presence of non-tangible aspects of the design. This could include its purpose, layout, and incorporated data storytelling. Data sources for data visualization dashboards in SEO Data sources in the context of a data visualization dashboard are sources of information that the dashboard pulls from in order to organize the data into specified visualizations. Let’s go over some data sources that are typical fоr Looker Studio data visualization dashboards in SEO. Later on, we’ll discuss how to decide which ones to add to your dashboard. Data source types within Looker Studio (with benefits and limitations) The primary source types are Google-owned Looker Studio connectors like Google Analytics (for GA4), Google Sheets, Search Console, Google Ads, and Big Query, among many others. Analysts choose primary sources due to their direct data access to Google-owned data and ease of use. Some limitations of these sources include limited data coverage and granularity, plus some of the quotas implemented by the more popular connectors (e.g. Google Analytics, Search Console). These can hinder insight extraction for large companies or businesses with very specific needs. Third-party sources (or what are referred to in Looker Studio as ‘Partner Connectors’) are connectors that are released by third parties. In this category, you will find connectors from popular tools and platforms like SE Ranking, Semrush, and Ahrefs, but also connectors from technical SEO reporting tools like Sitebulb or Oncrawl. These sources often provide specialized data that can easily be blended with primary source data to generate more specific insights. There are some limitations, such as associated costs and reliance on third parties, which can sometimes result in data freshness issues or extra costs when maintaining or updating the dashboard. How to choose which sources to add to your data visualization dashboard The quality and consistency of the data sources directly impacts the quality of the visualizations produced. At the end of the day, the age-old saying in data analytics is always prevalent: data in = data out. Consider which data sources to add before designing a dashboard and ensure they align with the specific needs and goals of the project’s reporting. Here are some factors to evaluate when making your decision: The metrics you want to track: What is most important to you? Is it website traffic, keyword rankings, social media engagement, or something else? The data sources you have access to: What data sources are free, and what data sources are paid? The level of detail you need: Do you need real-time data, or is historical data sufficient? Your technical expertise: Some data sources are easier to use than others. 7 examples of data visualization dashboards for SEOs (with Looker Studio templates) Position overview and rank tracking Looker Studio dashboard Position overview and rank tracking are integral features for understanding a website’s search engine performance. They provide insights into how well various keywords perform, promote informed SEO strategies and keep websites competitive.
