Their knowledge and experience directly impact the content’s quality. SEO-related topics covered: We prioritized podcasts that either cover a wide range of SEO-related topics or dive deep into specific areas of SEO. Are you looking to learn about technical SEO, content marketing, link building, local SEO, or other facets of SEO? The best podcast should dig deep into your area of interest and offer practical strategies and reliable SEO tips. Frequency and average episode time: We considered how often new episodes are released and their average length. Shorter episodes released weekly might be ideal for those with busy schedules. In contrast, deeper dives released bi-weekly can offer more detail without the overwhelm. Podcast listeners: Is the podcast targeted at beginners, advanced SEOs, or a specific niche within the field? We picked podcasts that cover all of those needs. Availability on different platforms: The podcast should be available on your preferred platform and you should easily access it, whether it’s Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube, Google Podcasts, etc. Now, let’s dive a little deeper.
