The biggest reason to use marketing automation tools is the efficiency they add to your regular workflows. Staying competitive is next to impossible without them. Marketing tools used purely for automation can save you and your team hundreds of hours. They can make workflows smoother, help with collaboration between different departments, and improve both your marketing efforts and overall optimization. Marketing tools used for analytics provide even more value. They can help you better understand each part of your workflow, from inefficiencies in your marketing campaigns to customer journeys. This helps you optimize marketing campaigns and move business goals forward. What does the best marketing automation tool look like? There is no one-size-fits-all automation tool for marketing. Every business is different. Your choice of marketing tools will vary greatly depending on your specific marketing strategies and reporting and data analytics needs. Here are some general guidelines to follow to find the right toolset for you. Accurate data management. Some poorly coded tools can present inaccurate data or miss data during imports and exports. This is definitely not something you want to see in your tool of choice. No coding. The best marketing automation tools do not require coding. The ideal option is to have a drag-and-drop tool to create email HTMLs and automate workflows. Having the added option to work with the tool’s API is great for advanced automation down the road. Native integrations. Technically, you can integrate any tool with a third-party platform like Zapier and combine that with some coding, but this isn’t ideal. It’s best to simply add your credentials and integrate apps seamlessly. Prioritize looking for a tool that integrates with your existing toolset natively. Good support. Not everything goes according to plan, so having dedicated and quick support goes a long way. Fit for your purpose and scalable. The best marketing automation software has all the features you need. It should also be flexible and scale in the future. All the tools on our list, except for the last one, meet these criteria. You will have to determine on your own if the final tool on this list meets your needs. Now, let’s get started with our list!
