These tools play a vital role in researching topics, auditing your content, and finding effective keywords for creating or optimizing content. They are especially valuable for agencies that manage content-related SEO processes at scale. One such tool is Surfer SEO, which analyzes top-ranking content and provides insights into creating competitive content. However, some users are unimpressed by Surfer SEO’s pricing, steep learning curve, and lack of advanced features. In this article, we’ll review the top alternatives to Surfer SEO and how they stack up against it. We want to hear from you!

We took five key areas into account when assessing different options, including: Functionality: What features does the tool offer? Does it cover the same core tasks as Surfer? Interface: How easy is it to use? User reviews: We referred to G2 for insights from users. Flexibility of pricing policy: Does the cost align with the features that the tool offers? We considered factors such as value for money, scalability, and the availability of free trials or demos. Agency-specific features: How suitable is each tool for agencies? Does it offer integration capabilities with other services and additional features for SEO agencies? We also considered the target audience for these tools, whether it is freelancers, small agencies, or enterprise companies. From there, we examined the developmental trajectory of the products and looked for evidence of ongoing support and improvement. 10 Best Surfer SEO alternatives that deserve a try We carefully reviewed numerous Surfer SEO competitors and handpicked the ones we believe are the top contenders.

SE Ranking Functionality SE Ranking is one of the best Surfer SEO alternatives, providing a comprehensive approach to optimizing your website. With the Content Editor, you can create optimized SEO briefs that meet the quality standards to rank well. It does this by drawing insights from the main content parameters of top-ranking pages such as the number of words, images, headlines, page structure, and so on. It also provides actionable recommendations on keyword usage, density, and distribution based on NLP algorithms. But here’s the best part: You don’t have to use it just for creating new content! The Content Editor also helps you optimize your existing content. It identifies areas for improvement and offers clear steps to strengthen your content’s SEO, allowing you to compete head-to-head with the competition. Where SE Ranking content marketing suite excels beyond Surfer SEO is its inclusiveness. Included in this suite is an AI writer that takes into account your target keywords and tone of voice. You can use the AI writer to generate specific content types (e.g., paragraphs, meta tags, FAQs, etc) from scratch, get guidance from the AI Writer Wizard to create texts step-by-step, or even generate entire articles in one click, each with a relevant and optimized structure. If you need revisions, simply ask the AI to rewrite sections, expand on ideas, or enter any specific query for on-the-fly edits, additions, and shortcuts. The suite also features readability, grammar, punctuation, plagiarism, and typo checkers to help you finalize your piece and meet quality standards. To ensure your content hits the mark for relevance, quality, and competitiveness, you can rely on the Content Score metric. This metric evaluates your content by comparing it with top-performing pages, giving you a clear indication of how well-optimized it is. You have the flexibility to work on your content piece independently or share your brief with a freelance copywriter by providing a guest link to the tool or using the dedicated add-on for Google Docs. SE Ranking also provides keyword and competitive research, backlink gap analysis, an on-page optimization tool, and a rank tracker, among many other essential SEO tools. This means you can easily create content, optimize it if needed, and track its performance in search engines, all within a single platform. You can also track detailed article analytics and performance over time directly within the Content Editor. Due to the platform’s comprehensiveness, SE Ranking is a strong competitor to giants like Semrush or Moz and is one of the best alternatives to Ahrefs. Interface Because SE Ranking’s users span from small to mid-sized agencies and large businesses, ease of use is one of its strong points. The interface is intuitive, simple to navigate, and easy on the eyes. SE Ranking’s biggest strength is that it has various configurations and customization panels, all essential for creating content based on your needs and goals. Furthermore, transparency is a strong point. With this tool, you can gain a better understanding not only of what the tool is telling you but also of the methodology it used to determine that. User reviews With 1,314 reviews on G2 and 4.8 out of 5 stars overall, SE Ranking has a much more widespread user base than Surfer. And, in fact, many users state that they can’t find anything they don’t like about this alternative. Price Plans range from $65 per month for the Essential plan and go all the way up to $599 per month for the most ample Business plan, which includes all the SEO tools mentioned in this review on top of loads of other SEO features. You can also get a 20% discount if you purchase an annual subscription. The Content Marketing tool is sold separately as an add-on. It’s available in three formats: $29 for 15 articles: 25k AI-generated words and three plagiarism checks. $49 for 30 articles: 50k AI words, and five plagiarism checks. $99 for 120 articles: as many as 250k AI words and 10 plagiarism checks. Since the basic SE Ranking subscription is required, your entry price would be $94 ($65 + $29). For 30 articles, you’ll need to pay at least $114, and for 120 articles, it would be at least $164. Either way, this makes SE Ranking a more cost-efficient solution than Surfer, which would charge you $260 for 25 articles. Worthy of note is that SE Ranking’s Pro and Business subscriptions offer limited content creation functionalities at no extra cost. This allows you to test the Content Marketing add-on before committing to it. SE Ranking offers a 14-day free trial that includes all SEO features along with the Content Marketing module, allowing you to try everything before you buy it. Pros✅ Part of a full-featured SEO platform Comprehensive SERP-based SEO content optimization, AI-powered content generation, and analytics tracking features Intuitive, user-friendly interface with various customization options An in-built Content Score metric More affordable and provides more extensive limits compared to similar SEO content tools 14-day free trial available Well-suited for agency use Cons❌ A separate add-on purchase in addition to the basic SEO subscription. Verdict SE Ranking is a great Surfer alternative that streamlines the entire content creation process. With its SERP-based brief creation, AI-powered content generation, in-depth content optimization suggestions, and affordable pricing, it enables agencies and businesses to create SEO-optimized content at scale without breaking the bank or compromising on quality. Agencies can essentially kill two birds with one stone by purchasing the Agency Pack add-on in addition to the platform’s content marketing tools. This convenient tool combo can greatly enhance your SEO and content marketing capabilities. 2. Clearscope Functionality Clearscope offers a range of core features. You can build content briefs and SEO outlines, gain insight into what’s helping other pages rank well, and then incorporate those elements into your own content. By entering the target keyword or search intent, selecting your domain, and choosing the language, you can create and organize reports. Clearscope uses natural language processing to help you create content that outranks your competitors. While Clearscope is a popular choice for SMBs, it might actually provide far more to solopreneurs than they require. Interface It doesn’t seem to have a ton of bells and whistles. This is about as simple and concise a user interface gets. Just enter a high-level topic into the Keyword Discovery tool to find new keywords based on the most common auto-completed queries in Google. Optimize your content in the text editor by adding suggested keywords at appropriate densities. You can also create and organize your reports within the interface. User reviews Clearscope has an overall rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars on G2, based on 90 reviews. Feedback often revolves around pricing, which is considered more appropriate for bigger companies rather than solopreneurs or small businesses. There are also questions about the keyword feature, such as how the keywords are picked and the ease of changing them. Some users have even noted that the niche keywords are not closely related to the main keywords. The tool lacks a certain level of transparency, which makes it hard to obtain in-depth info. The website isn’t very comprehensive and doesn’t even talk about its tools in much detail. There are no explanations for its various features, and none of the pricing plans are thoroughly explained either. If you want more information, you’ll have to email them and ask. Price Clearscope is one of the pricier platforms on this list. Its most basic plan is $189 a month, which provides you with unlimited users, 20 content reports, 100 content inventory pages, support for five languages, and integrations for both WordPress and Google Docs. Its more robust Business plan is available for $399 a month, and its Enterprise plan is available with custom pricing. All that being said, Clearscope doesn’t appear to provide as much bang for your buck as some of the other competitors on this list. Pros✅ User-friendly interface Quick keyword discovery and NLP-based content optimization WordPress and Google Docs integration Multi-language support Unlimited users on all plans Cons❌ Expensive, especially for smaller businesses Keyword feature can be inconsistent for niche topics Lack of transparency in feature explanations Limited customization options Verdict Clearscope is a solid alternative to Surfer SEO. It offers unlimited users, multi-language support, and a simple interface that’s great for team collaboration. However, it isn’t as great for agencies compared to other Surfer SEO competitors because it lacks extensive agency-specific features. The high price and lack of transparency in feature explanations are also cause for concern. The cost might also make solopreneurs and smaller teams think twice before purchasing. These factors make other SEO content tools a more attractive option for professional SEO agencies seeking comprehensive, agency-focused tools with better value for money. 3. Frase Functionality Frase combines the beauty of SEO and AI to guide you in creating content that ranks well across all four stages of the process: researching, outlining, writing, and optimizing. It offers various features to analyze your competitors’ content, providing insights into important SERP metrics from your competitors such as word count, domain rating, and heading count. With Frase, you can generate a comprehensive content brief in a matter of seconds and identify the keywords that matter, as well as determine how many times you should be using them in your content. You can even organize your SEO outlines with Frase’s drag-and-drop feature, which allows you to quickly add headings that your competitors are using. Leveraging its AI features can be useful for fueling creativity and expanding on heading ideas. Frase’s AI Writer goes beyond Surfer SEO by incorporating background research from other sources. It analyzes your search competitors to help you effectively outline and optimize your content. Additionally, it allows for collaboration if you want to work alongside your freelancers or coworkers. Interface Frase prides itself on being intuitive. When starting a new document, you simply select the target keyword, country, and language. Frase will analyze the top 20 results with AI, summarize them, and then give you tons of insights on why those pages are ranking well and how you can compete. The document is dynamic, updating in real time as you make changes. Frase offers a puzzle-like experience, letting you pick and choose the parts of competitors that you like, and then gives you the opportunity to use them to build your own unique content. User reviews On G2, Frase has 285 reviews and an overall 4.8-star rating. Users praise it for its functionality, features, and content quality. However, some users note that there have been frequent changes to the UI. Also, some users mention that Frase’s platform is not mobile-optimized, lacks easy integration with other tools, and that the keyword search functionality leaves much to be desired. You can check our curated list and pick your best keyword research tool to use alongside Frase or pay attention to other alternatives to Surfer SEO with stronger keyword analysis capabilities. Price This platform is more affordable than many Surfer SEO alternatives. It provides a free plan with one user and one article available for optimization. Its Solo plan starts at $15 a month, providing one user seat and generating 20,000 AI words per month (240,000 words per year). However, this plan only lets you write and optimize up to 10 articles per month, or 120 articles a year. If 10 articles per month is not enough for you, you can upgrade to the next plan (which includes unlimited AI words) for $45 per month. To unlock unlimited AI writing capabilities and access basic keyword stats like search volume, domain authority, and backlink data, you can add the Pro add-on worth $35/month. Nonetheless, Frase has attractive pricing options no matter what size your business is. Pros✅ All-in-one content creation tool (research, outlining, writing, content optimization) AI-powered brief generation and competitor analysis Intuitive, real-time interface Affordable pricing Collaborative features Cons❌ No mobile optimization Limited integrations Weak keyword search functionality Article limits on lower-tier plans Verdict Frase offers a solid, AI-powered content creation solution at an accessible price point. Frase’s affordability, collaboration features, and agency-specific Pro add-on make it perfect for small and medium in-house teams and agencies. On the other hand, larger agencies with unique needs might find it lacking in advanced SEO features and integrations. Consider Frase if you’re looking to optimize your content workflow without breaking the bank, but make sure to weigh its capabilities against your specific needs to ensure it’s the right fit for you. 4. MarketMuse Functionality MarketMuse offers a range of compelling features. With its Competitive Content Analysis tool, you can gain insights into your competitors’ successful tactics and find ways to keep up with them. MarketMuse is also useful for discovering the optimal number of images to use, which H2s would work best in your favor, the hyperlinks you need, and which keywords are most important. Use topic “clusters” to dominate the SERPs and gain valuable real estate within your niche. You can also research keywords by cluster and get a personalized score that demonstrates how difficult it would be to get your site to rank for that term. MarketMuse takes the guesswork out of content planning and helps you build a high-impact content strategy in minutes. It offers a good scope of features for solopreneurs, SMBs, and large organizations. One notable feature of MarketMuse offers is its integration of ChatGPT. Most tools on this list have AI writing capabilities, and they all rely on the GPT model for natural language processing, but MarketMuse offers an actual integration with the chat. This can be more convenient for users who already use ChatGPT in their content workflow. User interface The user interface of this Surfer SEO alternative certainly appears to be less intuitive and user-friendly. It requires an investment of time and money — you likely won’t pick it up overnight and need to be patient. It doesn’t automatically save the work you do, so be prepared to have to re-enter certain information. The keyword tool also takes some trial and error to figure out. Reviews With 214 reviews, MarketMuse has an overall score of 4.6 out of 5 stars on G2. However, there seem to be a lot of complaints, first and foremost, about the price. Some users even say that you don’t get as much bang for your back as you used to, and you have to pay for some features that used to be included free of charge. The keyword research tool is also unreliable, and many reviews state that the learning curve is quite steep. Price One unique aspect of MarketMuse is its free plan, which other popular Surfer SEO alternatives (and Surfer SEO itself) do not offer. However, your page-level insights will be limited and you only get 10 queries per month (or 120 per year). This is where things get shaky, as the first paid plan already jumps to $149 a month. For this price, you get full page-level insights, one user, and 100 queries per month (or 1,200 queries per year). MarketMuse recommends this subscription for individual users. If you’re an agency, the company recommends its Team plan, which costs $399 per month. MarketMuse’s website doesn’t offer much detail regarding what you get for these prices, but it seems to be more expensive than Surfer SEO while having fewer bells and whistles. Pros✅ Comprehensive competitive content analysis Topic cluster approach for SERP domination Personalized keyword difficulty scoring ChatGPT, WordPress, and Google Docs integration Free plan available Cons❌ Less intuitive user interface with a steep learning curve Doesn’t auto-save work Expensive paid plans Keyword tool isn’t always reliable Verdict Compared to Surfer SEO, MarketMuse’s functionality is more robust, but it is also more complex to master and costly. Its in-depth content strategy features and ChatGPT integration are standout offerings. It is worth testing the platform through its free plan, but be prepared for a jump in price if you want the full package. Overall, while great for in-depth content planning, MarketMuse may not fully meet professional SEO agencies’ needs. Its steep learning curve, high costs, and lack of agency-specific features could be dealbreakers. 5. Content Harmony Functionality Content Harmony claims that they can turn two hours of work into 20 minutes within one week. The tool, which is built by an entire content marketing agency, streamlines the entire research process, from keyword research to content brief creation and content grading. It all starts with your keyword report. Content Harmony will gather hundreds of data points to give you a robust SERP analysis of your competitors. From there, build your brief and share it with your teammates and clients to see how your content scores. User interface While the UI is generally user-friendly, some users find it to be clunky and slow, particularly when using the content editor to draft content. In fact, some user reviews say that they don’t use this feature at all and instead paste in their completed draft for Content Harmony to grade. However, these nuisances appear to be small in the grand scheme of things. Reviews This Surfer SEO alternative doesn’t seem to have as big of a following as its competitor. It only has 20 reviews on G2, but it does hold strong with 4.9 out of 5 stars. The reviews are so positive, in fact, that many of the “dislikes” people mention are more (in their own words) suggestions or recommendations. Pricing Content Harmony’s pricing is on a sliding scale based on how much content you publish per month. For example, if you publish five pieces per month, they’ll charge you $50. For 25 pieces, it’s $199 per month. Notably, all plans offer unlimited users, unlimited projects, rollover credits valid for 90 days (a feature Surfer SEO doesn’t have!), and free team training. You can start with a trial priced at $10, which gets you 10 credits. The trial has no time limit, and you won’t be automatically billed until you choose to officially sign up. Pros✅ Efficient keyword research and brief creation process Comprehensive SERP analysis All plans offer unlimited users and projects 90-day rollover credits Flexible, volume-based pricing Cons❌ Suboptimal Content Editor functionality Small user base may be a consideration factor for many Verdict Content Harmony offers strong keyword research and brief creation capabilities, potentially outperforming Surfer SEO in these areas. Its flexible pricing, rollover credits, and unlimited user seats are also appealing. However, its weaker Content Editor and lack of real-time optimization features limit its usefulness as an all-in-one solution for agencies. Despite being created by an agency, it doesn’t offer many agency-specific features that could set it apart from competitors. 6. Scalenut Functionality Scalenut’s power lies in its ability to automate everything from SEO planning and research to content optimization, creation, and publishing. From first glance, you can see that this is a solid alternative to Surfer SEO, as it covers well beyond the basics. It offers AI-powered content creation, NLP-powered topic research, keyword research, SEO optimization features, and various AI capabilities. The star of the show? Cruise Mode. This feature can generate 1500+ word articles in 5 minutes. Scalenut can also perform keyword research, create outlines, and even generates meta descriptions. Unlike Surfer, Scalenut includes an AI writing assistant that can create various content formats (blogs, ebooks, emails) fueled by real-time SERP data and social trends. The platform also provides SEO optimization based on over 200 ranking factors, offering more comprehensive optimization than Surfer. It also includes plagiarism checking and supports multiple industries, making it versatile for agencies handling diverse clients. Interface While it’s not winning any design awards, Scalenut’s interface is functional and user-friendly. The dashboard gives you a quick overview of your projects, and the sidebar menu makes it easy to jump between different tools. The Content Optimizer is clean and distraction-free, with the real-time SEO score being a particularly useful feature. While it may not be as visually appealing as Surfer’s interface, Scalenut’s layout is intuitive once you get used to it. New users, however, might find the long list of features a bit overwhelming at first. Reviews Scalenut enjoys a 4.7 rating from users out of 302 reviews on G2. User reviews generally praise Scalenut’s AI writing assistant and SEO features. Many users report significant time savings, especially when creating first drafts. Its SEO optimization capabilities are also frequently mentioned in a positive light. However, some users mention that its AI-generated content can sound robotic if not properly edited. This is a common critique for AI writing tools, including those in Surfer. Price Compared to Surfer SEO, which starts at $89/month for its basic plan, Scalenut’s entry-level Essential plan is much more affordable, at $39/month. While Scalenut’s Essential plan lets you generate five articles per month (compared to Surfer’s 30), it provides access to more SEO tools and has greater capacity for content creation. All Scalenut plans come with a 7-day free trial, allowing users to test the platform before committing. Plus, a Link Manager add-on is available for $19/month, covering 1000 pages with an extra $5 for every additonal 500 pages. Pros✅ Comprehensive all-in-one platform for SEO and content creation AI-powered content generation with “Cruise Mode” Automated brief creation based on SERP data and social trends Optimization based on over 200 ranking factors Supports multiple industries and content types Real-time SEO scoring and optimization suggestions Cons❌ May have a steeper learning curve due to extensive features AI-generated content requires human editing Verdict Scalenut is one of the best Surfer SEO alternatives. It’s ideal for content creators, SEO agencies, and businesses that need to produce a large amount of content regularly. But althought its AI capabilities are impressive and can accelerate the content creation process, human oversight is still crucial. Agencies absolutely should consider this tool. Its ability to automate SEO planning, research, writing, optimization, and publishing in one platform could significantly boost agency productivity. The collaborative features and integrations in Scalenut’s higher-tier plans are also beneficial for client- and team-based work. 7. WriterZen Functionality WriterZen’s functionality covers the entire content creation lifecycle, from initial topic ideation through to final originality checks. Its feature set includes a Topic Discovery tool for generating content ideas, a Keyword Explorer that taps into Google’s database to find high-demand keywords, and a Keyword Planner for keyword clustering and creating content briefs. It also provides a built-in plagiarism checker and a GPT-3.5-powered AI writing assistant. However, the product is relatively new to the market, and its keyword research features may not be as robust or accurate as those of more established tools in the industry. Interface Compared to Surfer SEO, WriterZen’s interface is pretty straightforward and less data-heavy. It’s clean, not too cluttered, and easy to navigate. This platform clearly focuses on making workflows smooth, ensuring all the tools you need are within easy reach. However, Surfer SEO provides many charts, graphs, and filters. This is perfect for digging deep into your SEO strategy. But if you want more detailed data, you might find this tool to be a bit basic. Ultimately, it all comes down to your working style and what you need from your SEO content tool. Reviews WriterZen receives mixed reviews. It currently has a 4.7 rating based on 201 reviews, which is solid. Users appreciate its AI writing capabilities and user-friendly interface. However, some users mention its lack of features for creating content from start to finish. Additionally, some reviewers feel the keyword research tool could be more robust. Price This pricing structure is vastly different from Surfer SEO’s subscription model. Instead of the usual monthly subscription, WriterZen offers one-time payments, starting at $135 for the US market and coming with basic keyword research features. Its mid-tier All-In-One Basic plan is priced at $270 and offers more comprehensive tools like the Content Creator and plagiarism checker. WriterZen’s top-tier All-In-One Advanced plan costs $405, adding extra keyword credits and team collaboration features. Pros✅ Comprehensive all-in-one platform for SEO and content creation Unique one-time payment model with no recurring fees GPT-3.5 powered AI writing assistant Strong focus on topic discovery and keyword research Team collaboration features Cons❌ One-time payment model might not suit users who prefer more flexible, subscription-based options Keyword research tool could be more in-depth Verdict WriterZen is a worthy Surfer SEO alternative. It offers a comprehensive toolkit for the entire content production process. It’s great for agencies because it bundles everything from topic discovery, keyword research, team features, and AI writing assistance into one package. Additionally, the platform’s one-time payment model could be a budget-saver, especially compared to monthly subscriptions. On the other hand, you should examine the tool’s article limits and feature depth closely to ensure you’re getting everything you need. 8. Semrush Writing Assistant Functionality The Semrush Writing Assistant is one of the components of the massive SEO suite of tools. It enables you to enhance your content by optimizing important keywords, improving readability and engagement, maintaining your tone of voice, and verifying originality to avoid plagiarism. The tool provides scores for readability, target word count, consistency, tone, and originality. It also offers real-time data and insights on your biggest competitors for the keywords you care most about. It’s even compatible with Google Docs, WordPress, and Microsoft Office 365. User interface While it takes time to learned how to navigate the entire Semrush platform takes, the Writing Assistant itself is fairly straightforward. You can enter in your target keyword and region, and the tool will evaluate your content and offer improvement suggestions. It also makes it easy to see how your pages stack up against competing pages. Reviews On G2, Semrush has 2,086 reviews and an overall 4.5 out of 5 stars. The biggest complaints by far and one of the reasons users search for alternatives to Semrush is its price and steep learning curve. The tool is far more complex than some of its counterparts. Although this might not be a hurdle for enterprise companies, freelancers and SMBs might not have the budget and manpower to handle Semrush. Pricing You will need a Semrush account to use the Writing Assistant. With a free account, you can create a single template and link it to your Google Docs. If you want more access, the Guru subscription is necessary, priced at $249.95 a month. This subscription grants access to the entire Content Marketing toolkit, which also includes Topic Research and the SEO Content Template. So, you do get more, but for the budget-conscious, Surfer SEO will be much friendlier on your wallet. Pros✅ Part of a comprehensive SEO suite Real-time competitor data and SEO insights Compatibility with Google Docs, WordPress, and MS Word 365 Comprehensive content scoring (readability, word count, tone, etc.) Various content quality checkers included Cons❌ Steep learning curve for the full Semrush platform Expensive compared to standalone content tools Requires a higher-tier subscription for full access Might be overwhelming for freelancers or small businesses Verdict Semrush’s Writing Assistant is a powerful content tool nestled within a broader SEO ecosystem. For agencies already using Semrush’s suite, it’s a no-brainer addition that integrates seamlessly with existing content workflows. However, it’s not a standalone solution like Surfer SEO. The high price point and steep learning curve of the full Semrush platform make it less appealing for smaller agencies or those focused solely on content optimization. 9. Copywritely Functionality Copywritely offers a range of features, such as a duplicate content checker, grammar checker, readability checker, word counter, article rewriter, alphabetizer, keyword SERP checker, keyword density checker, a words-to-minutes calculator, and a words-to-pages converter. These features are accessible for free, but with limits. By opting for a paid version, you can get many different benefits, including support for nine languages, keyword research, competitor analysis, analysis of up to 10,000 words per check, task automation, custom task creation, and report generation. User interface While Copywritely may not fully align with the latest design trends, it is easy enough to use. The platform’s functionality is sufficient, although some users await modernization. This is an aspect that the Copywritely team will likely address in the future, as they are relatively new to the market. Reviews Copywritely is one of the newer kids on the block. With 13 reviews on G2 and an overall score of 4.1 out of 5 stars, it’s showing promise. Some users are eager for more updates, which is understandable for a new service that’s finding its footing in the market. Copywritely is a work in progress, and we’re curious to see how it evolves and adapts to user demands. Pricing Similar to Content Harmony, Copywritely’s pricing offers a sliding scale model based on the pages per month you plan to use it for. For example, 50 pages cost $29 per month, while 500 pages cost $150. Based on the reviews and personal experiences of Copywritely’s users, Copywritely doesn’t seem to be too reliable, especially for bigger companies. Consider what your business needs are, what you can afford, and whether or not the tool you’re considering can rise to the challenge! Pros✅ Wide range of free features Paid version supports nine languages Flexible, usage-based pricing Competitor and keyword analysis included Cons❌ Large businesses may need more robust features Rarely updates Lack of agency-specific features Verdict Copywritely is a budget-friendly content tool that offers several features for free. Copywritely might be ideal for small agencies or freelancers on a budget who need basic content-checking tools. However, agencies looking for a more comprehensive content optimization solution might find its feature set underwhelming. As with many newer tools in the market, this tools strikes a respectable balance between cost and functionality. However, some users note that the platform has room for improvement in terms of performance and innovation. Copywritely, being a new platform, has the potential for growth. Let’s give it more time. 10. Topic Functionality Unlike Surfer SEO’s focus on content optimization, Topic specializes in content brief creation and planning. It helps users create content that avoids keyword stuffing, fills content gaps, and captures long-tail search traffic. Topic is designed to streamline the content creation process and help users produce high-quality, well-researched content efficiently. Its key features include AI-driven keyword research based on top Google results, an Outline Builder for efficient content structuring, and a Content Grader for optimization. The recent release of Topic’s Copilot add-on enhances its capabilities, offering AI-powered writing assistance that adapts to the user’s style. Interface Topic boasts a clean, intuitive interface designed with efficiency in mind. The workflow is logical, guiding users from the planning stage to outline creation and then to content optimization. Its straightforward design makes it accessible for users of all experience levels. Reviews While Topic boasts a perfect 5.0-star rating on G2, its review count (currently at 37) is lower compared to some competitors. Existing reviews sing its praises, noting the platform’s time-saving benefits and potential to unearth hidden insights missed by manual research. This positive sentiment suggests it’s worth a closer look for agencies thinking about making a switch. Price Topic’s pricing structure is simple and transparent, with annual options offered at a 20% discount. Its starter plans cost $99/month, giving you 10 content briefs, 1 user seat, and $10 for an extra brief, perfect for solo content creators or small, new startups. The Premium plan, at $299/month, is built for large agencies, offering 50 content briefs and 5 available seats for team members, and $6 for per extra brief. All plans come with a keyword research tool and a month of rollover for unused briefs. While it’s pricier than Surfer SEO’s $89 entry point, Topic’s per-brief cost drops as you scale up. Pros✅ Comprehensive AI-powered research Intuitive interface and workflow Based on NLP technology Transparent and scalable pricing structure Cons❌ More expensive than some competitors Primarily a planning tool, may need pairing with other content optimization software for full SEO coverage Verdict Topic is well-suited both for agencies and individual content creators, prioritizing quality research and AI-powered efficiency. Agencies may find its shareable links, managed accounts, and referrals to be especially handy. These features promote seamless collaboration with in-house teams, freelancers, and even clients. Note that Topic is primarily a planning tool. If you need full SEO optimization, consider pairing it with something else. Why would people look for Surfer SEO alternatives? While Surfer is a solid content tool with consistently positive reviews (508 total with an overall rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars), there’s always room for improvement. Here’s what makes people look for Surfer SEO competitors. Value for money. Some users find Surfer SEO’s pricing less feasible, especially if they don’t fully utilize their credits. The inability to pause an account or add credits when needed adds frustration. With its new pricing plans offering fewer features and credits at higher prices, the number of complaints will likely increase. Dubious recommendations and lack of transparency. While the tool does much of the heavy lifting for you, it doesn’t always provide clear explanations of its conclusions. Some users have noted that Surfer’s topic clusters may not work effectively for SEO, and keyword suggestions can be off-topic, potentially leading to unreadable text if all keywords, headings and other recommendations are followed. Steep learning curve. Surfer SEO is quite a user-friendly content tool, but it still can be overwhelming for novice users. On top of that, the tool doesn’t offer decent training materials, making it even more challenging for clients to grasp the basics and use the tools effectively. Lack of advanced SEO features. While Surfer SEO is a powerful content editor, it still lacks other SEO and content features despite its higher price point. Some users commented that Surfer’s Website Audit and Grow Flow tools are of little help for SEO, and with the new pricing plans, both features will cost you extra. Keep in mind that Surfer SEO doesn’t have a free plan. Its most basic plan costs $89 a month and allows you to write 30 articles a month, each additional article coming at $5 each. More robust plans come in at $129 and $219, offering more articles and user seats. All the plans include 100 daily keyword research reports. If you want to perform other tasks, such as generating content with the help of AI (except for the Scale AI plan with 10 AI articles included), auditing your site, and performing on-page optimization, you’ll need to pay extra for each tool. Conclusion There you have it, an exhaustive list of top Surfer SEO alternatives to choose from. While Surfer SEO remains a great choice, some of the alternatives on this list can offer better value, more agency-focused features, and better user experience. Agencies might find SE Ranking or Semrush’s Writing Assistant more suitable for performing comprehensive SEO campaigns and optimizing content at scale. On the other hand, solo creators will likely choose more budget-friendly options like Frase or Copywritely for basic content optimization needs. Either way, we encourage you to evaluate these options based on your unique needs. Take advantage of the free trials these tools offer and test drive the ones that appeal most to you. Frequently asked questions What is the best Surfer SEO alternative? SE Ranking is the strongest competitor on this list. It’s cost-effective, jam-packed with valuable features, and suits a wide range of professionals and businesses, ranging from bloggers to enterprise companies. Is there a free version of Surfer SEO? No, there is no free plan for Surfer SEO. A monthly subscription is required, starting at $89. Is Surfer SEO worth it? While Surfer SEO is a formidable tool for content marketing, it’s not the most cost-effective or flexible option. Bigger companies with heftier budgets might find it suitable, but you should definitely explore alternative options as well. Megan has been writing and editing professionally since 2011.
