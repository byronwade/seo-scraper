Backlink Checker is another Linkody tool that enables you to analyze any domain’s backlink profile right on the landing page. It’s a free tool, and the maximum number of referring domains you can analyze per site is 100 (note that this is not enough to represent the whole backlink profile). The tool provides site metrics like domain authority score, the number of backlinks and referring domains, unique IPs, etc. The list below shows the backlinks of an analyzed domain next to its essential link data, including domain rating, referring page, anchor text, and dofollow/nofollow attributes. Linkody’s free Website Authority Checker shows you how authoritative any website is based on Moz and Majestic scores: Domain Authority by Moz calculates site authority based on the number of and quality of links. Trust Flow by Majestic calculates site authority based on the quality of links. Citation Flow by Majestic measures how many backlinks a website has. These metrics help SEOs navigate the backlink landscape, and they depend on multiple factors. But on a fundamental level, the more authority a website has, the higher it will rank on search engines. Linkody’s Website Spam Score Checker helps you check your website’s risk of being penalized by Google. The score shows if your website has potentially harmful backlinks. The higher the spam score, the greater likelihood that your website will be penalized. If your website receives a penalty, it will lose most or all of its organic traffic. This is why it’s crucial to maintain a low spam score to avoid receiving a penalty. Pricing With Linkody, you pay for a single Backlink Tracker tool.
