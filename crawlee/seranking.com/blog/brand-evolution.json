Maybe you even thought you landed on the wrong website. Rest assured that was us! We adopted a new visual language full of vibrancy, dynamism, and boldness. It‚Äôs a big change from the soft pastel colors you used to see, but these bold moves were a long time coming given how much we have evolved over the years. Determined to bridge the gap between fast-paced industry changes and modern SEO solutions, our platform underwent major transformations. SE Ranking‚Äôs upgraded brand DNA fuses innovative technologies, high-end data quality, and an overall smooth user experience. If you‚Äôve been with us for a while, you‚Äôve already experienced our brand evolution first-hand. If you never tried SE Ranking before, we have a special offer for you. In this article, we will focus on big changes we‚Äôve embraced that empower SEO pros like you to stay ahead of the game. But first, let‚Äôs look at the story behind SE Ranking‚Äôs new brand identity. Behind the Curtain: SE Ranking‚Äôs Brand Evolution SE Ranking started as a simple rank tracker back in 2013. Eleven years of transformation turned SE Ranking into a comprehensive ecosystem that includes: Powerful and intuitive platform fuelled by cutting-edge technologies. A blog with 200+ guides, industry research, surveys, and more. An Academy with 8 courses on SEO, content, agency management, and SE Ranking tools. 100+ online events available on demand.

We combine our in-house expertise with the top minds in SEO to deliver insights to everyone passionate about SEO. SE Ranking has evolved over the years, and our brand identity has changed with it. The next logical step is to match our verbal and visual messages with the company SE Ranking has become, and we‚Äôre leaping into that future today! Nicole Borman PR Manager at SE Ranking To better understand what SE Ranking truly represents, we reached out to both our clients and colleagues asking what SE Ranking‚Äôs mission is, what drives us, what vision we pursue, what values guide us along the way, what character our company has, and what emotions it evokes. We gained incredibly perceptive insights that we hadn‚Äôt ever considered before. For instance, some users see SE Ranking as an innovative company. We‚Äôve always aimed to evolve quickly and be among the first to adopt the latest technologies to make SEO simple and intuitive, but we hadn‚Äôt thought of it as a key part of how users perceive us. The most pleasant insight was that 98% of SE Ranking teammates are proud to work for a company that is both flexible and dynamic, but well-established and experienced. Both you, our users, and the SE Ranking team, described our brand as trustworthy, friendly and wise, but also as ambitious and motivated. It will probably won‚Äôt come as a surprise then that our brand‚Äôs archetype is 80% Sage and 20% Hero. Our new logo and visual identity were designed to match these archetypes. SE Ranking‚Äôs logo consists of two upward-pointing arrows that embody our mission to spur business growth with innovative SEO solutions. Together, they form an ‚ÄúS‚Äù sign. A mix of sharp and rounded angles represents the balance between being growth-driven and people-centric. While SE Ranking celebrates continuous development, we always put our customers and team first. Nastya Dulhiier Brand Designer at SE Ranking At SE Ranking, our brand evolution is much more than a visual refresh‚Äîit reflects our journey and commitment to our users. We made our new design choices carefully, balancing the dynamic nature of our growth with the clarity and trust we‚Äôve established over the years. We opted for a vibrant but balanced color palette to inject energy into our communication while preserving the professionalism our users rely on. We chose each design element to reflect our core values: empowering people, inspiring action, and delivering clarity. Our brand now embodies the perfect blend of bold innovation and grounded stability. The new SE Ranking is modern but mature, laconic but lively. Let‚Äôs look at the key features and initiatives that led to this transformation. AI Results Tracker and AI Overview Studies to keep you at the forefront of GenAI The SEO industry must adapt as new tools backed by LLMs continue to change user search habits. We may soon witness the rise of AI search engines. We are committed to being your reliable partner in the new search era. SE Ranking has actively monitored Google‚Äôs GenAI initiatives since the launch of AI Overviews (ex SGE.) Back in 2023, we were among the first SEO companies to start working on a tool for tracking AI snippets, and it was first available to a limited number of closed beta testing participants. Since August 2024, our very own Al Overviews Tracker is finally live and included in our Pro and Business subscription plans üéâ Take some time to set it up and start tracking AIOs for your top keywords. You can also check which keywords‚Äîyours or your competitors‚Äô‚Äîtrigger AIOs with our Competitive Research tool. All SE Ranking users have access to this newly launched feature. While the SE Ranking dev team worked on improving our AI Overviews Tracker, the SEO team collaborated with developers and content marketers to study the impact of AIOs on the SEO industry. In February 2024, we conducted extensive research based on 100,000 keywords. Two more AI Overview studies followed, where we analyzed the same set of 100K keywords. The first one investigated how the number of AI snippets and their characteristics changed pre-and post-AIO rollout. The second extensive research focused on AIO sources. Finally, we released a manual study last week investigating the difference between how Search GPT, Google and Bing handle various types of queries. Our next ad-focused AIO research is scheduled for this week. Subscribe to the SE Ranking digest to get your hands on it. It comes with a PDF containing findings from our second AIO research study.

SE Ranking‚Äôs SEO tools powered by AI and ML technologies Search engines are not the only ones using AI and ML technologies. Almost every SEO and marketing tool out there claims that it‚Äôs driven by some sort of AI or ML techunder the hood, but don‚Äôt get too skeptical. When applied wisely, AI and ML can improve data quality by a wide margin and deliver unique Insights. SE Ranking combines AI and ML technologies with proprietary engineering solutions to empower users to make smarter data-driven decisions: SE Ranking has integrated ML tech into its Competitive Research tool for more accurate traffic forecasting.

SE Ranking‚Äôs AI Insights Tool analyzes your projects and highlights issues that can significantly boost site visibility when addressed.

Expanded and enhanced datasets to supercharge your strategies We already mentioned that ML tech has allowed SE Ranking to forecast website traffic more precisely.

Our backlink index features 411 million domains, and we crawl 14 billion pages daily to ensure that 58% of our backlinks get updated within 90 days. This makes SE Ranking‚Äôs backlink data fresh and relevant. It also enhances the accuracy of our Domain Trust, Page Trust, and Keyword Difficulty metrics. So, we‚Äôre proud to say that we have made significant strides in expanding our datasets and enhancing the accuracy of crucial SEO metrics, including: Traffic forecast Keyword search volume Keyword difficulty Domain Trust and Page Trust Delivering reliable SEO data that you can act on is our mission.
