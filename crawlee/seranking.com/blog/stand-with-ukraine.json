You must have seen videos of the cities being destroyed by missile strikes and shelling, images of people fleeing to neighboring countries or hiding in the shelters, but also the stories of fierce resistance. Both Ukrainian military forces and ordinary people demonstrate incredible courage and keep stalling the advance of the Russian troops. A big part of the SE Ranking team are Ukrainians. Some of us have spent days on the road striving to bring our families to a safer place. Some are still in Kyiv and other cities of Ukraine, trying to do their daily routine to the sounds of air raid sirens. All of us feel scared and devastated, but also hopeful and strong. In the past days, we received dozens of support messages from our customers and partners—every such message fills our hearts with faith and determination to withstand. Many are willing to help, so we decided to put together a list of options at hand. To help Ukrainian arm forces protect civilians from the atrocities of war, donate through this charity: https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate-en/#donate-army-card-monthly Directly: https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi Or join the fundraising organized by one of the Ukrainian banks (quick payments via Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal): https://uahelp.monobank.ua/ Provide support to 7.5 million Ukrainian children: https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/conflict-ukraine-pose-immediate-threat-children For some of you, there’s an option to provide Ukrainians with direct humanitarian aid. Nova Poshta, a major Ukrainian postal service, will be delivering all the goods brought to its global warehouse to those in need in Ukraine. There are warehouses in the USA🇺🇸, the UK🇬🇧, Poland🇵🇱, Germany🇩🇪, France🇫🇷 and Italy🇮🇹, you can find the addresses here: https://www.europeaninterest.eu/article/nova-poshta-global-starts-delivering-humanitarian-aid-to-ukraine/ If you have such an opportunity, join thousands of people all over the world protesting against the war in Ukraine. If not, make a statement on social media. Currently, many governments and international organizations are making decisive steps that help Ukraine in this battle. It happens not only thanks to the efforts of the diplomats but also thanks to millions of voices from all over the world that have been heard. Finally, send some love to Ukrainians you are personally acquainted with—those living in Ukraine as well as those praying for its future from abroad. Your support heals our broken hearts ❤️ In the meantime, SE Ranking team will be doing its best to provide you with top-quality service. Our servers are located in Germany, they are all up and running, which means you should not face any problems using any of our tools. Our customer care team currently has limited capacities, but we’re trying hard to swiftly respond to all your inquiries. We also keep working on developing the new tools, though at a slightly slower pace. At the same time, we’ve ceased our operations in Russia—users won’t be able to sign up for SE Ranking, and we won’t be accepting payments from Russian customers. We’ll keep informing you about the situation on our blog, social media, and via newsletters. Once again, big thanks to all of you for supporting the SE Ranking team. Today, the whole world stands with Ukrainians, the nation is united as ever, and it means that we have no other choice but to win. 16837 views Written by Svetlana Shchehel Svetlana is the Head of Content at SE Ranking.
