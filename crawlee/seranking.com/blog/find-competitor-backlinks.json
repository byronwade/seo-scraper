Let’s take a close look into the step-by-step process of working with Bing: 1️⃣ Start by selecting the Backlinks section and then click on the Backlinks to Any Site tab. 2️⃣ Add your competitors’ websites for comparison. 3️⃣ Initially, in the Top referring domains tab, you will encounter domain-level information that offers insights into websites linked to your competitors. Choose the View detailed report option. 4️⃣ To narrow your focus, apply the filter labeled Show domains not linking to my site.

How to know about competitors’ new mentions Mentions are a goldmine waiting to be tapped. If a website mentions your competitor, it’s highly likely that it’s relevant to your site as well and might include a potential backlink. This opens the door to reaching out for link building prospects. Here’s how to stay in the loop: Use Google search operators combo Utilize search operators like “competitor_brand” after:a specific date to uncover recent mentions of your competitors. Let’s observe this method in action. For instance, we applied this operator to Google: “apple” after 2024-02-25 The result? Numerous websites featuring mentions of your competitor after February 25, 2024. Set up Google Alerts Configure Google Alerts to receive timely notifications directly to your email whenever your competitors are mentioned online. Think of Google Alerts as your personal assistant, tirelessly scanning the web to keep you informed. You’ll receive emails when new results for your topic appear in Google Search. All you need to do is enter a keyword you wish to track (in our case, it’s a competitor’s brand name), select how often you would like to receive alerts, fine tune other settings, and hit the Create Alert button. Whenever your competitors are mentioned, you’ll receive a notification in your inbox. This proactive approach ensures you’re always in the know, ready to seize opportunities and transform mentions into valuable backlinks. Capitalizing these mentions gives you the chance to reach out to either the author of the post or the main contact on the website. You can inquire if they’d be interested in adding a link back to your website along with the mention of your brand. For instance, a post mentioning multiple competitors could be an ideal moment to ask for a link to your website. Responding swiftly to these mentions can not only help you secure backlinks but also foster relationships within your industry. Wrapping up Google consistently compares your site’s search engine optimization efforts to those of your competitors during its ranking process. One of the most critical factors Google focuses on is your link profile. If you want to look decent and get ahead of your competitors, you need to keep an eye on their off-page SEO strategies. Employ the techniques we highlighted in this article about finding competitors’ backlinks to enhance your own backlink profile. Explore tools like SE Ranking’s Backlink Analysis tool and Backlink Gap Analyzer, tap into Bing Webmaster Tools, and harness the power of mentions to fuel your own backlink arsenal.
