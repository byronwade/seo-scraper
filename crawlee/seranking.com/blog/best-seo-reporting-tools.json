Can experts and beginners alike navigate its reporting and other features without difficulty? White Label functionality: Does the tool allow agencies to brand their reports? Is this feature included in the basic pricing plan or at an additional cost? Automation: How well does the tool streamline the reporting process? What tasks can it automate? Integration with other services: What software does the tool support, and how easy is the integration process? Pre-built report templates: Does the tool provide any ready-made templates? If so, how many and which ones are available? Custom report templates: Can users modify templates to create personalized SEO reports for their clients? Additional services: What other functionalities and services does the tool offer besides reporting? Do they cost extra? Flexibility of pricing policy: Does the tool offer different pricing plans to suit different needs? Are custom billing models available? Is pricing information transparent, and is there a clear cancellation policy? 1. SE Ranking SE Ranking’s SEO Report Generator offers a dashboard that doesn’t confuse its users, customization features to make reports from scratch unique, pre-designed templates to streamline report creation and different SEO data export and sharing options. You can report on almost anything, including rankings, backlinks, competitors, target keywords, website technical health, local SEO, and much more. You can also add data from GSC, GA, and Matomo Analytics to the SE Ranking’s report. Extra features for agencies You can send guest links to your clients or let them access essential tools directly.

SE Ranking also offers a specialized Agency Pack that includes unlimited automated reports, a White Label feature, a Lead Generator, an Agency Catalog, and additional seats for your clients. Agencies can also take advantage of SE Ranking’s API included in the platform’s Business subscription. Pricing SE Ranking has three different subscription options: The Essential package: Priced at $55/mo, ideal for small agencies with up to 10 clients (projects). It lets you deliver 5 scheduled reports per month. The Pro package: This option costs $109/mo and is the perfect choice for medium agencies with an unlimited number of projects, 3 user seats, and 20 scheduled reports monthly. The Business option: This option is priced at $239/mo and lets you manage as many projects as you need, invite up to 5 teammates, and send up to 50 automated reports monthly. Each plan includes unlimited manual reports, 12+ ready-to-use report templates, and guest links. Agency Pack add-on costs $50/mo with Pro and Business yearly plans. Compared to other reporting tools on the market, such pricing is pretty generous. But if you want to save even more, choose the annual billing option that gives you 20% off. The platform offers 14-day free trial. Pros ✅ Great customization options. ✅ White Label feature. ✅ Unlimited manual reporting and generous limits on automated reporting, with an unlimited option in the Agency Pack. ✅ Seamless integrations with tools like Looker Studio, Google Analytics & Search Console, Zapier, SeoTools for Excel, Reportz.io. ✅ 12+ ready-to-use SEO report templates included in all pricing plans. ✅ Ease of use proved by user rate (9.3/10, while the average for SEO tools is 8.9). ✅ Comprehensive suite with tools for SEO audits, keyword research, rank tracking, etc. The platform has one of the best link-building tools and offers special tools for competitor analysis and on-page audit. SE Ranking also features an AI-driven AI Writer that is a part of the Content Editor. Cons ❌ Limited flexibility within its automated reports. ❌ Collaboration limitations. Verdict SE Ranking is one of the best SEO software for agencies out there. It comes with expert yet user-friendly SEO reporting tools and caters to different user needs. The platform’s pricing plans are diverse. There’s a special package for agencies that offers more than just white-label SEO reporting tools. SE Ranking doesn’t focus solely on reports. It offers a variety of features, including one of the best rank-tracking software. 2. SEO PowerSuite SEO PowerSuite lets users create reports covering rankings, SEO audits, and backlinks. The platform ensures data accuracy, making it one of the best SEO reporting tools. Pricing SEO PowerSuite offers several pricing plans: Free Plan lacks scheduled reports, SEO data exporting, and project saving but is free forever. Lite Plan is priced at $99/year and is ideal for small SEO projects. Professional Plan costs $299/year and includes unlimited data for in-house use. Enterprise Plan costs $499/year and is designed for SEO professionals and agencies. Features like printing reports on paper, saving them as PDFs, scheduling and delivering reports, and exporting data in specific formats, are available only in the Enterprise Plan. SEO PowerSuite doesn’t have a monthly payment option. You can also buy a specific tool you need at a reduced price. Pros ✅ Different reporting formats (HTML and PDF) and delivery methods (email, site upload, or saving files to device) ✅ Various templates and customization features, including White Label ✅ Automated reporting based on user-defined schedules ✅ Access to four comprehensive SEO tools Cons ❌ Limited functionality of reporting and SEO tools ❌ The number of features provided doesn’t justify the price ❌ Complete reporting capabilities are only available in the most expensive pricing plan ❌ No monthly payment option ❌ The tool is complex to use (8.6/10 Ease of Use rating on G2) ❌ The subscription renewal policy is unclear Verdict SEO PowerSuite allows its users to create reports covering all essential SEO metrics. The tool has pre-designed and customizable templates, a White Label feature, and scheduled report delivery. However, advanced reporting features are only available in the higher-priced Enterprise version. By choosing this tool, you’ll also have to pay for the whole year ahead. 3. AgencyAnalytics AgencyAnalytics is a great solution for those of you who need detailed and visually appealing reports on anything from rankings, website traffic, and Google Ads to emails, call tracking, etc. It has 75+ integrations with different instruments. You can automate report delivery, customize templates, fine-tune them to match your brand. AgencyAnalytics includes a CRM that helps manage client contact details and a Project Management Tool. With all this, no wonder, it’s on this list of the best SEO reporting tools. Pricing AgencyAnalytics charges based on client campaigns. With the Freelancer plan, you must buy at least five campaigns. With $12/mo for each campaign, expect to pay at least $60/mo. The Agency plan requires you to buy at least 10 client campaigns and pay $18/mo per each. Pricing for the Enterprise plan can be customized based on each user’s needs. The minimum number of campaigns is 50. The White Label is only available after purchasing the Agency and Custom packages. Pros ✅ Automated reporting and custom dashboards ✅ 100% white-label reporting ✅ 75 marketing integrations ✅ Additional SEO tools ✅ Exceptional ease of use (9.5/10 on G2) Cons ❌ Limited accuracy ❌ Limited number of features compared to other SEO platforms ❌ Variable pricing structures that can be costly for agencies handling many campaigns Verdict Being one of the best tools for SEO reporting, AgencyAnalytics offers tons of integrations, customization options, and a user-friendly platform. However, the platform has some pitfalls regarding SEO data accuracy and its feature set is also limited compared to SEO tools like SE Ranking and reporting tools like Databox. 4. Semrush With Semrush solutions, you can create customized reports covering multiple marketing channels, including SEO, content marketing, competitor analysis, PPC, and more. Extra features for agencies Semrush offers a special Agency Growth Kit, which includes a spot in the Agency Directory to expand your agency’s visibility, a CRM tool to organize reports by customer profile, and a Client Portal to monitor project progress and achieved SEO results. Pricing Semrush divides its pricing into three primary tiers: Pro: $129.95/mo, includes five scheduled PDF reports. Guru: $249.95/mo, allows for 20 scheduled PDF reports and offers a Looker Studio Integration. Business: $499.95/mo, permits users to generate up to 50 scheduled PDF reports. Note that there might be additional expenses ranging between $69 and $149/mo for extra functionalities like adding more users or buying the Agency Growth Kit. Pros ✅ Automated SEO reports ✅ Variety of pre-made templates ✅ White-labeling features ✅ Multiple integrations ✅ Comprehensive offering with one of the best website audit tools Cons ❌ Unlike many Semrush competitors, it only offers reports in PDF format ❌ Steep pricing with the most basic package at $129.95/month ❌ Additional costs for agencies’ features ❌ High learning curve (8.4 Ease of Use rating on G2) Verdict As a popular dedicated SEO platform, Semrush has a lot to offer: powerful reporting, automation features, pre-made templates, integrations, white labeling, and CRM. However, the reports are PDF-only. High entry pricing with possible added expenses can result in higher costs. While these may not be big issues for well-resourced companies, smaller teams should think twice about whether Semrush fits their budget and needs. 5. Moz Moz offers features like keyword analysis, position tracking, site crawling and auditing, and one of the best SEO reporting tools on the market. It also has Moz Local tool, Moz Pro for on and off-page optimization, and Moz STAT for tracking large amounts of keywords. Pricing Moz Pro, comes with four pricing plans: Standard at $99/mo doesn’t include white-labeling and specific report templates. Medium at $179/mo provides more comprehensive features for advanced SEO tasks. Large at $299/mo is designed for businesses with more extensive requirements. Premium at $599/mo offers the broadest set of tools. All pricing plans include unlimited scheduled PDF reports. Pros ✅ Customized reporting in PDF or CSV formats ✅ White-labeling feature ✅ Ready-made templates ✅ Automated report scheduling Cons ❌ Moz competitors like SE Ranking and Semrush offer a broader feature set while being less expensive ❌ Insufficient integration between tools ❌ Usability concerns (8.7 Ease of Use rating on G2) ❌ Limited SEO reporting on the basic plan Verdict Moz is a major player in the SEO industry. But when comparing its cost-to-feature ratio to competitors like SE Ranking and Semrush, its overall value for reporting is less obvious. The platform’s issues with integration and feedback on usability indicate significant room for enhancement. From an agency perspective, Moz doesn’t necessarily outshine its rivals. Even though it offers standard features like white-label SEO reporting tools and report scheduling. 6. SpyFu SpyFu has a powerful set of reporting tools. The reports cover competitor analysis, keyword research, rank tracking, and detailed SERP analysis. Pricing SpyFu offers a range of subscription plans: Basic: For $39/mo, users get 10 small domain SEO reports and 10 Google Ads Advisor PPC reports. Professional: Priced at $79/mo, this package provides 30 small-domain SEO reports, 10 medium-domain SEO reports, 30 Google Ads Advisor PPC reports, and white label. Team: At $299/mo, users get unlimited access to small domain SEO reports, 30 medium domain SEO reports, 10 large SEO reports, unlimited Google Ads Advisor PPC reports, and white labeling features. SpyFu’s annual subscription option lets get you the basic plan for as low as $16/month. Pros ✅ Ready-made templates ✅ Easy-to-understand insights ✅ Full customization and white-labeling feature ✅ SEO reports for every sales stage Cons ❌ Report formatting issues ❌ Outdated report design ❌ Limited features Verdict SpyFu’s pre-designed templates help you save time building SEO reports, while customization features and white-labeling allow you to tailor them to meet your clients needs. However, report design can be cumbersome, and formatting lags sometimes. If your primary focus is monitoring competition, SpyFu is a compelling choice. But if you are looking for a broader range of SEO features, other platforms can be a better match. 7. Raven Tools If you’re looking for an all-inclusive digital marketing platform, Raven Tools might be a good choice. It has extensive integration capabilities (30+ tools) and lets you craft reports with all basic marketing metrics. Raven Tools can be considered one of the most essential SEO reporting tools that ensure the report accuracy. Pricing Raven Tools offers a tiered pricing structure: Both Small Biz, priced at $49/mo, and Start, at $109/mo, offer limited white labeling. Grow, Thrive and Lead packages, which are priced at $199/mo, $299/mo and $479/mo, offer full white-label capabilities. All packages include: Automated client reports Flexible report sourcing data from 25+ platforms Customizable dashboard Shareable reports through both URL (HTML) and downloadable PDFs. Real-time report accessibility with live CSV and URL data Raven Tools provides a 7-day free trial. Pros ✅ What You See Is What You Get reporting feature for clear data presentation ✅ White-labeled reports ✅ Integrations with 30+ platforms ✅ Versatile reporting formats (shareable URL and PDF reports) Cons ❌ Despite automatic report scheduling function, manual corrections are required ❌ Limited customization of charts ❌ No inter-account report import ❌ It’s harder to use than other tools (8.4 Ease of use score on G2) Verdict Raven Tools is one of the favorite SEO reporting software on our list because it has tons of invaluable reporting features, especially for agencies. With its competitive pricing similar to other comprehensive SEO solutions, you should seriously consider Raven Tools. But one downside is its slightly intricate interface. 8. Coupler.io Coupler.io is a reporting automation platform. It allows users to create auto-updated dashboards in spreadsheets and BI tools by gathering and combining data from over 50 sources like GA4, GSC, social media, ad platforms, etc. Businesses can get insights into their SEO and overall marketing efforts using white-label dashboard templates or building custom reports with Coupler.io.

Besides, Coupler.io offers a Free Plan with unlimited active data flows, access to all sources, destinations, and dashboard templates. Pros ✅ Over 500 ready-made integrations ✅ Free dashboard templates gallery ✅ Custom reporting ✅ Cross-platform reporting ✅ Report refresh automation ✅ Data transformation functionality Cons ❌ No in-app visualization and reports ❌ Limited SEO data sources ❌ Learning curve complexities Verdict Coupler.io provides robust SEO reporting capabilities. What’s more, it’s a solution for multi-channel marketing reporting with broad functionality and transparent pricing. On another note, creating specific SEO reports may require a more complex technical setup. 9. DashThis Now, let’s look at reporting-first SEO tools like DashThis. It has rich configuration capabilities, enabling users to connect to GA, Facebook, Google Ads, etc. The platform also offers specialized templates and customized reports covering SMM, SEM, PPC, and SEO. Pricing DashThis offers four pricing packages that differ by the number of dashboards provided. Individual Plan: At $45/mo, this plan offers three dashboards. The White label reporting tool is somewhat restricted. Professional Plan: Priced at $139/mo, this package grants access to 10 dashboards and features full white labeling capabilities. Business Plan: For $269/mo, users get 25 dashboards, a white label, and advanced customer service support. Standard Plan: This plan costs $419/mo and offers a minimum of 50 dashboards. Pros ✅ Comprehensive dashboards ✅ Automated data retrieval from various SEO tools and report scheduling ✅ Versatile KPI tracking ✅ High-level customization and white-labeling ✅ Pre-built SEO report templates ✅ User-friendly interface (9 Ease of Use rating on G2) Cons ❌ High pricing for small entities ❌ Learning curve for advanced features ❌ Reporting dashboard limitations for freelancers Verdict DashThis offers plenty of advantages, showcasing extensive functionality. Its versatility, coupled with its user-friendly interface, firmly establishes it as one of the best SEO reporting tools. But by investing slightly more than what you’d pay for three reports in DashThis, you can access tools like SE Ranking or Raven Tools with a more expansive array of SEO features. 10. Databox Databox offers data connection through 100+ native integrations. Users can fetch data from SQL databases or via APIs. The tool offers ready-made dashboard templates and reports for marketing, sales, ecommerce, software development, and SaaS. Extra features for agencies Agencies can list themselves in Databox’s Partner Directory to expand their reach and find more clients. Moreover, Databot offers certifications for agencies. Pricing Databox offers a tiered pricing structure with different user count, data update frequency, and storable historical data: Starter Plan: Priced at $59/mo, ideal for startups and small businesses. Professional Plan: At $169/mo, tailored for mid-sized businesses. Growth Plan: With $399/mo, suitable for high-growth companies. Premium Plan: By paying $999/mo, you get an enterprise reporting platform. Each plan includes three data sources, except for the Premium plan, which offers a starting point of 100 data sources. The platform also offers paid add-ons. The Branding & White-labeling feature comes with an additional fee of $250/mo. Databox offers a lifetime free plan that includes connecting with three data sources. Pros ✅ 100+ one-click integrations ✅ Customizable dashboards ✅ Automated alerts about major fluctuations in essential KPIs ✅ Pre-scheduled reporting ✅ Custom & calculated metrics ✅ Collaboration and sharing Cons ❌ Databoard layout, text editing, and data visualization options could be more robust ❌ Complexity with custom reporting ❌ Data connection issues ❌ Databox doesn’t allow users to choose custom date ranges ❌ Additional costs for White Label Verdict Databox includes an array of unique features, from automatic alerts to top-tier report creation and extensive integrations. On the downside, Databox’s pricing can pose challenges. SEO agencies will feel the pinch most, especially when seeking white-labeling features, which require an additional fee. 11. Reportz Reportz is a reporting platform for digital marketing professionals and agencies. It provides real-time data access and incorporates various marketing tools. Their offerings include PPC reports, social media reports, ecommerce reports, and SEO reports. Pricing Instead of fixed plans with specific features, Reportz is all about the number of dashboards users need. The base price is $29.82/mo and includes three dashboards. If you want more, each additional dashboard costs between $9.94 and $8.50. Pros ✅ Dashboard customization ✅ Automated reporting ✅ White-label reporting ✅ Unrestricted access across plans ✅ Real-time data refresh Cons ❌ Limited integrations ❌ Reduced functionality ❌ User-friendliness concerns (8.1 Ease of Use rating on G2) ❌ Dated user interface Verdict Reportz is a reliable reporting tool with consistent features and no hidden costs. However, alternative options might be more suitable for users looking for wider functionality beyond the reporting tool. The next two tools on our list (Google Looker Studio and Google Analytics) differ from the previous 10 in that they are both provided by Google and can be called free tools. They are already widely used by agencies. But we still decided to include them in this list because these tools can be the foundation for valuable SEO insights. 12. Looker Studio Looker Studio, previously known as Google Data Studio, is a free tool from Google designed for bringing data together. This robust platform can handle everything from conventional metrics to nuanced ecommerce sales data. Pricing Looker Studio offers a free standard version and a premium one called Looker Studio Pro. The standard version provides basic reporting and visualization tools. The Pro version is for bigger tasks, with team workspaces and Google Cloud project linking. It enhances collaboration, with tiered permissions for different roles. The price of the paid version is unknown. Users must contact a Google sales representative. Pros ✅ Almost unlimited integrations ✅ Free tool ✅ Intuitive design ✅ Robust template library ✅ Advanced API ✅ Embedding capability Cons ❌ Unclear pricing structure ❌ Varied costs for add-on integrations ❌ Limited customer support for basic users ❌ Overall SEO performance issues Verdict Looker Studio is a great place to start, especially for beginners. Its basic package is free, making it a worthy candidate for a test run. Its capability to integrate with other tools enhances its appeal. So, when you’re looking at marketing tools, especially SEO platforms, check if they integrate with Looker Studio. This can make the reports management and visualization process even better. 13. Google Analytics Google Analytics is one of the top web analytics tools, used by 86% of people. Its core strength is collecting data from websites and apps and turning it into insightful reports. Once set up, data starts populating in real time. The platform categorizes its reports into two main types: Overview Reports: Summaries that provide a bigger picture view of metrics like ecommerce sales and mobile ad performances. Detailed Reports: These dive into specific areas and provide a more granular view of subjects like individual e-commerce purchase data.
