To send an effective message is a challenging task to do. Yet, when following up, you might want to take all your benefits and advantages out of your pocket to get a response. This is especially true when creating follow up emails after no response. Sending a follow-up requires excellent attention to detail to ensure that the email attracts the eye of the email recipient. You have to remain polite to encourage a reply without being pushy and keep on following up even if the first time was not successful. However, if your follow-ups have not received any response and it seems that you have tried many follow-ups, but nothing seems to work — we have a few tips and tricks to share so you could receive that long-awaited reply! Besides, we will provide some free templates for you to look at and get some inspiration! Let’s get started. Key Takeaways Follow-up emails can increase your response rate from 16% to 27%, with the first subsequent email getting a 40% higher reply rate compared to the initial email. Send your first follow-up within 1-3 days of the previous email to keep the conversation fresh in the recipient’s mind. Avoid using “follow-up” in your email subject line. Instead, use specific, value-adding phrases that clearly state the email’s purpose to improve inbox visibility. Always specify a clear call-to-action (CTA) in your message, making it easy for the target audience to respond or engage. Each email copy should provide new information or insights, rather than simply repeating the initial message. To create effective sales inquiry follow-up emails, don’t resend the same email or use the same CTA. Even after multiple attempts without feedback, keep your tone polite and professional. Avoid aggressive language or emotional reactions in your follow-up sequence. There are follow-up templates for different scenarios, such as after leaving a voicemail, following up on a contract, reconnecting after a networking event, and more. These templates can help improve your email strategy. Consider using email marketing tools like Sender or BuzzStream to help with audience segmentation, tracking open rates, and creating automated follow-up sequences for better results and lead activity tracking. Why Should You Follow-Up? It is essential to follow-up on your query as it significantly increases your chances of receiving a response you have been waiting for. Research shows that specialists who know the power of persistence and follow up per one campaign reach a solid 27%. This is in contrast to the 16% reach of those who don’t send follow-ups. One more interesting insight is that the first follow-up email gets a 40% higher reply rate compared to the initial email. This means that if your initial emails have an average response rate of 10%, a single follow-up email can significantly improve the picture, potentially giving you a 14% average reply rate in return. If you were giving up after the first attempt, now you can see that it might take a little longer to receive a response; however, you have to be patient, motivated, and goal-oriented not to give up. If you have not received a response to your initial email, it does not necessarily mean that the person is not interested. Instead, there might be multiple reasons and explanations why it has happened: perhaps the recipient was too busy, the email got lost in a variety of others, the person has seen the email but simply forgot to reply, or maybe they are out of the office for some time. The point here is that you should not give up so soon and keep following up until you get some sort of response. Of course, if it is negative, stop the chase immediately. Still, the majority of the time, there is a very good explanation behind the recipients, and the statistics mentioned before speak for themselves – look how effective follow-ups are! Common Mistakes in Follow-Up Emails Before we get into follow-up email writing tips and examples, it is essential to know what are the common mistakes so you are aware of them. So let’s check them out and see how they can be avoided: 1. Not following up straight after the matter Timing is important, so following up efficiently is necessary. Instead of waiting for a week or so to send your second follow-up, you should start sooner. Depending on the matter, the first follow-up can be sent within 1-3 days. In that case, the recipient will still remember the topic, and there is more chance they will respond sooner. However, if you wait too long, the subject might already be out of their mind. For example, you are looking to receive some filled out documents from another party. The first follow-up should be sent straight after the conversation. Then, if you have not heard from the recipient, send a polite reminder in the upcoming three days to create a sense of urgency. In that case, the person will reply to you on time, and the tasks you have to complete will be on time. 2. Your subject line says ‘follow-up’ When sending a reminder email, many people tend to state ‘follow-up’ in their subject lines. However, this email most likely will get ignored as it does not add any value. Besides, if the person has forgotten what the matter is about and you do not state it in your subject line, he/she can simply assume that it’s a scam or something irrelevant. For that reason, use your subject line wisely and ensure that it clearly states what the email is about to get the reader’s interest. Also, make sure your follow-up emails convey the priority of your message without being pushy. For example, if you are awaiting further details from a potential lead, rather than saying ‘follow-up’ you could add something like ‘Further information request’. Your query will be more specific and will interest the recipient to open the email. 3. The call to action (CTA) is missing One of the most common mistakes when sending a follow-up email is not including a call to action. Why is it important? A call to action clearly presents what further actions you want the recipient to take, so if you do not identify them, they might simply ignore your email. Be specific and clear about further actions, but also remember to keep a polite and professional tone. For example, when writing a follow-up email, you might want to say something like ‘Please fill out the form attached to this email’ or ‘Respond to this email with a selected time and date for our meeting’ at the end of the main body. The more specific you are, the more precise the instructions for the reader to quickly fulfill them. 4. Not adding value in your main body text If your email starts with ‘I am just following up…’ that is already a red flag. This statement does not provide any value to the recipient. People receive hundreds of emails every day and cannot read them all, so you have to be more specific in stating the aim of your contact. For example, to avoid any invaluable content, clearly state how you can help the recipient: solve the problem, increase sales, or what advantages you can bring. You can also offer them different options to add more details and showcase that you are approachable and happy to arrange the situation in a way that would be handy for both parties. How Do You Follow-Up When You Haven’t Received a Response? If your first email has not reached the goal, do not worry, you still have plenty of chances. Below, are a few tips you should follow when constructing a follow-up email after no response: Do not rush Differently from the first follow-up, this time, you want to be patient and wait a little longer before you send an email again. You should wait at least three days to touch base again after the first follow-up. Do not copy Never resend the same email as a follow-up after no response. You will present a very poor message which might potentially get sent to spam. Every email for a follow-up must be different and have distinctive features. Do not use the same CTA Your call to action must also be different every time. Try different approaches and methods as one of them might catch the recipients’ attention, and they can relate to it. That will lead to a response you are awaiting. Do not be aggressive If you have sent a few follow-ups and have not received any response, you still should be professional and polite. Do not let your emotions take control, as you might destroy the potential lead’s interest. Remember that following up is a process, and it may take several attempts before you receive a response. Do not trick Make sure that your subject line is not tricking the recipient into something. If you exaggerate or add inaccurate information by saying ‘Our call last week’, when there wasn’t a call, or anything similar, you will lose their trust instantly, cause confusion and risk your reputation. Do not say goodbye If you have sent a few sales follow-up emails and have not received any response, do not send a breakup email just yet. Instead, wait a little longer and try to follow up again in a few months’ time. Maybe this time you will be lucky! Moreover, you might need a little help when sending follow-up emails. Email marketing tools like Sender or BuzzStream can help you segment your audience, track and trace opening rates, create automated emails and ensure that your follow-ups successfully reach your targeted recipients.
