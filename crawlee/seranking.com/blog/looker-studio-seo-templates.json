Three essential Looker Studio SEO templates By understanding the needs of SEO specialists (especially the ones who are working in agencies), the SE Ranking team has developed three templates based on our in-house data, data that we continue to refine and expand every day. Our Looker Studio templates include Rankings, Site Audit, and Competitors. Each are fundamental and highly essential when collaborating with clients because they encompass SEO data that clients frequently seek. If you don’t need to analyze a large amount of data from different sources (for which Looker Studio is the best tool), pay attention to SE Ranking’s SEO Report Builder tool. It creates client-friendly reports based on data from SE Ranking’s tools. It’s so easy to create, use, and send these reports to clients and colleagues that you won’t even need reporting skills to do it. Rankings template If you want to show off your clients’ search engine rankings and highlight areas of growth, then you’ll find the following Looker Studio SEO template to be indispensable. It integrates with SE Ranking’s Website Rank Tracker without a hitch and offers a comprehensive assessment of the website’s organic search performance. That being said, let’s get into the details. The initial report page offers a comprehensive overview of keyword rankings. Here you’ll see five data blocks. Rankings data. The graph displays the number of added keywords, the average ranking position of these keywords, and the number of keywords that experienced ranking changes (drops or increases) across all added search engines and regions. This info will help you show your client the overall success of your promotional efforts. Distribution of top positions. The next chart shows how pages are distributed across various SERP positions. You can see here how many pages rank in the top 3, top 10, top 30 and top 100. The more pages ranking in the first two columns, the greater the chance that the website will have a larger amount of visitors. Overall, the chart can reveal the effectiveness of your SEO efforts. If a website already has a leading presence among the top positions, you can plan to start working on improving CTR and optimizing conversion rates. Visibility. This graph shows the percentage of users who may see the site after entering specific search queries into the search engine’s search box. The higher the search visibility of a website, the more likely it is to attract traffic and generate leads. % in Top 10. The next chart shows the share of search queries ranking in the top 10 across various search engines. This can help you show off to your client which search engine their website performs best in. Average position. Here’s where you can see comparisons of positions across different search engines. Note: If one search engine is added to a project, all data will be displayed for that search engine only. Below, you’ll find a detailed overview of every keyword, each paired with vital metrics and data. The Search volume parameter indicates the popularity of a query. The Competition metric shows how tough it is to rank competitively for a keyword. A higher percentage means it’s harder to get your website to the top using that keyword. The CPC metric shows the average cost in USD for each click on a keyword in ads. These two metrics are useful for agencies that provide PPC services. The Organic ranking column reveals the webpage’s average position for a specific keyword. The next column displays the dynamics of keyword ranking changes between the first and last report dates. Numbers without a minus sign indicate how many positions a web page has advanced in rankings, while numbers with a minus sign show how many ranking positions the page has dropped. The final column displays the number of website URLs discovered by Google for this keyword, and, of course, in the specified region. Each of these metrics helps you present a quality comparison of the keywords to your client. Together, these metrics help your client understand the overall success of your promotional efforts for each keyword. Website Audit template To get a quick overview of a website’s SEO health, consider using a Website Audit template, specifically one that uses data from SE Ranking’s Website Audit feature. In this SEO report, clients can gain valuable insights into their website’s performance, view issues prioritized by severity, and understand the steps needed to improve their site’s health. Now, let’s look at the Looker Studio SEO dashboard in detail. The first thing you will see is the Site Health Score. This metric shows the website’s quality based on the tool’s analysis of technical factors like status codes, crawlability and indexability, page speed, mobile-friendliness, CWVs, security, and others. This score can also serve as a benchmark to track improvements over time. Below is a graph with indexed and not indexed pages found, as well as data on the number of crawled pages and URLs found. The report also offers Main domain data. This includes the domain’s expiration date, its number of referring domains and backlinks, Domain Trust score, and its pages in Google, Yahoo, and Bing. The next part of the report shows the website’s Core Web Vitals; these are critical for measuring user experience. Select either the mobile or desktop device type to analyze the metrics for mobile and desktop searches separately. See below the distribution of scanned pages across HTTP status codes. It will show your clients how many pages work properly and how many pages are broken or have issues. The last part of this report reveals issues that must be addressed to make the website function better. The Website Audit identifies areas of a website that need improvement in terms of performance, pages, metadata, content, links, images, speed, usability, and more. The list displays the level of significance of certain issues as well as the number of found errors. This is also where you can see the total number of pages on a website that are blocked from scanning or indexing. It also displays issues with the robots.txt, robots meta tag, canonical tag, etc. Competitors template This Looker Studio SEO template uses data from SE Ranking’s My Competitors feature. It enables you and your clients to assess the site’s ranking performance and search visibility in comparison to its top direct digital rivals. With this data, you’ll know whenever a competitor is speeding past your client or is getting way ahead of the pack in organic and paid search. There are two main report pages. The first displays the competitors overview page, showing the number of keywords, competitors, and search engines that the analysis performed. The next graph is the Traffic forecast. This one shows the estimated volume of traffic that competitors can attract to their websites for your chosen keywords. You and your client can compare your client’s traffic with that of their main SEO competitors. This serves as a benchmark for assessing your (or your client’s) website’s performance. If a competitor’s forecasted traffic is higher, it can serve as a target to strive for. Other graphs, including Visibility, % in Top 10, and Average position were mentioned in the previous section. They are valuable tools that can help both you and your clients gauge the success levels of your competitors in achieving their SEO efforts. You can also filter the data for individual competitors. This allows you to access and manage specific information for each individual website’s traffic, visibility, and average positions. You can also exclude certain websites from the report. The second page displays a table with your competitors’ organic and paid rankings for all your added keywords. This helps you collate data and conduct more in-depth SEO analyses. For additional insights into your own or your clients’ competitors, utilize SE Ranking’s Competitor Analysis tool.
