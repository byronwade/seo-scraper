While some may argue that the importance of backlinks has diminished in recent years, high-quality backlinks still play a significant role in improving your website’s search engine rankings and driving traffic to it. This article discusses the importance of referring domains for SEO and provides insight on how to check referring domains using various metrics. Whether you’re new to SEO or you’re a seasoned pro, tapping into the potential of referring domains is key to improving your website’s search engine rankings. So, let’s hop right in! Key takeaways Referring domains are distinct from backlinks; a single referring domain can have multiple backlinks. Referring websites signal to search engines about the authority and relevancy of your website, which directly influences its search engine rankings and organic traffic. To determine whether a referring domain is high-quality, use the following parameters to assess it: Its referring domain and backlink count Its acquisition rate for new referring sources and backlinks The distribution of links pointing to the referring domain’s homepage and other pages The anchor text distribution of both referring domains and backlinks The geographical distribution map The presence of toxic and broken backlinks within it Use the following link building strategies to get higher quality referring sites: Guest posting Broken link building Digital PR Competitor analysis What is a referring domain? A referring domain is an external website that links to your website. This can include a variety of sources, such as corporate blogs, news sites, educational and governmental websites, social media platforms, forums, online directories, and other websites in your industry or niche. It’s important to keep in mind that not all referring domains are created equal. Links coming from authoritative and relevant websites hold more value than links from low-quality websites. A referring domain is an important SEO metric because it signals to search engines that your content is valuable and relevant. The greater the number of high-quality referring sites linking to your site, the more likely it is that search engines will view your site as authoritative and relevant in your niche or industry. For this reason, you’ll want to focus on building a diverse, high-quality backlink profile. This will help to improve your website’s search engine rankings and attract more traffic to your site. CHECK ANY SITE'S REFERRING DOMAINSGet a 360-degree view of any site's backlink profile: assess its backlinks and referring domains against key parametersAnalyze Referring domains vs backlinks: What is the difference between a referring domain and a backlink? The terms “referring domain” and “backlink” are often used interchangeably, but they actually refer to different things. A backlink is simply a link from one website to another, but a single referring domain may contain several links that lead to your website. When analyzing backlinks, you should closely examine the specific links pointing to your site and their anchor texts. When analyzing referring domains, you should not only consider the overall number but also evaluate the quality of sites linking back to your site. This approach allows you to better understand the diversity and strength of your backlink profile. It’s also useful for identifying areas where you need to improve. By analyzing referring domains, you can identify the high-quality sites that link to your site and focus on building relationships with similar sites in your industry. Backlinks and referring domains are both important SEO metrics to track. By carefully analyzing each, you can better understand your website’s authority, relevance, and SERP visibility. Why referring domains are important Referring domains are important for SEO because they are a major ranking factor for search engines. Whenever your website receives backlinks from authoritative domains, Google considers the content that’s being linked to to be trustworthy. This leads to your site having higher search engine rankings and more organic traffic. Referring sites are especially important because they reflect the overall diversity and quality of your backlink profile. If your website has lots of referring domains, this indicates to Google that your site has received backlinks from a wide range of sources, which strengthens its authority. Having a diverse range of referring domains also suggests that your website’s content is relevant and useful to a broad audience. With Google, it works the same way. Whenever your website gets an endorsement (in the form of a backlink) from a new domain, Google appreciates it. When the same domain endorses you again, Google still appreciates it, but the value of that second show of support pales in comparison to that of a new domain “recommending” your website. So, while getting the tenth link from the same website won’t get you into hot water, it won’t benefit your website as much either. If your website has a low number of referring domains, it will be seen as less trustworthy and will struggle to rank well in search results. Similarly, if your site receives backlinks from low-quality or spammy domains, this can harm its reputation and can even result in a penalty from search engines. This is one major reason why you need to pay attention to the referring domain metric, which shows the true value of your backlink profile. Many SEO professionals analyze their referring domains to identify areas for improvement in their backlink profiles. You can use what you learned from your current backlink profile to take the necessary steps in increasing the number of high-quality referring domains to your site.
