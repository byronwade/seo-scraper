What is your approach to conducting a technical SEO audit? The interviewer will likely use this question to evaluate your technical and analytical skills in SEO. Your answer might differ depending on the tools and techniques you prefer to use. Here’s what your response might look like: Possible answer: First, I typically run an audit using website audit tools like SE Ranking. These tools are great for checking the site’s overall health, and seeing if it is experiencing any new issues, such as broken links, issues with meta tags and localization, etc. These tools also help me discover which site areas to dive deeper into. Then, I look into those key site areas while incorporating data from GSC. The Pages report is especially useful for identifying indexing issues, while the Experience report is great for assessing CWV performance. Next, I gather all of my findings and categorize them by their priority level. Based on this data, I create an action plan (e.g., to improve the title & meta description) or pass it on to the development team (e.g., to fix hreflang misconfiguration). 2. How do you perform competitor research? This question gauges your skillfulness in identifying a website’s competitors and their SEO strategies. It also tests your ability to use these insights to improve your site’s performance. Your answer to this question can vary depending on the tools you prefer to use. Possible answer: To get the best possible competitor insights, I use competitive research tools like SE Ranking. These tools help me identify the direct and partial competitors of websites. I also use these tools to find out which sites perform best and which ones are closest to my domain in terms of the current state. They also help me identify which pages (keyword clusters) drive organic traffic. I also analyze competitors’ website structure and primary design features and collect insights revolving around their off-page strategy, among other aspects. Finally, I use the most successful cases (which are also the most realistic) and all the collected data for my own SEO strategy. 3. What steps do you take to perform keyword research? There are many valid approaches to keyword research. Please feel free to describe which one appeals most to you. When answering this SEO interview question, your main task is to convince the interviewer that you understand the ins and outs of this process and that your proficiency in it extends beyond the tools/practices you prefer. Possible answer: I use a two-step approach to conducting keyword research. First, I compile a list of seed keywords and then expand it using tools like Keyword Planner, SE Ranking, or other keyword research tools. I also use GSC query data for on-page optimization. After that, I conduct competitor research to identify their top-performing pages and keywords, then incorporate these insights into my own site. In addition, I use Google Trends to identify trending topics in the industry. 4. How do you conduct a content audit? Thorough content audits provide valuable insights into your content, including which content performs best and which falls short of expected results. This question helps interviewers assess your ability to review existing content, identify content gaps, and make data-backed improvements to your content strategy. Possible answer: When performing a content audit, I first set clear goals and select the right metrics. Then, I consolidate all relevant URLs into a single spreadsheet and categorize the content by parameter type (e.g., content type, date, word count, etc). Using analytics tools, I fill out the table with the necessary values. Finally, I create an action plan for each piece of content based on the data collected. 5. How do you implement internal linking strategies? Interviewers ask this question to evaluate your approach to complex tasks like internal linking analysis and optimizing website structure to prioritize essential pages. Possible answer: I follow a step-by-step process when optimizing a website’s internal linking structure. I begin by crawling it to review its overall structure and click depth. I also analyze its current internal linking structure, identify its most linked-to pages, and check for possible orphan pages. In the meantime, I compile a list of priority pages and assign relevant keywords to each. Then, I figure out how to ensure that my top pages have the most links. For instance, I may link to them from the header and footer menus. I also incorporate anchor texts into my internal linking plan, spreading them logically throughout my content. Finally, I consolidate all this information into a single document and then collaborate with the content or development team (depending on the company’s workflow) to implement the optimization plan. 6. How do you approach E-E-A-T? This question is used to evaluate your understanding of the meaning behind E-E-A-T and if you know how to optimize content for it. Possible answer: Since E-E-A-T stands for experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness, I always try to ensure that the content produced aligns with the following practices: The content is unique, high in quality, and written for people first. The content is created and/or reviewed by an expert with relevant expertise/experience in the field (and it’s outlined on the website via the bio description). All claims made in the content are supported by evidence. The website has an About Us page and author bios containing all essential information, among other expert signals. All content on external websites written by our experts contains a bio and social media links. 7. How do you measure SEO results? Measuring SEO results and making adjustments based on collected data is key regardless of your skill level. This question gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to do so: Possible answer: To track SEO results, I first decide on the best SEO metrics based on set business goals. Then, I choose the most suitable tools to track highly specific results with (e.g., GA4 for user engagement and all traffic channels, and GSC combined with Rank Tracker for SEO performance). Finally, I set up my monitoring and reporting routine (daily, weekly, monthly) to monitor progress over time. SEO reporting tools allow me to automate the reporting process and use various customization options. 8. What was one of your most successful SEO campaigns? This question helps interviewers understand how much practical experience you have in SEO and the results you can produce. Of course, the answer to this question should be unique to the individual and the job’s requirements. But here’s a response that you can use as an example: Possible answer: Last year, I was hired by an online education company aiming to increase organic traffic and, consequently, leads. Within 12 months of my work there, I increased organic traffic by 350% (from 10,000 to 45,000 monthly visits), and qualified leads by 210% (from 300 to 930). I used a research-based content strategy, incorporated on-page optimization, and used a targeted off-page strategy to achieve these goals. Also, I collaborated with the content, design, and development teams to improve the site’s content quality and UX. We also fixed the site’s primary technical SEO issues together. 9. Which SEO tools do you regularly use? SEO doesn’t work without good data and analytics. Skilled SEO specialists must use various SEO tools: Possible answer: I combine tools like GSC, GA4, and Bing Webmaster Tools with reliable third-party SEO platforms. I tend to use some variation of these SEO tools with SEO add-ons. I also use general-purpose tools for my SEO tasks, including Google Sheets, ChatGPT, Miro, Figma, etc. Besides, I use Clarity and other tools like it to analyze user-site interactions. 10. What tasks do you use ChatGPT for? When used properly, ChatGPT is great for simplifying certain SEO activities. This SEO interview question helps the interviewer gauge your familiarity with AI technologies and how you incorporate them into your standalone vision and expertise. Possible answer: I typically use ChatGPT to get ideas, seek help with specific technical tasks, or generate small pieces of content. It’s great for brainstorming content ideas, assisting with outlines, generating structured data, or helping with Google Sheets formulas. It can also generate meta descriptions, FAQs, or other content elements. I have even used ChatGPT to construct emails for a digital PR campaign. 11. How can combining SEO and PPC help you get better results? Possible answer: First, optimizing a webpage for a specific keyword in organic search and investing in PPC advertising for the same keyword can improve your chances of getting more valuable clicks. Second, with PPC, you can “test” new keyword clusters to decide if they are worth optimizing for organically. Also, you can use keyword data from Google Ads campaigns to optimize for SEO (e.g., you can learn which keywords attract paid traffic and which keywords have the highest conversion rate). Finally, PPC can enhance remarketing efforts by targeting users who have already interacted with your website organically. This significantly increases conversion opportunities. 12. What is the relationship between SEO and SEM? Possible answer: While SEO is used to target organic traffic, SEM focuses both on organic and paid online advertising. Essentially, SEO is only one component of your SEM strategy. The choice of the best marketing strategy will depend on many different factors. SEO provides you with long-term benefits, while PPC is good for new websites or experimental clusters. SEO is also a good way to educate your audience, while PPC helps to get clients faster. Finally, to rank for the most important (or competitive) keywords, I combine SEO and SEM. 13. Core Web Vitals: What’s the difference between real user metrics and lab data? Possible answer: The difference between real user metrics (RUM) and lab data stems from how they are gathered and used. RUM reflects real-world user experiences, while lab data is collected through simulated user interactions in controlled test environments (such as specific internet speeds or smartphone models). One way to integrate these datasets is to monitor RUM data for real performance issues and then use lab data to diagnose problems and confirm solutions. RUM data can be accessed within GSC, whereas lab data is available through PageSpeed Insights. 14. Do nofollow links influence rankings? Given that the impact of nofollow links on rankings is a nuanced subject, the interviewer may want to know your opinion on it. Possible answer: Today, the consensus is that nofollow links don’t impact keyword rankings directly, but affect the online performance of websites indirectly. For instance, nofollow links from relevant high-authority websites can drive referral traffic to your website. This helps you increase brand awareness and get more organic traffic for it in the future. 15. What are the three main ways to add schema markup? Which one do you prefer? It’s important to be highly specific when answering technical SEO interview questions. Mention all three schema markup methods and explain why you use a specific one Possible answer: You can add schema markup through JSON-LD, microdata, or RDFa. I prefer JSON-LD due to its maintainability and search engine preference. 16. What are some common SEO mistakes that people make? While it’s impossible to list all SEO-related mistakes, you should be able to describe the most common ones. Possible answer: Here are some of the most common SEO mistakes I’ve encountered: Poor internal linking structure Targeting unrealistically competitive keywords Ignoring search intent Creating content without decent keyword research and SERP analysis 17. Is there a bounce rate in GA4? This question is meant to determine if you understand the difference between UA and GA4 in terms of their core metrics. Possible answer: Yes, there is a bounce rate in GA4, although it’s calculated differently from UA. The bounce rate represents the percentage of sessions where there was little to no engagement. This includes sessions that lasted less than 10 seconds, had no events triggered, or had fewer than 2 pageviews or screenviews. 18. What are the most common canonical issues? Mention at least 3-5 issues you’ve encountered throughout your professional experience.: Possible answer: The most common canonical issues include the following: Creating canonical chains Pointing to a supposed canonical URL that returns a status code other than 200 Adding non-canonical pages to the sitemap.xml Pointing internal links to non-canonicalized URLs Using hreflang instead of canonical Using the “noindex” tag or blocking it in the robots.txt file, plus using the canonical tag on the same page 19. What are the main user behavior metrics? Since this question doesn’t specify whether these metrics should be related to SEO, provide an extended list of at least 8-10 general user behavior metrics. Possible answer: I typically divide user behavior metrics into the following groups: engagement (session duration, bounce or engagement rate, triggering events, etc), acquisition and activation (signups, activation rate), retention (retention rate, churn rate), conversion (conversion rate). I also look at other important metrics like CTR, funnel drop-off rate, etc. 20. What types of backlinks do you recommend getting? And which ones are not worth your time? Provide specific examples for both cases. The interviewer is testing you to see if you know which backlinks contribute to SEO and which can harm it. Possible answer: The best backlinks are organic ones. This is because Google prioritizes shareable content and useful resources. Running a PR campaign or contributing to relevant websites are healthy ways to get backlinks. If I had a local business, I would add it to local listings. Potentially harmful backlinks include links from low-quality directories, paid low-quality guest posts, irrelevant links, and comment spam. 21. Do you have experience running a digital PR campaign? If you have relevant experience, describe your role and the goals you achieved. Possible answer: Yes, I have experience running a digital PR campaign. In one project, I collaborated with the PR team to create and distribute a study done by our team. I also established relationships with influencers to get brand mentions and build high-quality backlinks. This approach not only generated brand awareness but also positively impacted our search engine rankings. 22. What are toxic backlinks? Possible answer: Toxic backlinks are low-quality or manipulative backlinks that either negatively impact your visibility and rankings or have the potential to do so. 23. What are topic clusters? Possible answer: A topic cluster is a group of web pages with related subtopics. They are all linked to the primary topic (pillar page). 24. Is the meta description a ranking factor? Possible answer: No, it’s not. At the same time, a good meta description can boost CTR and drive more organic traffic to your page. 25. What are the latest Google updates and their impact? Choose 2 to 4 of Google’s latest updates and briefly describe their SEO impact. Possible answer: As of March 2024, Google’s latest updates include the March 2024 Core & Spam Updates, the November 2023 Review Update, the November 2023 Broad Core Update, and the September 2023 Helpful Content Update. The September 2023 Helpful Content Update was one of the most significant updates. It aimed to improve content quality in search and boost website trust factors. After this update’s release, SEOs took E-E-A-T and positive user experience more seriously. The majority of websites affected by the update still haven’t recovered from its impact. 26. How do you stay current with the latest trends and updates in SEO? The interviewer will use this question to determine if you are using credible and up-to-date resources to keep track of the latest industry news and trends. Possible answer: I check SEO news from a range of sources, including Google’s official channels and reputable SEO blogs/industry publications like Search Engine Journal, Search Engine Land, Search Engine Roundtable, and the SE Ranking blog. Plus, I regularly attend SEO webinars and read SEO experts’ posts on Linkedin or Twitter. 27. How do you see SEO changing in the near future? The interviewer may use this question to gauge your ability to think critically and predict trends based on the latest SEO developments. Possible answer: AI is already impacting SEO, although I believe that its impact will be even more significant in the future. As SEO specialists, we will be able to automate more tasks and focus more on strategic ones. Plus, AI will dramatically impact SERP results when Google rolls out SGE. 28. What are your predictions for SGE? Possible answer: I think SGE will impact all websites and niches. It will impact the traffic share, and many users will find answers directly in SERPs. This could result in a huge drop in organic traffic for many sites. I also believe that informational queries will be affected the most. So, websites will have to rethink their organic strategy, focus on building their brand, and adapt to these changes in search behavior. 29. What is the most important recent SEO news? Describe 2 to 3 of the latest events in SEO to demonstrate your ability to stay up-to-date. Possible answer: A lot of things happened in SEO recently! What I find most interesting is that (1) Google rebranded Bard as Gemini, (2) Google introduced AI in Maps to suggest personalized local business recommendations, (3) and Reddit gave Google access to its AI training data as part of their new partnership. 30. What are some popular SEO myths? Mention some of the most common myths you’ve heard during your experience as an SEO specialist. Possible answer: First, some people still believe that keyword stuffing improves rankings. Some people also still believe that longer content always performs better. What’s more, there’s a myth that Google uses metrics like DA or DT when ranking webpages on SERPs. 31. What are some SEO practices to avoid? This question helps the interviewer assess your knowledge of ethical SEO practices, and to ensure you wouldn’t try to pull harmful SEO tricks when working with them. Possible answer: I’d recommend avoiding SEO practices like: Writing for search engines first. Using keyword stuffing. Generating content without human oversight/editing. Buying backlinks. 32. Do you use Bing Webmaster Tools? How is it different from GSC? Answering this question is a great way to demonstrate to the interviewer that you have a diverse professional background in SEO. Possible answer: Yes, I do use Bing Webmaster Tools. These tools have pretty similar features to GSC, especially when it comes to displaying organic performance. The major difference is that GSC has user experience reports and rich results data. Bing Webmaster Tools provides some unique insights that GSC doesn’t have, including site scan, keyword research, or backlink gap analysis. 33. What are some use cases for canonicals and redirects? When answering this question, provide at least 2 to 3 use cases for canonicals and redirects. Possible answer: It’s best to use redirects when: You’re migrating a website or merging two different sites. Your website can be accessed using several URLs. You want to redirect users from a removed page to a new one. Canonicals, on the other hand, are great for: Pages with UTM parameters. Products residing in multiple categories. Faceted navigation and other dynamic URLs. 34. What are some key ways to incorporate JavaScript into SEO? Provide a list of Javascript-centered SEO best practices that you’d recommend. Possible answer: Here are the best Javascript SEO practices: Ensure Google can crawl and index all of your content. Follow best on-page practices. Use proper <a href> links and implement pagination correctly. Use meaningful HTTP status codes. Avoid blocking important JavaScript files in your robots.txt file. Use server-side or static rendering. 35. How do you get organic keyword data in GA4? This is an intermediate-level SEO interview question. It helps the interviewer assess your knowledge of GA4 and GSC. Possible answer: This data is not available in GA4 by default, but I can access it by connecting GSC to my GA4 account. I also get access to current (and precise) keyword data through rank tracking tools. 36. How does UX affect SEO? Possible answer: There’s a strong relationship between UX and SEO. Now more than ever, you should focus on real users, not on Google. You can outperform your competitors by providing an exceptional user experience, creating engaging content, and making your site interactive. 37. Do you have experience with Looker Studio? If you’ve used Looker Studio, explain how you have incorporated it into your work. If not, simply state that you haven’t needed to use it yet. Possible answer: Yes, I have experience using Looker Studio. At my previous marketing agency, I used Looker Studio to create data visualization dashboards, both for myself and for my manager. I also used it to create data-rich reports for clients. I mainly used insights from data sources like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to gauge the site’s organic performance, user engagement data, and conversion metrics. This ensured that the marketing agency I worked for could optimize remote work while still keeping clients fully informed about our SEO progress. Advanced SEO interview questions for middle to senior roles For this role, you’re expected to be a self-directed specialist. You should be capable of leading projects on your own, assuming full accountability for their success, and adeptly handling diverse challenges. When answering the interviewer’s questions, show off your analytical expertise by outlining how you craft and implement data-driven solutions to enhance search rankings and boost website traffic. 38. What does your step-by-step process look like when creating an SEO strategy? Possible answer: If it’s an existing website, I’d begin by collecting data on its current health and performance. Then, I’d perform comprehensive research on the market, target audience, and competitors. Next, I’d perform a SERP analysis and conduct keyword research to identify search intent and target keywords. The competitive research data I find would assist me in building an SEO plan for website clusters and pages. I’d also run a site-wide technical audit and an on-page audit of the site’s main pages. I’d use this information to create a comprehensive plan over a quarter year, half year and beyond. During this process, I’d continuously fine-tune my SEO strategy according to the main business metrics. 39. How would you build a strategy for a new site (1-6 months)? Possible answer: I’d start with competitive research. Then, I’d decide how to format the website’s overall structure & topic clusters. After that, I’d create a content plan based on keyword research data and competitors’ pages that generate the most (relevant) traffic. For a new website, my approach would involve targeting achievable keywords with lower competition levels. I’d also run a digital PR campaign to secure mentions and backlinks. 40. What actions would you take if the website you’re working on fails to demonstrate satisfactory performance after six months? Describe the action plan you would follow in response to poor website performance. Pay special attention to the fact that the interviewer wants to know what you would do six months after initiating your SEO strategy. Possible answer: If it’s a new website, it could be fine. Considering today’s level of competitiveness in SERPs, it’s normal for new domains to struggle, and it’s rare for them to rank high. Even if it were an older website, and if it hasn’t seen significant improvement over six months, the situation could still change after the next Google update. However, I would adjust my current strategy in the following ways if I determined that these variables were not a factor: Crawl the website to identify critical technical SEO issues. Do competitor research and SERP analysis for my main keyword clusters to see if the search intent and content type remain the same. Re-evaluate keyword targeting. Do a content audit and check if I need to update, consolidate, or redirect the pages. Audit the site’s internal linking structure. Audit each backlink’s quality and relevance, and update my backlink strategy using dedicated link-building tools. Ensure the site aligns with E-E-A-T. Review user experience metrics to ensure the site is user-friendly, engaging, and provides value to the audience. 41. How do you calculate organic visibility? Answer this question by demonstrating how well you understand this metric and what impacts it. Possible answer: Organic visibility can be calculated in several different ways. The most common way is to multiply the search volume of the keywords you rank for by your current position. Here is the formula: Organic visibility = keyword search volume * Average CTR for the keywords you rank for. I also use tools like SE Ranking to get this info. 42. How do you calculate traffic forecast? The question is similar to the previous one. There are multiple ways to calculate traffic forecasts, so you should at least present the main ones. Possible answer: I use the following formula, which is the most popular method for calculating traffic forecast: Estimated monthly traffic = Total keyword search volume * Average CTR for the website’s desired ranking position. I also use statistical methods. For example, I import my GSC historical data into Excel and apply the corresponding forecasting formulas (there are many ready-made SEO forecast templates with pre-arranged formulas available online). Alternatively, to automate this process, I use SEO forecasting tools that provide an estimate of the available traffic. 43. Does CTR impact rankings? Answer this question focusing on official Google statements in the first place. Possible answer: CTR isn’t known traditionally for being a direct ranking factor. Even so, Google has shared publicly that it uses click data from SERPs for training, evaluation, controlled experiments, and personalization. This means that even though CTR itself doesn’t directly boost your rankings, having consistently high CTRs on your content sends positive signals to search engines about your content’s overall relevance and quality These positive signals can contribute to a gradual improvement in rankings for your targeted keywords. 44. How do you measure the impact of backlinks on your rankings? The interviewer will most likely use this question to assess both your analytical skills and overall thought process on this issue. Possible answer: I typically analyze the shifts in ranking positions of my targeted keywords. I also analyze money anchor texts and compare them with my target keywords. An increase in rankings over time can indicate that the backlinks I’m receiving are having a positive impact. It generally takes about 2 to 3 months or more to see initial results. 45. How would you check domains in bulk? For this question, specify the tools you use when performing a bulk domain analysis. Possible answer: I either use a range of SEO platforms or APIs. I learned that if there are a ton of domains to analyze (let’s say, over 200), using APIs is the most effective. I often use SE Ranking’s API to get metrics like organic traffic, keyword count, domain trust score, referring domains, backlinks, and more. 46. How do you scrape Google SERP data for multiple keywords simultaneously? This question is essentially asking you to demonstrate the methods you use to automate your SERP analysis. For example, what tools do you use to retrieve multiple search results (URLs) efficiently (and for hundreds or even thousands of keywords)? You may also be asked to get 100 SERP results for 1,000 keywords. Possible answer: Some people use Python or other custom tools for this purpose, but I prefer to do it the easy way. I use SE Ranking’s SERP Competitors module. It lets me specify the desired keyword group, choose how many results from the SERP I need (100/50/30/20/10), and then get a list of domains or URLs ranking in the top 10-100 for the keywords I’m targeting. Then, I organize this list in Google Sheets and add all essential data. 47. Tell us about some SEO experiments that you think would be worth running. Provide a list of SEO experiments that account for current trends in the industry. Also, make sure they are relevant to your professional background. Possible answer: Here’s a list of SEO experiments that I’d recommend running: Adding new content elements like comparison tables or pros & cons blocks. Adding customer reviews and other trust factors to landing pages. Adding expert quotes to blog articles. Testing keywords in meta descriptions. Schema tests, etc. 48. How do you work with developers to execute your SEO suggestions? Your approach to cooperating with developers might vary depending on your professional background. Possible answer: Following a website audit, I create a backlog of issues that need to be addressed. I then prioritize them based on their urgency and significance for SEO & business. Each issue is accompanied by a description of the fixes needed, the desired outcome, the context, and its importance. If an issue is complex, I break it down into smaller tasks. Also, I schedule calls when necessary to discuss these tasks with other teams. I always welcome input from the development team, as they offer valuable insights and solutions. 49. What could happen if canonical tags get mixed with noindex tags? The point of this question is to gauge your understanding of technical SEO. Possible answer: This causes Google to receive conflicting signals. In fact, a self-referencing canonical tag signals to search bots that a specific webpage is important and should be indexed. Conversely, a noindex tag on the same page indicates the opposite. It advises search bots to exclude the page from search results. Given that the meta robots tag is a stronger signal, Google is unlikely to index this page. This results in your canonical tag being ignored. 50. Have you explored any alternative SEO channels (e.g. Tiktok)? If you have relevant experience, share your goals and the results you have achieved through these channels. If you don’t have direct experience with any alternative SEO channels, this is fine. Just show your basic knowledge of them and how to use them. Possible answer: I previously ran a TikTok SEO company for an educational app for kids. More specifically, I developed educational video content and optimized it with relevant captions and hashtags. I also incorporated trendy sounds and effects. Within three months of regular posting, we managed to achieve a 300% increase in organic traffic and a 25% jump in app downloads. We also achieved top 3 rankings for several educational app-related hashtags. 51. How do you conduct keyword research for YouTube? Share your experience with performing keyword research for Google. Possible answer: I start by using YouTube Autocomplete, analyzing competitors’ video titles/descriptions, and examining the video’s tags. Moreover, since search volume on Google might mirror that on YouTube for the same keywords, I adapt Google keyword data for YouTube. I also explore other dedicated tools that provide search volume data tailored to YouTube searches. 52. How would you use PPC data for SEO? The interviewer might ask this question to gauge your ability to leverage data from different sources. SEO specialists often don’t have direct access to PPC data, but understanding how it complements SEO efforts demonstrates your ability to take a well-rounded approach. Possible answer: Google Ads provides the most valuable PPC insights. Having access to this data could help me identify keywords that drive paid traffic and boast the highest conversion rate. I could also use Google Ads to test new keyword clusters or page layouts in terms of conversions. Finally, I could use Keyword Planner for keyword research. Basic SEO interview questions for junior positions In this section, we’ll explore foundational SEO questions and continue the trend of providing example responses. Remember, these questions can be applied to any SEO concept. 53. How can you tell if a website is indexed by Google? There are two main options. The first is to go to GSC → URL Inspection Tool to check the indexing status of each page. The second option is to type site: followed by the website’s domain name (e.g., site:yourdomain.com). Although the latter option is not the most precise, it can still be useful for analysis. Another option is to paste a piece of your page’s content into the search engine and see if the corresponding URL appears in the SERP. 54. What is the Google Knowledge Graph? The Google Knowledge Graph is a database containing billions of facts. Google uses this database to provide immediate and factual information to users. It connects data from different public sources and content creators, analyzes it, and then presents these findings in an accessible way. 55. What are rich snippets? Rich snippets are enhanced Google search results that display additional information, such as ratings, how-tos, recipe elements, etc. In ecommerce SEO, rich results show details like prices and return policies. 56. What is the difference between organic and paid results? Organic results are unpaid listings that appear in search engine results based on several factors. Paid results, however, are advertisements that appear at the very top or bottom of SERPs, marked with a “Sponsored” tag, and are paid for by advertisers. 57. What is a long-tail keyword? Long-tail keywords are longer, more specific search queries that typically include three words or more. They usually have low search volumes and are less competitive than short-tail keywords. 58. What is robots.txt? Robots.txt is a file used by website owners or SEOs to direct search bots on which pages or sections of a website should and should not be crawled. It’s important to note that these instructions pertain to crawling, not indexing. For indexing instructions, use robots meta tags. 59. What is a robots meta tag? The robots meta tag is an HTML tag placed within the <head> section of a page, providing directives to search bots regarding which pages they can or cannot index. It’s probably the strongest directive for search bots. 60. What are anchor texts? Anchor text refers to the clickable text within a hyperlink, which offers context about the link’s destination. It assists users in understanding the content they’ll access upon clicking. What’s more, anchor text helps the crawler determine the link’s relevance, potentially impacting website rankings. 61. What is an XML sitemap? The XML sitemap is a file that contains a list of all your website’s pages. Google uses it to find your website’s URLs and crawl them. 62. What method do you use to redirect a page? There are 3 ways to redirect a web page: HTTP redirects (most common), HTML redirects, and JavaScript redirects. I typically use a WordPress plugin to set up redirects. This automates and simplifies the redirecting process for me. 63. What is the difference between dofollow and nofollow links? How are they used? Dofollow (or just follow links) pass link juice and authority, while nofollow links do not. Nofollow links are typically used for unverified sources you link out to, signaling Google to ignore the link. 64. What is the difference between on-page and off-page SEO? On-page SEO optimizes elements on the page itself (content, URL structure, internal linking, title and meta description, page experience factors, etc). Off-page SEO builds website credibility and authority externally (e.g., by getting backlinks). Both improve rankings but off-page SEO increases brand awareness and/or referral traffic. 65. What is crawling, and how do you increase your crawl budget? Crawling is when search bots discover new and updated URLs on the web. Google decides how often to crawl websites based on factors like size, update frequency, page quality, and relevance compared to other websites. Each website has a crawl budget based on its crawl capacity and demand. The most effective way to increase your crawl budget is to increase your crawl serving capacity and focus on creating valuable content that resonates with searchers. You can also use the URL Inspection tool in GSC to request that Google crawl individual URLs. 66. What are some other digital marketing channels besides SEO? Social media marketing (SMM), email marketing, and paid advertising (including Google or Bing Ads, influencer marketing, etc). 67. What is domain authority? Domain authority is a metric developed by third-party SEO tools to evaluate a domain’s ability to compete with other websites. It is typically calculated based on a website’s backlink profile and ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating stronger authority. While not used by Google, this metric is useful for comparing websites’ ranking potential. 68. What is the difference between a 301 and a 302 redirect? The 301 redirect is used to permanently forward traffic from one URL to another, while the 302 redirect indicates only a temporary redirection. 69. What types of SEO keywords do you know? SEO keywords can be classified into different groups. I use a length-based approach to categorize keywords into the following three types: short-tail, medium-tail, and long-tail. When it comes to search intent, there are informational, navigational, commercial, transactional, and local keywords. Plus, there are LSI keywords, question-based keywords, trendy keywords, and evergreen keywords. 70. What is NAP in SEO? In SEO, NAP refers to Name, Address, and Phone Number. This data should be consistent across all channels, including the website, GMB, and other local listings. Ranking well in local organic search results is especially crucial. 71. Can social media marketing assist with SEO? While social media marketing does not directly impact SEO, it can still play a role in your overall SEO strategy. For example, leveraging social media can drive traffic to your website and improve brand visibility. Plus, sharing content on social media platforms boosts content performance and potentially leads to earning backlinks. Essential SEO interview questions to assess soft skills 72. Which tasks do you find more/less enjoyable? When answering this SEO interview question, focus more on the tasks you enjoy. Try not to mention more than two of your least favorite tasks. Focusing on the negative can have a negative impression on your interviewer. Possible answer: I enjoy performing competitor and keyword research, optimizing content, and identifying and resolving technical website issues. Some routine tasks, like manual reporting, are less enjoyable for me. 73. How do you prioritize tasks if you have a lot at once? Use specific examples from your professional experience. Possible answer: I address the most urgent and critical issues first (e.g., dealing with 404 issues). After that, I prioritize high-impact efforts (e.g., optimizing high-traffic pages) and time-sensitive campaigns. 74. What would you do if someone on your team made a mistake but you were responsible for it? This is a tricky question. It is aimed at assessing your ability to handle out-of-hand situations. The best answer involves taking a proactive and accountable approach. Possible answer: I’d accept the responsibility. I’d also develop an action plan to address the problem. If possible, I’d implement immediate fixes. To ensure similar mistakes don’t happen again, I’d try to determine the cause of the mistake and discuss it with the other party. I’d also encourage them to contact me whenever they have any questions. 75. If you know someone is likely to complete a task at a “so-so” quality, would you delegate it to them or do it yourself? This SEO interview question is aimed at evaluating your ability to take responsibility and make tough decisions. Consider two perspectives: when the task is critical and when it’s not. Possible answer: If the task was critical, time-sensitive, or required high expertise, I’d handle it on my own. With less critical tasks, I’d consider delegating them to someone else, but I’d provide clear instructions for handling them. 76. Do you find it fulfilling to educate others? Be transparent when sharing your thoughts on this topic. If possible, provide relevant examples from your professional experience. Possible answer: At my last company, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with junior SEO specialist during their onboarding period. They not only passed it but eventually grew into skilled SEO professionals. I’d be happy to take on this responsibility again, especially since I believe transparent communication and collaboration are key. 77. What would you do if you didn’t agree with your manager? Express your ideas clearly and respectfully. The interviewer is using this question to gauge your ability to communicate constructively. Possible answer: I would approach this situation by communicating openly and with a solution-oriented mindset. I’d choose an appropriate time and setting for a private conversation to express my concerns, supporting them with clear evidence or arguments. Ideally, my goal would be to reach compromises or find middle-ground solutions with my manager. 78. How do you see your future career? This question will help the interviewer evaluate your future plans within the company, allowing them to determine if your vision aligns with theirs. Possible answer: I am constantly improving my knowledge and skills as an SEO specialist, performing better each day. I have plans to become an SEO manager who can create and execute comprehensive SEO strategies and manage the entire team. 79. How do you communicate with “difficult” clients? This scenario is common among agency environments. Make sure your approach to dealing with demanding, frustrated, or simply “difficult” clients reflects your assertiveness and high-level skills. Possible answer: When working with “difficult” clients, I use three main approaches: active listening, clear communication, and a solution-oriented mindset. Through active listening, I offer clients the opportunity to express their opinions fully. Clear communication allows me to build transparent relationships with clients, setting realistic expectations regarding the issues discussed. Finally, having a solution-oriented mindset enables me to find compromises that satisfy both parties. If we can’t reach a compromise, I’d involve a higher authority or supervisor.
