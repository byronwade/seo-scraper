What’s more, the platform allows data from various SE Ranking tools to be combined into a single comprehensive report, such as website audit results with traffic data. Cons Data Explanation: Although SE Ranking is praised for its ease of use and has a generous learning curve, some users believe that specific data could be better explained in terms of how it is generated or calculated.

Website Audit Limits: Depending on your plan, there may be limits on the number of website audits you can perform. SEO agencies that need to conduct multiple audits may also need to upgrade to a higher plan. Pricing SE Ranking offers three main subscription plans.

For example, you can run a detailed analysis on one domain or check bulk URLs from multiple domains, generating numerous reports for each mode. Custom Settings: The tool lets you tailor its functionality to your specific needs, allowing you to include or exclude certain elements. This makes for a highly personalized auditing experience. Google Analytics & Search Console Integration: Screaming Frog can integrate with the APIs of Google Analytics, Search Console, and PageSpeed Insights.

Precise Custom Search & Data Extraction: Screaming Frog allows you to perform custom searches and data extraction from a webpage’s HTML, offering a deeply personalized data-gathering experience.

Other Features: Screaming Frog offers a range of advanced audit features. For example, it can render web pages using the integrated Chromium WRS to crawl dynamic, JavaScript-rich websites and frameworks. Pros: Comprehensive Crawling: Screaming Frog’s SEO Spider tool is known for its ability to crawl websites, much like how Google does it. It typically uncovers more website URLs than other audit tools. This ensures that it highlights potential issues that can stop search engines from discovering or attributing value to a site. As one user mentioned, it “lays out all the issues clearly and allows you to export them for further analysis.” Detailed Analysis: The tool deeply analyzes technical and fundamental on-page issues. Users appreciate its precision and enjoy being able to export issues for further analysis. It’s perfect for technically inclined people and for techies who like to combine coding with SEO. Advanced Features: The tool boasts advanced search and extraction features, making it highly useful for site scraping and data extraction. It also offers excellent API access to tools frequently used by SEO professionals. Free Version: The free version of Screaming Frog is very functional and often sufficient for crawling small websites. Cons: Outdated Interface: Some users have noted that the interface is dated and not as intuitive as they would like it to be. It may take an excess of time and effort to learn where to find different views and data. Crawl Speed: The maximum crawl speed is limited to 20 URLs per second, which some users find too slow and wish to see increased. No Health Score: The tool lacks a health score feature that would allow users to quickly estimate a site’s overall health or progress. This is a valuable metric that can be found in other auditing tools. Lack of White Label Reporting: Users would appreciate a white label reporting option to present professional reports to clients, instead of having to create their own reports using crawl data. Technical Complexity: The amount of information provided by Screaming Frog can be overwhelming for new users, especially at the beginning. Moreover, its high degree of technical complexity may demand tons of time and resources to fully understand and utilize all of its features. Reconnecting Accounts: Users reported that the tool doesn’t save connected accounts, requiring users to reconnect their Google Analytics, Ahrefs, PageSpeed Insights, and Google Search Console accounts each time they open the app. Pricing: Screaming Frog’s SEO Spider tool comes in both free and paid versions. The free version let you crawl up to 500 URLs per website, making it great for small websites or for trying out the tool. However, it lacks advanced features like JavaScript rendering, custom extraction, Google Analytics integration, and more. The paid version costs $259 per year for users requiring more extensive capabilities. It enables unlimited crawling and full access to the tool’s advanced features. Additionally, it allows users to save crawls and customize the tool to their specific needs. Unlike most site audit tools, Screaming Frog does not offer a monthly payment option, which may or may not be a deciding factor for some users when considering a subscription. Verdict Screaming Frog’s SEO Spider tool is a robust and flexible website crawler used by SEO professionals worldwide. It can efficiently crawl websites of all sizes and provides crucial onsite data for SEO strategies. Its API integration with Google Analytics, Search Console, and PageSpeed Insights provides a comprehensive user and performance data analysis. At the same time, its unique site visualization features and scheduling capabilities add to its appeal. However, it has an older interface that can be challenging to navigate for newcomers, and its technical complexity may require a significant learning curve. Due to its advanced nature, Screaming Frog is often used for in-depth audits that are not needed on a regular basis. While many SEO professionals rely on Screaming Frog for detailed or task-oriented checks, they might prefer a simpler solution like SE Ranking for regular, quick audits. All that being said, the tool’s comprehensive crawling capabilities, detailed analysis, advanced features, and its functional free version would make it a valuable asset in your SEO toolbox. 3.

No Free Trial: Despite providing a variety of free tools, Ahrefs does not offer a free trial version for its paid subscription toolset. Confusing Pricing Model: Ahrefs’ pricing model may be seen as misleading by some users, and for larger projects, it can turn out to be a costly tool. High Pricing: If you’re considering buying the paid version, it’s important to note that Ahrefs is one of the more expensive tools out there. Pricing Ahrefs provides four distinct pricing plans, each offering unique features and catering to different needs.

Its detailed and actionable insights make it a valuable asset for any SEO professional. The tool’s user-friendly interface and in-depth reports are highly praised, but keep its steep learning curve (due to its extensive functionality) in mind before purchasing it. Now, Ahrefs does offer a free tool called Ahrefs Webmaster Tools, but for those who want to monitor their website’s SEO health, keep in mind that Ahrefs’ paid plans are among the highest on the market. This can be a problem for small businesses, who may be better off looking for the best Ahrefs alternative that fits into their budget. However, bigger companies may consider the cost to be justified. 6.

For instance, in addition to the site audit feature, it boasts one of the best keyword research tools. The availability of a free version is a substantial benefit, particularly for those embarking on their website auditing journey.
