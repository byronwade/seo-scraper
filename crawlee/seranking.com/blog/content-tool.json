Instead of “killing” creativity with SEO parameters, this tool helps generate interesting content ideas and enhances them with data. What does the Content Marketing Module do? SE Ranking’s Content Marketing Module speeds up and simplifies the content creation process at every stage—from generating content ideas to writing and optimizing texts. The module currently consists of two main tools: Content Editor and Content Idea Finder. Content Idea Finder analyzes the keyword you entered and clusters related terms around it. If you have a broad topic but aren’t sure what to write about, this tool will help you come up with ideas by showing: Terms that are semantically close to the keyword with the highest search volume in the cluster. Competitors’ titles that rank among the top ten in search results for the keyword with the highest search volume in the cluster. Keywords come with all the necessary SEO and PPC data. You can compare them by difficulty and search volume, then export them to Content Editor in one click. Content Editor lets you build SEO briefs, write optimized texts, and score content quality. This tool is supported by SE Ranking’s very own AI algorithm that analyzes top-ranking competitive content and presents 10 organic competitors paired with their Domain & Page Trust scores, the total number of referring domains, and word count. You can disable any competitors that you think are irrelevant to prevent them from impacting your text parameters. Based on competitive content, the tool suggests: Content parameters It will show you the recommended number of words/characters, headings, paragraphs, and images. You can change parameters if they don’t work for you, bind and unbind them in the brief, etc. Terms to use You’ll get a list of terms, including terms recommended by Google NLP. You can also add keywords manually. This tool shows all essential SEO data (search volume, keyword difficulty, density, recommended keyword count for your text, etc.) Content structure You can see the H1-H6’s that your competitors are using and choose the ones you like as a point of reference for your own content. You can also create your own headings from scratch and add them to the brief. Once you’ve created a brief that suits you, you can start writing an article (either directly in the editor or you can paste your text in and edit it). With the Share feature, you can invite colleagues or copywriters to work on the text with you in real time. Keep in mind that only you have the option to change the brief settings. Content Editor uses a score system to evaluate how optimized your text is. It also shows whether your text met the brief’s requirements. You can see in real-time how close you are to the ideal number of words, headings, paragraphs, and images. You can also track how many keywords you’ve already used and how many of them you still need to add. The built-in quality evaluator shows grammatical and punctuation errors that you need to correct. It also reveals stop words to avoid. The Outline tab shows the structure from your brief and your competitors’ content headings. If you have writer’s block, just paste a piece of your competitor’s content into the tool and use our AI rewrite feature. The tool can paraphrase up to 600 characters at a time and up to 2000 characters per article. Go to the demo account to test the tool yourself. It’s a fully functional account where you can see how each of the features described above works.
