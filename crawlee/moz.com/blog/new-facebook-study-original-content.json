By: Chad Wittman February 26, 2014 New Study Shows Original Content Reaches More People on Facebook Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Facebook continues to make significant changes in the news feed. This time Facebook has decreased the importance (technically the \"weight\") of status updates. With these changes occurring so rapidly in the news feed, many brand managers want to know how to stay on top of it all. We dug deep into the data to see what the latest change was and wanted to introduce a philosophy to stay ahead of the constant changes. We analyze and monitor this type of data for thousands of Facebook pages with a tool called EdgeRank Checker. On Jan. 21, Facebook released a blog post explaining that status updates from pages are less engaging than status updates from friends. In other words, status updates were going to lose exposure in the news feed. The change was implemented nearly immediately, as we saw organic reach begin to dip rapidly. In the graph below, you'll see a ~40% decrease from the two weeks after Jan. 21, as compared to the two weeks before: While frustrating for many brands, status updates aren't displayed nearly as often as links and photos, as they typically don't provide as much value to the business. Status updates are typically used for gathering general opinions or quick message updates, whereas links can drive actual traffic. During this change, the other content types were not significantly impacted. Most experienced a very moderate decrease, which is most likely due to normal fluctuations. Interestingly, videos have now become the strongest performer in the news feed. Our sample size for posts with videos is less than optimal, but our historical data shows a similar pattern. For brands that have the capability to deliver engaging videos, it should be considered as an interesting content outlet in the future. How does a brand stay ahead? As we study each change in the news feed, a common theme begins to appear. Content that creates value tends to bubble to the top. Google has a similar approach with search results. We see Facebook slowly becoming similar to Google in that capacity. When we examine the brands that are less impacted by negative changes, they tend to have strong engagement—specifically shares. Why is this? We think we can explain this phenomenon with a concept called Content Originator. Content Originator Brands that actually create the content (thus, Content Originators) are the ones that experience the most value in the news feed. We've seen Google take a similar approach with examining inbound links. Content Originators actually have less to do with Facebook specifically, as compared to the maturation of any social network. Twitter most likely experiences similar results, which you can see as a Tweet propagates across the world—the Content Originator gets more exposure. The reason that Content Originators are able to succeed with an onslaught of changes is that they are able to utilize natural distribution networks such as shares. While Facebook's algorithms may not weigh their initial post as heavily as before, strong engagement and shares are strong signals to distribute the content further. The news feed is filled with increasing competition that boasts larger and larger budgets to gain exposure within the feed. Being a Content Originator helps slice through the noise created by so many pages re-reporting news. The re-reporting of news is something that Facebook is attempting to decrease through these changes. It is also possible that brands will begin to gain additional exposure through the \"Trending\" section if they're the Content Originator of a new and trending topic. In an example below, you can see the local value that Facebook provides in the trending result. A story that was shared on Facebook 2,000+ times from CarolinaLive (not quite a Content Originator, but as close as you can get in a situation like this, as compared to a CNN-type news source) is given the extra exposure. The next object listed is from Fox Carolina News, again more of a Content Originator than the national brand of Fox News. The example above is meant to illustrate how Facebook perceives Content Originators elsewhere in their platform. We use things like this as clues to better understand how the news feed works. Conclusion Facebook decreased organic reach of status updates by ~40% on Jan. 21. For most brands, this doesn't have a large impact on their strategy, as they are mostly using links and photos to further increase their brand. Using a concept called Content Originator might help craft a content strategy that stays ahead of news feed changes. Facebook may be placing additional value on content originators in the news feed, and is surely valuing brands with strong engagement—especially ones with high share levels. Methodology We studied roughly 50,000 posts from 800 different pages for the two weeks before and after Jan. 21. For most metrics, we examined the median of each page's average performance over the time period analyzed. Engagement is defined as likes + comments + shares for this study. Copied! Back to Top",
