N By: Nuno Hipólito October 9, 2008 Just 'Cause I'm Nofollow Don't Mean I Ain't Got No Link Love to Give Link Building This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I apologize in advance for the bad grammar, but that's really how nofollow links talk, so it's not my fault. I'm just trying to \"keep it real.\" It ain't nothing but link love, baby I was looking at the stats of one of my blogs, and in the \"came from\" section of the report I saw a referral from another blog. I was curious so I clicked through to see if that blog had a link to mine. Turns out it was a comment I left... in 2006. Not much of a comment either, just a simple remark. But two years later that comment still brings in traffic, and qualified traffic at that, to my personal blog. Even back then I knew most comment systems were already using the nofollow tag, so no link juice would pass, but I still commented a lot, specially in my (extremely) niche subject. The juice won't flow, but the love will grow... Okay... so my point is that in midst of any link building process you should consider all links you can get. Even those bad nofollows. The simple logic behind any link building is that you are spreading the word about your content, you are marketing your content to other people who are surfing the net, be they webmasters or \"simple users.\" You just want those people to click through and get to know you. If they give you a chance, they might even like you enough to come back, again and again. Yo, a nofollow is a good thing then cuzz??? If you are asking if a nofollow link is a good thing, then, yeah. It can probably always be a good thing. Just try to follow: A link is a link. It brings traffic. If your site rocks, the visitors will love it. If those visitors have a site of their own, they will probably link to you later on. So a nofollow link = a proper, juice passing link later on. Jeez cuzz you just 'bout blew my mind Stop calling me cuzz. Anyway, I hope I made some sense. Can you also share your link building experiences? I'd sure love to hear 'em.
