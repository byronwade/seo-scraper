A By: Aaron Douglas December 23, 2009 My Top 5 Favorite SEO apps for iPhone SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Determined to move away from the desk and spend more time out in the world, I (like so many others) have become dependent on my iPhone for keeping connected to my business. “Productivity” is my favorite app category at the itunes store, and once I got checked out on all the project management and organization tools, I began investigating the tools more specific to the industry. While many seo apps proved to be disappointing, a few have remained on my phone, a couple of which I use on a daily basis. Pokeseo by John Christiansen – easy to use app that checks page rank and backlinks in top 4 engines. Best feature is the ability to email reports, which is something every seo app needs to start including. SenseEarn by Hans Schneider – allows you to view your Adsense accounts and review history. SenseEarn sports a very simple interface that allows you to keep current on your account activity (or lack thereof). It seems to work faster than logging on, but only allows for one account at a time (although you can change accounts easily enough). Analytics App by Inblosam LLC – while I had some accessibility issues in the past (support was very helpful), with the most recent update this is a fantastic app. Extensive reporting for visitors, traffic and content. Access to multiple accounts, clean interface, and the ability to create event tracking and custom reports makes this one of my most used apps. SEO Automatic by JAH Media, LLC – extensive analysis of on page factors (for the home page) and server-side optimization. SEO Automatic also provides evaluation and alerts for 18 page element ranging from alt tags to xml. Not only does it identify critical issues – it offers recommendation and even some positive reinforcement. One example is the URL canonicalization review (listed as “High to medium priority”). Not only does it check to see if http://domain.com redirects to the www version (preventing possible duplicate content issues), but when the criteria is met the section concludes with a complement (“whomever set up your site paid attention to details!”). SEO Search Ranking by Leon Huang – Simple Google rank-checker using AJAX API. Allows unlimited keywords for unlimited sites, and charts change over time for each keyword. Great way to keep tabs on positions and allows for an immediate answer to the question “how are we doing”. Can take a while to load a site profile if using a ton of keywords, and this needs an export feature for data. By far my favorite app on the list. I could have made this list longer if I spent more time on some of the other apps, but I stuck to the ones I use regularly. Would welcome any other recommendations, and am curious if there in anything available for the Android OS. Copied! Back to Top",
