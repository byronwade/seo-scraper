By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers June 7, 2017 New Site Crawl: Rebuilt to Find More Issues on More Pages, Faster Than Ever! Moz Tools | Advanced SEO | Moz News Read about the 5 new upgrades we've added to Site Crawl (as of September 2017) here! First, the good news — as of today, all Moz Pro customers have access to the new version of Site Crawl, our entirely rebuilt deep site crawler and technical SEO auditing platform. The bad news? There isn't any. It's bigger, better, faster, and you won't pay an extra dime for it. A moment of humility, though — if you've used our existing site crawl, you know it hasn't always lived up to your expectations. Truth is, it hasn't lived up to ours, either. Over a year ago, we set out to rebuild the back end crawler, but we realized quickly that what we wanted was an entirely re-imagined crawler, front and back, with the best features we could offer. Today, we launch the first version of that new crawler. Open Site Crawl Code name: AardwolfThe back end is entirely new. Our completely rebuilt \"Aardwolf\" engine crawls twice as fast, while digging much deeper. For larger accounts, it can support up to ten parallel crawlers, for actual speeds of up to 20X the old crawler. Aardwolf also fully supports SNI sites (including Cloudflare), correcting a major shortcoming of our old crawler. View/search *all* URLsOne major limitation of our old crawler is that you could only see pages with known issues. Click on \"All Crawled Pages\" in the new crawler, and you'll be brought to a list of every URL we crawled on your site during the last crawl cycle: You can sort this list by status code, total issues, Page Authority (PA), or crawl depth. You can also filter by URL, status codes, or whether or not the page has known issues. For example, let's say I just wanted to see all of the pages crawled for Moz.com in the \"/blog\" directory... I just click the [+], select \"URL,\" enter \"/blog,\" and I'm on my way. Do you prefer to slice and dice the data on your own? You can export your entire crawl to CSV, with additional data including per-page fetch times and redirect targets. Recrawl your site immediatelySometimes, you just can't wait a week for a new crawl. Maybe you relaunched your site or made major changes, and you have to know quickly if those changes are working. No problem, just click \"Recrawl my site\" from the top of any page in the Site Crawl section, and you'll be on your way... Starting at our Medium tier, you’ll get 10 recrawls per month, in addition to your automatic weekly crawls. When the stakes are high or you're under tight deadlines for client reviews, we understand that waiting just isn't an option. Recrawl allows you to verify that your fixes were successful and refresh your crawl report. Ignore individual issuesAs many customers have reminded us over the years, technical SEO is not a one-sized-fits-all task, and what's critical for one site is barely a nuisance for another. For example, let's say I don't care about a handful of overly dynamic URLs (for many sites, it's a minor issue). With the new Site Crawl, I can just select those issues and then \"Ignore\" them (see the green arrow for location): If you make a mistake, no worries — you can manage and restore ignored issues. We'll also keep tracking any new issues that pop up over time. Just because you don't care about something today doesn't mean you won't need to know about it a month from now. Fix duplicate contentUnder \"Content Issues,\" we've launched an entirely new duplicate content detection engine and a better, cleaner UI for navigating that content. Duplicate content is now automatically clustered, and we do our best to consistently detect the \"parent\" page. Here's a sample from Moz.com: You can view duplicates by the total number of affected pages, PA, and crawl depth, and you can filter by URL. Click on the arrow (far-right column) for all of the pages in the cluster (shown in the screenshot). Click anywhere in the current table row to get a full profile, including the source page we found that link on. Prioritize quickly & tacticallyPrioritizing technical SEO problems requires deep knowledge of a site. In the past, in the interest of simplicity, I fear that we've misled some of you. We attempted to give every issue a set priority (high, medium, or low), when the difficult reality is that what's a major problem on one site may be deliberate and useful on another. With the new Site Crawl, we decided to categorize crawl issues tactically, using five buckets: Critical Crawler Issues Crawler Warnings Redirect Issues Metadata Issues Content Issues Hopefully, you can already guess what some of these contain. Critical Crawler Issues still reflect issues that matter first to most sites, such as 5XX errors and redirects to 404s. Crawler Warnings represent issues that might be very important for some sites, but require more context, such as meta NOINDEX. Prioritization often depends on scope, too. All else being equal, one 500 error may be more important than one duplicate page, but 10,000 duplicate pages is a different matter. Go to the bottom of the Site Crawl Overview Page, and we've attempted to balance priority and scope to target your top three issues to fix: Moving forward, we're going to be launching more intelligent prioritization, including grouping issues by folder and adding data visualization of your known issues. Prioritization is a difficult task and one we haven't helped you do as well as we could. We're going to do our best to change that. Dive in & tell us what you think!All existing customers should have access to the new Site Crawl as of earlier this morning. Even better, we've been crawling existing campaigns with the Aardwolf engine for a couple of weeks, so you'll have history available from day one!
