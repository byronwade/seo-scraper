By: Rand Fishkin July 24, 2010 It's Gonna Be Good: August PRO Training Seminar Finalized SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Today, instead of playing in the uber-rare Seattle sunshine, I spent the day polishing off the PRO Training seminar schedule and it looks amazing. I'm excited to see these sessions myself (and I rarely sit through presentations). Check it out for yourself below; if you're inclined and available, we'd love to see you.Oh, and don't worry, I'm not cruelly sharing when we've already sold out. We still do have some seats left. Dates are Monday & Tuesday August 30th + 31st with the tools training half day Wednesday, September 1st. However, I would strongly urge you to register soon, as we've sold out by early August in each of the past 4 years.Top 5 Ways Our PRO Seminar is Different\"Tips\" Focused Content Many sessions that I attend have discussions and opinions as featured content. Although I think that can be great, our focus is 100% on providing value you can apply back to your sites + campaigns immediately. I've talked to every speaker and reviewed every outline - the sessions at our seminar are exclusively focused on making you smarter, faster and better at your job.Single-Track, Deep Dives by Only the Best Speakers Rather than panels of 2, 3, 4 or more speakers on an hourlong session, we have only a few sessions each day, enabling us to pick only the most talented, compelling speakers for our event. You can't pitch to speak at SEOmoz - it's by invitation only and those invites come because we've seen you speak many times and been seriously impressed. There are only 14 speakers in total at the event and every one is an oustanding presenter - we know because we've watched them.The Same Incentives for all Participants At many events, the real revenue comes from sales of booths, promotional materials or sponsored sessions. SEOmoz has none of these. Our primary goal with the PRO Training isn't to make money (being fully TAGFEE; this year, we anticipate the seminar to generate less than 4% of our gross with relatively slim margins), but to spread knowledge of SEO in a deep, meaningful way and meet many of our community members in person. We also pay for our speakers' transportation and hotels so they don't have the burden of selling to recoup travel costs.Less than 1/2 the Price of Other Events With a PRO membership, the event costs just $649. Add in a hotel for 2 nights and a flight from most US locations and it's still less than a single ticket to many of the larger conferences (e.g. the on-site price for Web 2.0 NYC or SES SF is $1,995).No Vendors, Pitches, Booths or SalesThere's no expo hall, no sponsors, no SWAG in a bag, no salespeople seeking to close a deal at lunch, nada. This event is about learning from experts, networking with peers and coming home with phenomenal, actionable information.The Full PRO Training ScheduleMonday, August 30th9:00am - 9:45am: It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad SERP The expansion of new results types in the search result pages has SEOs asking if traditional rankings are dead.
