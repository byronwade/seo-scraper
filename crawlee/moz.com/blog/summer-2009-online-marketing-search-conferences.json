By: Jennifer Sable Lopez June 24, 2009 Summer 2009 Online Marketing and Search Conferences SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Is it just me, or is it getting on hot in here? Well it IS summer time again, and this year there are some interesting (both national and global) summer online marketing conferences happening. Some of the mozzers will be attending and/or speaking and I thought this was a great time to let everyone know where we'll be, and in some cases, where we'd like to be! Online Marketing Summit: Portland - June 29, 2009 and Seattle - July 1, 2009 It's always great to participate at local events, and Rand will be speaking at both OMS Portland and OMS Seattle next week. These are coming up quickly but if you're in the area, they are a \"must\" attend. The OMS events focus specifically on all forms of online marketing from SEO to paid search to content management. They are full day events where attendees get a chance to learn in their own backyard. SMX Singapore – July 2-3, 2009 Our own Gillian Muessig is speaking on SEM for the CEO at SMX Singapore, as well as doing a site clinic. The speakers come from across the globe to provide both beginner and advanced paid and organic search topics. This year they have focused a couple of their tracks on the current financial situation, which will help attendees understand how to navigate (heh, get it, a search conference... nevermind) budget issues. Asia is a hot area right now for online marketing, and Singapore is the place to be! Pubcon London - July 4, 2009 Now this is the kind of conference that we all wish we could attend! Pubcon London is a one-day event that sticks to the \"Pub\"con roots, with an afternoon of talking shop at a pub. If you have attended Pubcon Vegas or South before you'll know that the pub part is where you get the most out of conferences anyway. Apparently there hasn't been a Pubcon London in a few years, so this would be a great time to mingle with some of the great search marketers. SMX Sao Paulo – August 4, 2009 Although it's only one day, SMX Sao Paulo is packed full of online marketing goodness. Everything from case studies, onsite analysis, ROI, social media, paid links and SEO (at least that's what I could gather from the site which is in Portuguese ;). SES San Jose – Aug 10-14 I will be attending SES San Jose and covering many of the sessions for the moz community. You know me (ok, maybe you don't) but I'm most interested in the \"Geek Speak Track.\" We'll have to see if they get geeky enough for me! In addition to the 3 days of sessions based on various search marketing tracks, there are also 2 days of additional training workshops. The lineup is phenomenal and hearing Clay Shirky speak at the keynote on the first day will definitely be a highlight for me! If you're going to be there, and you see me wandering around, please say hello! (ok, say hello even if I'm not wandering around.) SEOmoz Pro Training Series 2009 – Aug 24-25, 2009 You better sign up for this one ASAP! From what I hear, the SEOmoz Pro Training Series seats sell out quickly and there are only 220 seats. ;) This year we have a wicked line-up of speakers, topics that will blow your mind and of course, plenty of networking and parties to soothe the soul. I could really go on and on but Scott has already done a great job of explaining all the details. So hurry up now and Sign Up Now! Whew, those are some serious educational opportunities! I'm sure I've missed a few, so please let me know if there are any to add, and whether you'll be attending. It's always great to meet people from the moz community! Copied! Back to Top",
