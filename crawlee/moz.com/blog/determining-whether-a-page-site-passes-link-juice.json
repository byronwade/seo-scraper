Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin March 30, 2010 Determining Whether a Page/Site Passes Link Juice (and How Much) Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. We've been hearing some requests lately for some really advanced, expert-level content, and this post is here to deliver. I've built up a short list of topics that deal with more cutting edge SEO, and if there's interest in this series, I'll try to make it a regular part of the blog. These tactics aren't black or gray hat (we're not advocates of that kind of thing), but they're very specific in use and tend to be at the opposite end of the \"low-hanging fruit\" basket. The first in the series touches on a common SEO problem - determing if a link has value and how much. This tactic isn't low effort, so it should only be employed when the link or link source is particularly critical. Testing Whether a Page/Site Passes Link Juice (and How Much) Scenario: You've found some potentially valuable, but possibly suspect link sources. These could include things like a seemingly high quality directory that requires payment or a site you're worried may have aroused Google's ire for one reason or another. The need for a credible answer applies anytime you're unsure whether a link is counting in Google's rankings and need to know. Tactic: Find a page that's already in Google's index and a somewhat random combination of words/phrases from that page's title and body for which it ranks in position #3-10. For example, with the query - http://www.google.com/search?q=new+york+presentation+morning+entitled+link, my blog post from last week on Link Magnets ranks #3. The query itself is not particularly competitive and the pages outranking it don't have the exact text in the title or domain name (a critical part of the process). If I now place a link with the exact anchor text from another page (like the blog post you're reading now), e.g. new york presentation morning entitled link, I should be able to see, once this post is indexed by Google's spider, whether it passes link juice. The result will be positive if the page moves up 2-4 positions in ranking and I can be fairly assured that the link is indeed \"Google-friendly.\" With that knowledge secure, I can change the anchor text and/or repoint the link to the desired location. I don't simply use the anchor text I want initially because with competitive queries, a single link may not make enough difference for the ranking impact to be visible and I don't want to waste my time/money/energy. (Metrics displayed in the SERPs via mozbar) Special Requirements: To make the testing work, you'll need to be able to repoint the link, change the anchor text or 301 redirect the linked-to page (though the last of these is the least desirable, since 301s lose some link juice in the process and good anchor text is so valuable for ranking in Google). Also, here at SEOmoz, we don't recommend buying links, so while this tactic could be applied to that process, remember that manipulative links may later be devalued, wasting all that time and effort you spent acquiring them. Results: With this technique, you can not only get a yes/no answer to questions about whether the link passes ranking value, but a rough sense for how much (depending on the position change - this can be a good reason to use pages that rank in the #7-10 range). Do take care to record the ranking positions of all the pages in the results and leave the test running for 1-2 weeks (longer if there's very fresh results ranking for the query). If you don't, other factors may conflate to hide the true results. I'm looking foward to your feedback about this technique - and let us know if you're interested in seeing more of this advanced/edge-case content on the blog, too.

If you do like this kind of thing, I'd also suggest: Register for SMX Advanced: Seattle or SMX Advanced: London - both are quite good and SEOmoz will be sending speakers to both. You can use the code SEOmoz@SMX for a 10% discount to either event. Check out the SEOmoz Expert Training Series DVD, which just launched last week. The video alone will get you pretty excited :-) PRO members should check out our libraries of tips, video content and webinars. I'm in Tampa, then Miami this week, but will finally return to Seattle for some much needed time in the office next Monday. Until then, blogging, commenting & email may be a bit slow from me. Copied!
