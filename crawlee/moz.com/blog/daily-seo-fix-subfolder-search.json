By: Emilie Martin March 13, 2023 Daily SEO Fix: Exploring Subfolder Search with Moz Pro Moz Tools A subfolder, also known as a subdirectory, is a way of organizing the pages on your website. They can be thought of as a way to divide up information or products, depending on your business. Within a subfolder, there can be more subfolders stacked within, like nesting dolls! Subfolders can be great for your website and for SEO. Having clear landing pages for your subfolders is important to both the searcher and the crawler. They are also another way to earn more backlinks, contributing to a greater Domain Authority. A subfolder could be a blog, a product category, an Etsy store, and more! You may not have thought of conducting keyword research or competitive research for your subfolder, but now may just be the time to look into it. Here’s the good news — you can conduct subfolder research with Moz Pro! Follow the videos below to understand how to get the most out of researching your subfolder with Moz Pro tools. Why You Should Do Subfolder Research There are several different ways subfolders can be used on your website. Learn all about why subfolder research is important for your business.

Search by subfolder using this tool to discover the number of keywords that you rank for, and the top keywords you rank for, along with keyword metrics that help you understand which keywords you should be focusing your efforts on. Subfolder Search with True Competitor You can use the ‘True Competitor’ tool in Moz Pro’s Competitive Research suite to figure out who your competitors are for your subfolder. See who your top 25 competitors are, some you may already know about, and some may not. Explore more metrics to understand which competitors you should pay closer attention to. Subfolder Search with Keyword Gap Dig a little deeper with the Moz ‘Keyword Gap’ tool. Input your own subfolder, and your previously discovered competitors to explore the keywords that you share with them.
