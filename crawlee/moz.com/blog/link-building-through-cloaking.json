C By: ClickMagnet67 March 18, 2008 Link Building Through Cloaking? Link Building This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. As if SEO does not have a bad enough rep out on the Internet, companies go and create link building schemes like this: \"In a nutshell, the WMC system will automatically create up to 5,000 unique search engine-friendly content pages (seen only by the search engines). Because your website will have so much content (which the search engines love to see), your site will rank very high (page one or two of search results) which will cause a flood of traffic.\" That is a direct quote from Cool Site of the Day. When I went to WMC, they do not mention \"cloaking\" (at least, I didn't see it). Am I too \"touchy\" on this subject? I do believe when you start talking about cloaking in any form (a.k.a. seen only by the search engines), you are now doing a great disservice to the SEO community. To top it off, I wonder how many people are actually going to purchase this software in the hopes of being on the first page of Google. Just my two cents. What are your thoughts? Copied!
