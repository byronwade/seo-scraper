By: Cheryl Draper Edited By: Emilie Martin January 3, 2024 Convince Your Boss to Send You to MozCon 2024 [Plus Bonus Letter Template] SEO Events | Moz News MozCon is returning in person to Seattle on June 3 & 4, 2024, and this year, we’re excited to bring the Future of Digital Marketing to our stage. From networking with peers, hearing from industry leaders, and making new connections that can help grow your business or career, conferences offer so many benefits to attendees. You know that. Your peers know that. But how do you persuade the powers-that-be (aka your boss) that sending you is beneficial for your business? Don’t worry, we’ve got a plan. And if you want to skip ahead to the letter template, here it is: Make a copy of the letter template!! How to make the case Business competition is fiercer than ever. Only those who are able to shift tactics with the changing tides of marketing will be able to come out on top. And that’s exactly what MozCon is going to help you do. Covering everything a growing marketer needs (SEO, content, strategy, analytics), MozCon delivers top-notch talks from hand-selected speakers over two days in June. There's so much in store for you this year. Here’s just a sampling of what you can expect at this year’s MozCon: Speakers and content Our speakers are real practitioners and industry leaders. We work with them to ensure they deliver the best content and insights to set you up for a year of success. No sales pitches or talking heads here! Networking You work hard taking notes, learning new insights, and digesting all of that knowledge — that’s why we think you deserve a little fun. It's your chance to decompress with fellow attendees and make new friends in the industry. We host exciting evening networking events that add to the value you'll get from your day of education. Plus, our Birds of a Feather lunch tables allow you to connect with like-minded peers who share similar interests. High-quality videos to share with your team About a month or so after the conference, we release professionally edited videos of every presentation at the conference. Many of our ticket types include free access! Your colleagues won’t get to partake in the real-time experience (the #FOMO is real), but they will get a chance to learn everything you did. Great food on site We know that conference food isn’t typically worth mentioning, but MozCon is notorious for its cornucopia of tasty offerings. You can expect two meals a day and loads of snacks from local Seattle vendors — in the past, we’ve featured a smorgasbord from the likes of Trophy cupcakes, KuKuRuZa popcorn, and Starbucks’ Seattle Reserve cold brew. Discounts for purchasing early Early birds get to save big on their ticket cost; the earlier you purchase, the deeper the savings. But of course, don’t take our word for it! There are some incredible resources available at your fingertips that tout the benefits of attending conferences: The best planned, executed, and designed conference out there! I have attended in past years and brought my new team — I was hoping to dazzle them, and MozCon did! — Sarah S., Outdoor Research Thank you so much for making MozCon another great success; Seattle is a destination on its own, and I look forward to attending again. — Jason D., Black Truck Media This was my first MozCon, and I had a blast. The people who work in this field are generally just amazing people, and the event was so well organized and run. I forgot how much I like being around people! — Jill H., Amsive DigitalI thought the event was run amazingly; the venue, the food, the setup, and the talks were all brilliant. I have seen a decline in recent conferences, specifically in Europe, where I think it’s quite well known the quality is dropping, quality of the talks specifically. I think MozCon holds high standards and sets itself apart from competitors. I loved the rooftop vibes, too! — Carrie R., Rise at Seven Loved it. First-time attendee and lucky enough to bring along 4 of my team; we learned a lot and had a blast. — Matt P., Intrepid Travel Need a little more to get your boss on board? Check out some videos from years past to get a taste of the caliber of our speakers. Buy ticket, save money, get competitive marketing insights. Everyone wins! MozCon is one unforgettable experience that lives and grows with you beyond just the days you spend attending the conference. And there's no time like the present to pitch MozCon to your boss. If they're still stuck on the \"why,\" let them know about our Extremely Early and Super Early Bird pricing tiers — you’ll save hundreds of dollars when you do. Just think of all the Keurigs you could get for that communal kitchen! Be sure to grab the letter template and make your case the easy way — make a copy of the letter template.
