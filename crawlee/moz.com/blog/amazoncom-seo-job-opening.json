By: Rand Fishkin May 27, 2005 Amazon.com SEO Job Opening Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. If you're in Seattle and want to work for the biggest e-tailer around, Amazon.com is hiring right now for a \"Manager, Search Engine Optimization\". The required qualifications are actually somewhat reasonable, and I don't doubt that the pay is great. Let's just hope they don't hire someone too good at their job and put all the affiliates out of business. With Amazon's link popularity, my guess would be that a few technical tweaks and some promotional campaigns for their highest revenue products would be all that's neccessary to bring Amazon into top 5 positions for tens of thousands of high-traffic searches.
