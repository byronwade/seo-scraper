J By: Joe Mangum January 17, 2012 How Does Google's Search Plus Your World Impact Adwords and Other Forms of Online Marketing? Marketing Industry This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. As you've probably heard, Google has done it again! Yes, they've done it again. They changed the game. With the unveiling of their latest attempt at providing more personal search results, Google Plus Your World is causing a lot of \"GASPS\" in the SEO world. Many are convinced Google, plus Your World will lead to concerns and issues for both Google and its users. I agree it is going to force many individuals and businesses to heavily consider upping their game in the Google+ world. Since Google+ profiles and pages will receive higher precedence in the SERPS for users searching while logged into their Google account, it only makes sense for businesses to push interaction and connectivity through the Google social media platform. Understandably, this could be seen as Google trying once again to force their way into the social media world. There is a list a mile wide of items we could discuss in regards to how the algorithm change will affect users in the SEO and Social Media world (That being said, before you start trying to build out massive circles and connections on your Google+ profile, you should read this article). However, I don't think most people are considering how this change is going to play out for Google and their \"cash cow.\" I'm speaking, of course, about Google Adwords. Plus Your World and Google Adwords I say this because keeping up with the latest changes and trends in SEO and social media is a huge undertaking for most companies. It's going to be no different with this one. If you want to play the organic game, you're going to have to embrace the change and jump on the bus. Otherwise, you're going to be, \"left at the station waiting for the next ride.\" I think Google has an underlying purpose (if not underlying then at least a side purpose) at play here as well. Because, for those who don't wish to embrace the change, they'll be forced to jump into the PPC world. If they are already there, they will likely be needing to sky-rocket their Max CPC (cost-per-click) in order to stay on the front page. What this means for current Adwords users: Increased competition Higher bidding on keywords Lower click-through-rate due to increased CTR for personalized results Lower quality scores More time spent monitoring and reacting to competition Also, unless you want to be stuck on the bottom left of the front page, you'll need to bid high enough to make the top three ads. What this means for Adwords \"fence-sitters\": Decreased traffic (unless social presence and branding is strong) Fewer conversions/sales Increased pressure to pay for Adwords Websites that previously were ranking on the front page of Google consistently for their target keywords will start to be replaced by personalized (\"more relevant\" according to Google) listings. These listings will show up because individuals within the searcher's sphere of influence will have either shared them, referenced or interacted with them through Google+ or other Google accounts (including email!). Thus, the only way to ensure that your site shows up on the front page no matter what will be to pay for Adwords. In some ways, I see this as a brilliant move by Google. A good businesses recognizes where their wealth lies and invests in ideas to leverage that as much as possible. In this case, for Google it is in Adwords. I know that many are under the assumption that Google is envious of Facebook and their \"time on site\" clout. Perhaps they are a little jealous. I'm sure that Google hopes to be able to capture some of the market in the social world by subtly funneling users into using their Google+ platform. However, I can't help but think this has a lot to do with the potential increase in Adspend per Adwords client resulting in enormous increases in Ad revenue for Google. We'll see how everything plays out but we can't ignore the impact this could have on the overall cost of internet marketing for the advertiser. What About the SEOs? More money will likely need to be transitioned from traditional forms of advertising into internet marketing. Each time there is a huge change in the search engines, the more streamlined ways of boosting rankings developed by cheap SEO companies die off and become less effective. This makes the true SEO's job more meaningful and valuable. However, now, instead of simply finding a good SEO to handle your website, companies will need to hire more strategic PPC experts, more informed social media experts and proven online branding companies to ensure that their message is being heard across the web. What are your thoughts? Is Google using this more as a way to pry their way into the social game or are they vying more for what talks for Google... cold hard cash? Also, how will this change influence current SEO, social media and other internet marketing companies? Copied! Back to Top",
