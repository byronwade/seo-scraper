By: Rebecca Kelley January 24, 2008 (Belated) Thursday Roundup for the Week of 1/20/08 SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Sorry for the delay in getting this out out to you all, but today was pretty hectic for both me and Rand. Technically it's still Thursday on the west coast, so at least I squeaked by and hit my deadline... OH, and I just realized that I totally blog blocked Scott and his Whiteboard Friday post, so everyone stop reading this, go watch the video, then come back and read this. It's only fair. Stories, news, and other notable items from the past week: Two star links (that's right, the inaugural one!): A study unsurprisingly shows that what a boss looks like determines how he performs. Isn't this the \"dress for success\" mentality? Three star links: SEO-Chick Stephanie gives 10 reasons why you should still be using Facebook. It's a nice, optimistic read that stands out among the increasing \"Facebook has jumped the shark\" posts that have been hitting the web lately. The SEMMY finalists have been announced. I think you can vote. Or something. Oh, who am I kidding, I'm more geared up for the Oscars. Juno got four nominations! Tamar Weinberg follows the uproar over the announced algorithm changes on Digg. The poor girl was up until the wee hours live blogging the webcast interview between Kevin Rose and Jay Adelson and some top diggers. She does a good job of outlining everything for us lazy schmucks. ReadWriteWeb identifies pros and cons of the \"work from home\" generation. I personally prefer to work in an office--I enjoy interacting with my coworkers and there are fewer distractions (no Wii, Rock Band, or DVR at work!). SEO Wrench created desktop icons for his iphone bookmarks, and he made one for SEOmoz. Aw, shucks... Wall Street Journal, have you learned nothing from the New York Times? They plan on keeping a significant portion of its content behind its paid subscription wall. Notice the graph of top newspaper websites--hmm, wonder why the NYT is so high... Four star links: Continuing on with the Wall Street Journal's unwise decision, last year a record number of readers visited U.S. online newspaper sites. This is especially interesting because it really poses a growing problem for print newspapers. Subscriptions decrease every year, and fewer and fewer younger demographics are bothering to subscribe to print newspapers. It's fascinating to see how the Internet is altering this traditional news medium. Domain tasting should be fresh in your memories if you read Sarah's post. It is rumored that Google will stop monetizing any domains that are less than five days old, which should effectively kill domain tasting. Tropical SEO and Sugarrae write counter posts to Rand's post about advice for startup CEOs. It's great to have different viewpoints from other CEOs/entrepreneurs, and they both make valid points. Five star links: Neither Rand nor I were terribly wowed by any big news or stories this week, so I'll just leave you with some babie care do's and don'ts instead. YOUmoz entries: Updating Site = Lost Rankings? Agco asks the moz community if updating your site will cause a temporary loss in rankings. Track Your Keyword Ranking Results. Fdep reviews a keyword ranking program called Advanced Web Ranking. The \"Link Monster\" Lives Inside All SEOs. Carfeu talks about how all SEOs have a little link monster growing inside them, and that we all love a good opportunity to gain links. Bait and Switch - with FAST FOOD? JustFred eases his love of Del Taco into his discussion about how a bait ad switch strategy on your website could ruin the trust you've built and the credibility you've established. How to Write for the Web. Nabha gives some great tips on how to capture your reader's attention and engage him/her online. Humour - Does it Help or Hinder SEOmoz? SiteMosts ponders to the masses whether SEOmoz's penchant for humor in our posts and throughout our site helps or harms our business and community. (The consensus seems to be \"helps.\") Who Loves Ya, Baby? Lorisa authors yet another well-written post that posits whether we choose our audience or our audience chooses us. Using Subdomains Ad-Naseum Still Works?! Surely Not... RichardBaxterSEO finds that Google hasn't truly effectively tackled that pesky subdomains ranking issue. SEO Contract Template: A Verbal Contract Isn't Worth the Paper it's Written On. Crash provides us with a thorough sample SEO contract. Best of YOUmoz: Yes Dear, There is Porn in SEO, and We Can Learn a Lot From It from XMCP is a thumb-attracting post (28 and counting!) that discusses how we can actually learn a lot about Internet marketing by studying SEO for porn sites. It's a very well fleshed out (no pun intended--well, maybe a little) and intriguing post. New events added to the Events Calendar: No new upcoming events.
