By: Patrick Curtis April 25, 2018 How We Got a 32% Organic Traffic Boost from 4 On-Page SEO Changes [Case Study] On-page SEO | Search Engines | Advanced SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. My name is Patrick Curtis, and I'm the founder and CEO of Wall Street Oasis, an online community focused on careers in finance founded in 2006 with over 2 million visits per month. User-generated content and long-tail organic traffic is what has built our business and community over the last 12+ years. But what happens if you wake up one day and realize that your growth has suddenly stopped? This is what happened to us back in November 2012. In this case study, I’ll highlight two of our main SEO problems as a large forum with over 200,000 URLs, then describe two solutions that finally helped us regain our growth trajectory — almost five years later. Two main problems1. Algorithm change impactsEver since November 2012, Google’s algo changes have seemed to hurt many online forums like ours. Even though our traffic didn’t decline, our growth dropped to the single-digit percentages. No matter what we tried, we couldn’t break through our “plateau of pain” (I call it that because it was a painful ~5 years trying). 2. Quality of user-generated contentRelated to the first problem, 99% of our content is user-generated (UGC) which means the quality is mixed (to put it kindly). Like most forum-based sites, some of our members create incredible pieces of content, but a meaningful percentage of our content is also admittedly thin and/or low-quality. How could we deal with over 200,000 pieces of content efficiently and try to optimize them without going bankrupt? How could we “clean the cruft” when there was just so much of it? Fighting back: Two solutions (and one statistical analysis to show how it worked)1. \"Merge and Purge\" projectOur goal was to consolidate weaker “children” URLs into stronger “master” URLs to utilize some of the valuable content Google was ignoring and to make the user experience better. For example, instead of having ~20 discussions on a specific topic (each with an average of around two to three comments) across twelve years, we would consolidate many of those discussions into the strongest two or three URLs (each with around 20–30 comments), leading to a much better user experience with less need to search and jump around the site. Changes included taking the original post and comments from a “child” URL and merging them into the “master” URL, unpublishing the child URL, removing the child from sitemap, and adding a 301 redirect to the master. Below is an example of how it looked when we merged a child into our popular Why Investment Banking discussion. We highlighted the original child post as a Related Topic with a blue border and included the original post date to help avoid confusion: This was a massive project that involved some complex Excel sorting, but after 18 months and about $50,000 invested (27,418 children merged into 8,515 masters to date), the user experience, site architecture, and organization is much better. Initial analysis suggests that the percentage gain from merging weak children URLs into stronger masters has given us a boost of ~10–15% in organic search traffic. 2. The Content Optimization TeamThe goal of this initiative was to take the top landing pages that already existed on Wall Street Oasis and make sure that they were both higher quality and optimized for SEO. What does that mean, exactly, and how did we execute it? We needed a dedicated team that had some baseline industry knowledge. To that end, we formed a team of five interns from the community, due to the fact that they were familiar with the common topics. We looked at the top ~200 URLs over the previous 90 days (by organic landing page traffic) and listed them out in a spreadsheet: We held five main hypotheses of what we believed would boost organic traffic before we started this project: Longer content with subtitles: Increasing the length of the content and adding relevant H2 and H3 subtitles to give the reader more detailed and useful information in an organized fashion. Changing the H1 so that it matched more high-volume keywords using Moz’s Keyword Explorer. Changing the URL so that it also was a better match to high-volume and relevant keywords. Adding a relevant image or graphic to help break up large “walls of text” and enrich the content. Adding a relevant video similar to the graphic, but also to help increase time on page and enrich the content around the topic. We tracked all five of these changes across all 200 URLs (see image above). After a statistical analysis, we learned that four of them helped our organic search traffic and one actually hurt. Summary of results from our statistical analysis Increasing the length of the articles and adding relevant subtitles (H2s, H3s, and H4s) to help organize the content gives an average boost to organic traffic of 14% Improving the title or H1 of the URLs yields a 9% increase on average Changing the URL decreased traffic on average by 38% (this was a smaller sample size — we stopped doing this early on for obvious reasons) Including a relevant video increases the organic traffic by 4% on average, while putting an image up increases it by 5% on average. Overall, the boost to organic traffic — should we continue to make these four changes (and avoid changing the URL) — is 32% on average. Key takeaway:Over half of that gain (~18%) comes from changes that require a minimal investment of time. For teams trying to optimize on-page SEO across a large number of pages, we recommend focusing on the top landing pages first and easy wins before deciding if further investment is warranted. We hope this case study of our on-page SEO efforts was interesting, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have in the comments! Copied! Back to Top",
