By: jamersan April 30, 2008 The .com Search Result Phenomenon Search Engines This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Today I was trying to pull up a website when my computer had one of those hiccups. Somehow, I only managed to get .com in the address bar before I pressed enter. As it typically does when it can't find a site, my browser forwards me to Google's results for the term \".com\". The results I received were a little surprising and I would like to know the SEOmoz community's thoughts on it. The strangeness of these results piqued my curiosity and I am excited to see what everyone's theory on these results are. The top 30 results I received, in order, were: Myspace.com Yahoo.com Amazon.com Answers.com MSN.com Linux.com CNN.com Ask.com Dictionary.reference.com Weather.com Weather.com (again!) Go.com Live.com Whatis.techtarget.com Lycos.com Verisign.com Bartleby.com NationalGeographic.com Download.com About.com Real.com Spaceweather.com Mozilla.com Mail.yahoo.com Google.com Refdesk.com Washingtonpost.com Comcast.com Usatoday.com Wordpress.com Myspace had the nice big \"more results\" layout where it lists 8 links to different areas of the site. In my experience, Google usually only displays this type of listings when a site pretty much owns a keyword search for an extended period of time. Also of interest were the \"Searches related to: .com\" unvision.com realtor.com target.com rotten.com lyrics.com break.com I know many, if not all of you may get different results, but this is what was showing for me as of 4:30PM Central Time on Thursday. Why would Google rank 25th on its own search engine for a term that applies to any .com site out there when weather.com shows in both the 10th and 11th places? Why are the related searches not any of the sites in the top 30 results? Copied! Back to Top",
