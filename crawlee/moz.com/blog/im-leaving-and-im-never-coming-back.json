By: Anthony Kirlew March 18, 2008 I'm Leaving and I'm Never Coming Back... Online Advertising This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Is this what your website visitors are saying? One of the sites that I work with has a very high \"new visitor\" percentage and while the visitor count continues to grow, there is clearly a problem in that the numbers are not growing exponentially as they should with a near 80% return visitor rate. What's the problem? Well, it's never just one thing, but here are a few thoughts: 1. The visitors don't see any value in returning. This may due to the fact that the site has little to offer in terms of interaction. I am working on getting a blog on that site, which should help build more of a community around the blog. It will also allow people to subscribe to the blog and its comments, which should increase return visits. 2. Not enough communication with members. Sure, there is email marketing, but perhaps the messages aren't being sent consistently enough. Actually, I know this to be true and I am working on an email marketing plan to maintain consistent contact with the members of this site. The bigger problem will be getting them to open the emails and take action (i.e, come back to the site). 3. Usability. I will defer to Dr. Pete on this one, but I am nearly positive that the site does not employ optimal usability guidelines. Why not? Like many sites, this one has a lot of \"I want this to be on the site, right here,\" and \"I think we should add this, so throw it in\" aspects to it. Maybe this article will give him enough \"link love\" to compel him to want to do some pro bono work (just kidding, Doc). What really stinks is working to generate new visitors month after month, and not seeing the desired results. Hopefully by implementing the above items, I can increase the number of site visitors while decreasing the percentage of new visitors. Copied! Back to Top",
