Disclaimer: This post doesn’t include any information about SEO. If you are looking for SEO related content, please read the normal search related posts on this blog. UPDATE: I clarified below that it is the winners of the 4 rounds that won, not just people who chose the winning weapon. Danny Dover and Timmy Christensen (Our User Interface Expert) prepare for the game Monday morning SEOmoz sent an e-mail to all PRO members asking them if they would be willing to beta test our awesomely big and useful tool. I only had enough resources to run the test with 300 people so I tried to come up with a solution to narrow down the list that was both fun and fair. If the e-mail recipients were interested, they were asked to fill out a form with their name, SEOmoz account e-mail, website and their choice of either rock, paper or scissors (RPS). We had about 1000 people fill out the form (Thank You!) and I ran the data through a nifty simulator I hacked together. The entries were interestingly unequal: To run the simulator, I put all the entries in a spreadsheet and sorted them by weapon of choice. I then removed anyone who either did not include a weapon or chose a non-applicable item (Atomic Bomb, Shark with Laser, Dynamite, Sushi, Rand, etc.). Next, I randomized the list, cut it in half and faced everyone against another player. I then abused the formula line by adding the rules of game. =IF(AND(C2=\"Paper\",G2=\"Paper\"), \"Tie\", IF(AND(C2=\"Rock\",G2=\"Rock\"), \"Tie\", IF(AND(C2=\"Scissors\",G2=\"Scissors\"), \"Tie\", IF(AND(C2=\"Paper\",G2=\"Rock\"), \"Left\", IF(AND(C2=\"Scissors\",G2=\"Paper\"), \"Left\", IF(AND(C2=\"Rock\",G2=\"Scissors\"), \"Left\", IF(AND(C2=\"Rock\",G2=\"Paper\"), \"Right\", IF(AND(C2=\"Paper\",G2=\"Scissors\"), \"Right\", IF(AND(C2=\"Scissors\",G2=\"Rock\"), \"Right\", \"WTF?\" ))))))))) (Left and Right indicate which side of the spreadsheet the winner was on.) Afterward, I removed the losers, re-randomized the list, cut it in half and lined up every player with an opponent. It took 4 rounds. Although there was a clear majority weapon victory, it is the winners of the four rounds that will become beta testers, most of which chose paper. The winners will be alerted via e-mail in the coming days. Thanks to everyone who played! P.S. Sometimes, I do actual work here at the moz. I have a 'real' post coming out later this week. ;-) Copied! Back to Top",
