O By: Oliver Bayes-Shelton February 5, 2009 The Future for SEO Social Media This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. So as we all know, universal searching is going to be more widespread in the future. But we all know that images, videos and news comes from social media portals. So does this mean that in order to make an effective SEO campaign, an SMO campaign is equally important? My thoughts on this matter are that we need to spend some time learning video editing, editorial writing and Image editing. \"Why?\" you ask. We know from reading the SEOmoz blog that if you use a third party host for your video you will lose traffic, but I have a video editing method that involves adding images, links, comments and words into the video. Give the viewer your brand, which will give you direct traffic or organic searching. A good way of doing this is by adding your image to every frame (like at the bottom parallel to the YouTube image). Adding a frame at the beginning and at the end, giving the viewer your link , information and contact details, will prove very valuable. With regard to images, I feel that you should always watermark the images with your logo and URL so that every time the image is used or viewed, your brand is in the image. With regard to news, you now need to write like a blogger and think like an editor. Start reading blogs, pick up tips, etc, so that every time you write a blog post or article you get links, links, links with help from the SEO campaign. Finally, we all need to focus on social media portals to build up brand awareness by making groups, profiles, friends, and interesting information. I feel that to be an SEO expert you also need to be a blogger and an SMO expert. I hope to hear your thoughts on this. Copied! Back to Top",
