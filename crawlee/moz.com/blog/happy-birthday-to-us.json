By: Rand Fishkin October 14, 2005 Happy Birthday to Us Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. SEOmoz turned 1 year old today. Our first post, way back on October 14th of last year shows just how far we've come. I'm really happy with the way this site has turned out and I have great things in mind (particularly with relation to the tools) over the next 3-6 months. Now also seems like a good time to ask for feedback - do you like the site? Want to see something more in the way of content? advice? articles? I know everyone wants the tools to work again, but you'll have to take that up with the meanies at Yahoo! & Google. And, of course, if there's something that really irks you about the usability or design of the site, just leave a note. Thanks for all your visits and links, I hope the next year sees even more growth. Stay tuned. Copied! Back to Top",
