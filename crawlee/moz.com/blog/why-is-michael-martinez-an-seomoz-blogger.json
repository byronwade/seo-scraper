By: Rand Fishkin August 18, 2006 Why is Michael Martinez an SEOmoz Blogger? SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. During the past few months, I've received more than a few emails asking me about Mr. Martinez's position on the SEOmoz blog. At the SES conference in San Jose, a small handful asked the same question - here's the response I gave them: Michael's views and opinions are not mainstream. They don't always have the kind of logic that's easy for many of us to follow (myself included). Michael's also not the kind of person to let a disagreement stand - his ceasless attempts to refute arguments and prove the rightness of his ways sometimes frustrates and often annoys. However, Michael... Keeps us Honest By questioning the theories about search, technology & the web that we hold in high esteem, Michael forces us to back up our beliefs with logic & examples - I haven't changed my mind on things like the importance of links or the value of Firefox, but that doesn't mean the excercise itself isn't valuable. Introduces Alternate Points of ViewThe worst disservice we can do in our professional developments is to limit our exposure to those viewpoints we disagree with. This happens all the time in the field of geopolitics, and I believe it damages our ability to think beyond our own interests and small-minded beliefs. Obviously, Michael's viewpoint isn't helping staunch liberals see the value in pieces of conservative economic policy, but even on a small scale, it's worthwhile. Brings in LinksYes, it's selfish, but Michael's posts do attract readership, clickthroughs and links. This one on links, specifically, has 30+ unique links to it. I know that many folks in the search community don't share my belief that Michael's contributions are valuable, but I'd ask you to re-consider. I'd also ask you to question whether SEOmoz and the search world in general would be better off with dissonant viewpoints. Please note that while I'd love to get feedback on this post and on your attitudes, I would ask that you remain as civil and positive as possible. Thanks! Copied! Back to Top",
