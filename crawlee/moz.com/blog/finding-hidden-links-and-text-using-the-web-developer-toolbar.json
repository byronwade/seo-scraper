T By: Theo van der Zee March 31, 2009 Finding Hidden Links and Text Using the Web Developer Toolbar Blogging This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. White hat versus black hat SEO seems like a never-ending discussion. An action one SEO finds absolutely fair might be seen as downright cheating by another. The ambiguity in the guidelines from search engines such as Google usually isn't adding much clearness to the discussion either. On some issues, however, the search engines are crystal clear, and hidden links/hidden text is one of those. Information on the matter is given in both the Google Guidelines and on the personal blog of Matt Cutts: hidden text and links are not allowed. Why do I want to find hidden text and links? There could be a variety of reasons as to why you want to find hidden links or text on a website: You want to review your own website for (accidental?) hidden links or textYou want to screen the website of a prospect for illegal activitiesYou want to report/out a competitor for using illegal tacticsYou want to find out if your (illegally) hidden text and links can be found manually by search engineers or competitors What tools do I need to find hidden text and links? You could use a variety of methods to find hidden text and links. Some of the fastest are hitting 'ctrl-a' (select all) to see if any text or links light up that were hidden before. Unfortunately, this tactic only shows text and links hidden by using the oldest method in the book: making them the same color as the background behind them. Because the tactics used to hide links and text have improved, so should our toolset. Therefore, I shall introduce to you a powerful combination of tools that can be used in our quest to find hidden text and links: Firefox and the Web Developer Toolbar. Using this combination will enable us to 'edit' the website we are looking at on the fly.
