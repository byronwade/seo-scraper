M By: MatSiltala February 3, 2007 Taking Advantage of Google News Branding This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Google News can be a powerful tool for finding super targeted websites to get amazing traffic from. I know I am not alone when looking for places with great authority to send me traffic, so I think this tip could be beneficial for those frustrated with figuring out great places to get started with press. I am not taking anything away from the typical PR sites like PR Web, but how much more do you think it would benefit your site to get a link from a press/media site that is 100% related? This is where you can really take advantage of Google News. Let's say you have a site selling memory foam mattresses. Go to Google News and, in the \"News Search\" section, search for \"memory foam mattress,\" and you will see what I am talking about. Here are a couple of results in the top 3: Furniture World Magazine (Press Release) Home Textiles Today These are two very targeted \"furniture\" related press/media sites that accept article submissions or press release and get really good traffic and link love. From what I see, a lot of these kind of sites have their own static article pages with very few outbound links. It all comes down to finding amazing press links that can give you quality traffic. I've had good fortune with submitting to these kind of press sites as an alternative to some of the more \"mainstream\" press sites. Copied! Back to Top",
