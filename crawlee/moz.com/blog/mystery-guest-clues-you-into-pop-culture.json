By: Rand Fishkin September 8, 2006 Mystery Guest Clues You Into Pop Culture Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. This morning, Mystery Guest made an appearance in Cranium's new online version of their Pop 5 Game. It's a take on guessing pop culture references based on visual clues and the web team has done a great job making it into a Flash game. Sadly, the flash portal doesn't provide a link back to the main site, so the link love is getting lost in the single, dynamic URL. They're also not doing any keyword targeting on the page (even in the page title), so there's a lot of missed opportunity to get rankings in the engines, but this is one time when the content is more interesting to me than the SEO mistakes. Congrats to Mystery Guest and the Cranium team. I hope other folks have fun playing these - Since MG writes much of the content, it's no fun playing with her :) Copied! Back to Top",
