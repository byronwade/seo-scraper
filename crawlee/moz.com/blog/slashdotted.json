By: Rand Fishkin December 7, 2005 Slashdotted Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. SEOmoz's Beginner's Guide was just Slashdotted. We'll see how the server holds up, but there's a lot of very big files to be accessed there... Sorry for any lag. More to report soon. UPDATE: The lag should be gone by now. We made some quick fixes and things appear to be working brilliantly. To date, the Slashdotting has sent us more than 3500 uniques in just under 2 hours. It's quite an honor to get written about there - hopefully some of the new visitors will stick around and become members. I'll try to write something comprehensive about the traffic levels and server load, etc. tomorrow along with the fringe benefits (other blogs picking us up, etc). ANOTHER UPDATE: Up over 20,000 unique visitors for the day, and the site's running like a champ. Thanks again to the folks who contributed and helped out with this one (and the amazing SEO community that has made me feel welcome from day one). Copied! Back to Top",
