By: Rishi Lakhani September 24, 2007 Google to Announce a New Set of APIs Towards a More Open Social Community Social Media This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. When Google does something new, or even if there are rumours of Google introducing something new, I get this weird mixture of goose pimples and butterflies in the stomach. And those who know me know how addicted I am to all things Facebook. I would love for it to be an all encompassing application – in fact, I think Facebook should have its own unique browser where all my Facebook activities are being pinged on one tab, while I use the other tabs for various online activities (I would love to have an eBay account directly linked to Facebook and use either Google-based search from my profile or create a distinct search facility). I know, I know, I dream… But – I came across the following post: http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/21/google-to-out-open-facebook-on-november-5/ . Goose pimples, butterflies, anxiety – and then I came across the paragraph below: \"And that is a potentially killer strategy. Facebook has a platform to allow third parties to build applications on Facebook itself. But what Google may be planning is significantly more open - allowing third parties to both push and pull data, into and out of Google and non-Google applications.\" Its hard enough being an SEO, but I wonder what sort of mutants these new APIs will create? I am sure, like most of what the Big G does, it will be interesting, and I totally understand where they are coming from, but it does worry me that pretty soon I will have to hire a whole team of application / widget designers to keep up with the market. Nor is the above the only rumour about Google boosting their Social Media strategies: http://mashable.com/2007/09/23/google-earth-social-network/ - this reminds me of the August entry http://mashable.com/2007/08/21/unype-facebook-application/... I am not a big fan of Orkut – compared to FB, I think it’s clumsy, too reminiscent of www.hi5.com … I mean, I totally agree with point 1: https://moz.com/blog/dear-google. I hope that the new applications (if the rumours are true) will be fun and engaging... although this would not ease the guilt I would feel if I migrated from Facebook... Well, it seems I should create an Orkut profile, just in case…. Copied! Back to Top",
