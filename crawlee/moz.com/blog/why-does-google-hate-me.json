V By: Vinny Goldsmith April 26, 2007 Why does Google hate me? Search Engines This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Well, not me specifically - but my MySpace page. A few months back I googled the title of my MySpace page. Just out of curiosity. Surprisingly, I was in the #1 position. I say it was surprising because the title of the page is \"Unattached and Unavailable.\" Those are two common words that actually appear often enough online that you wouldn't think a MySpace page would rank in the number 1 spot. Especially with all of its implied supplemental indexness, A week later, I went to investigate further and surprise again - I had been dropped from at least the first few pages. I would say that is to be expected with the supposed quality of the MySpace domain neighborhood. Except this time, the number one position was the MySpace page of a friend of mine. Why did she rank for this key term? Because the term showed up on her page as a link back to my MySpace profile. If Google is counting those links and anchor text, then obviously all of my friends on MySpace who link back to me should add to my ranking for that term. But that doesn't seem to be the case. I would like to think this is just some loophole in the algorithm, but I can't think of what it possibly could be. I ranked high at one time and now I don't rank at all. Obviously, I'm not trying to optimize my MySpace page for a keyword term. I don't have any long term monetization strategy to capitalize on the keyword term \"Unattached and Unavailable.\" But the fact remains - Google overlooks my page and goes straight to a page that links to me. And I can think of only one reason why that might be happening: Google hates me. Copied! Back to Top",
