October 20, 2008 YOUmoz NBA TweetK9 Fantasy League Social Media \"Where amazing happens.\" - one social media pundit, when asked to describe the TweetK9 Fantasy League. Welcome to the social media extravaganza known as the NBA TweetK9 Fantasy League. What you need to know about the NBA TweetK9 Fantasy League: Over the course of the NBA regular season, up to 12 search and social media marketers will battle it out for the highly coveted title of \"best-fantasy-baller-that-does-online-marketing\" by participating in a Yahoo NBA fantasy league. The participants will draft their own squad of players in a live draft format and then battle one opponent each on a weekly basis. The head-to-head format sums up the performance of two opposing teams in multiple statistical categories, with the winning teams assuming bragging rights while the losing team consoles themselves with their best excuses, at least until the next week. We're currently looking to flesh out the league to a full 12 players, so check out the details and sign up before the live draft. Your League All-Stars (to date) [Player name - Team Name - Twitter handle] Jon Kelly - \"Stars\" @jonkelly Casey Yandle - \"IT'S IN THE GAME\" @cyandle Lucas Ng - \"H-Town Wariers\" @lucasng Mike Motherwell - \"Mother Knows Best\" @motherwell Will Critchlow - \"Euston Power\" @willcritchlow Todd Mintz - \"Go Blazers\" @toddmintz Veezy - \"Cookie Monsters\" David Hamel - \"DaveH\" @davidhamel Andy Jamieson - \"High off the glass\" @andyjamo Marshall England - \"Say Chowdah\" @marshallengland Matthew Brown - \"UPS Truck\" @MatthewJBrown ? How you can participate: Grab a Yahoo account. Get on Twitter, the preferred medium for exchanging manly genteel banter. Be a fairly seasoned fantasy league player [as you'll want to set aside an hour each week to setup your roster and a few hours for the live draft] Why should you join? You'll be part of a highly social league that will be 'interacting' online via Twitter, blogs and email. If you love NBA fantasy basketball and making fun of other people social media, you don't want to be sitting on the bench for this one. Besides, this year is shaping up to be one of the greatest in NBA history, so if you stopped following the NBA in the dark days of the Pistons-Spurs finals, this is the perfect way to catch up with the current league. How much does it cost? Nothing! Except for your online pride and reputation - but you never cared about that anyway, right? What do I get if I win the league? The winner of the league will get their own hardcover tome of legendary NBA coach John Wooden's \"Wooden on Leadership\", the inspiration for Matt McGee's terrific SEO Success Pyramid. What if I don't play fantasy basketball? You can still follow the league as the players will be on Twitter all season long, trading trash talk that would make the bastard child of Gary Payton and Muhammad Ali proud.
