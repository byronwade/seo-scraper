By: Scott Willoughby June 8, 2007 The SMX Diaries Special Edition: The SEOmoz Party The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Tuesday night, following the close of the inaugural SMX here in Seattle, SEOmoz threw a party for our Premium Members, Friends and Colleagues. Our Members got to bowl, play pool, mingle and kick back a few drinks with some of the biggest names in Search including Tim Mayer, Matt Cutts, Greg Boser, Bruce Clay, Todd Malicoat, Jim Boykin, Vanessa Fox, Jen Slegg, Michael McDonald, Lisa Barone, Todd Friesen, and many more, including the one-and-only Danny Sullivan. A great time was had by all and I've thrown together this little video photo-montage to document the occasion for those who couldn't make it and those that had a few too many while there. Don't worry, Rebecca will still be doing her famous conference comics, but not until she gets back from SES Toronto. Thank you to all of those who helped make our party and SMX such fantastic events. It was incredible to see everyone, especially on our home turf, here in the Emerald City. Special thanks to Becky Ryan and Ciaran Norris, from whom I pilfered many of the pictures. Cheers!
