T By: Tyler Y April 17, 2009 Page Title Pandemonium with Amazon Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Well, SEOmoz, I am going to come out of the shadows today. I have been lurking and learning without contributing for quite some time. While far from an expert, I know only enough to be dangerous. An issue arose when analyzing my companies feed to Google Shopping. We were sending two automotive related feeds to them, a part type feed and a year make model feed. Over the weekend Google decided it only wanted one feed and deactivated everyone’s account who was sending multiple feed types. Myself and my closest competitors lost our status until Wednesday, when our new feed was processed and posted. The point of this article is that the ranking in Google shopping had changed drastically from what I could tell. My website was suddenly appearing on the second and third page of Google Shopping and consistently the industry leader in my field was appearing at the top. Amazon was also appearing quite consistently at the top for relevancy. Amazon was sending Google their page title tag as the title for the part number searched. This title tag violates all best practice from what I have read. A bloated 111 to 127 characters present in the title tag made me wonder how they ranked so well for this particular part number. In a search on Google Web Search as opposed to Google shopping they raked 4th for the term \"edelbrock 1406\" in the organic search rankings on Google. I was always under the impression that bloated title tags would get you devalued at Google. My only assessment is that the title tag and the H1 header were exactly the same, the text on page was pretty consistent and Amazon is Amazon. Generally, in the Automotive field it's easy to come up organically for brand and part number combination searches on Google, but I would have thought this page title would devalued them. Any thoughts from the Mozzers? I hope my first post was mildly interesting. Thank you all for your wonderful knowledge -- I have really enjoyed reading your contributions.
