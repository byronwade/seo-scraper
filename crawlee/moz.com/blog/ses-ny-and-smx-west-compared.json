But, from my perspective, both events have compelling reasons to visit: SES NY Is a huge corporate-style trade show Has a lot of folks trying hard to sell to each other Gives you a great view of the competition And may get you access to potential clients SMX West Is the best search marketing community event I've ever attended Lets you rub elbows with lots of search luminaries Was tons of fun Or, as I Tweeted earlier today, SMX West has backpacks, SES NY has shoulder bags. Personally, I'd go to both if you can afford it. If you can't, then I suggest you attend SMX West if you want to get 'in tune' with the search world and learn as much in the bar as you do in sessions.
