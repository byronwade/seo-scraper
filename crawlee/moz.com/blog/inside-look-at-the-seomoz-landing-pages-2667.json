M By: Mark Barrera August 22, 2007 Inside Look at the SEOmoz Landing Pages Moz News This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I was stumbling around the net today and ran across one of the SEOmoz PPC ads. I remembered reading a post by Rand recently talking about a Premium Member Landing Page Contest and wanted to see if it was going on so I clicked the ad to see the landing page. After doing so, I looked around to see if I could find these different landing pages and was able to find 9 different landing pages. I am not sure if this is all of them or not, but I thought I would share them for all to see and get everyone to pick out their favorites. Here are the pages that I found: Landing Page 1 Landing Page 2 Landing Page 3 Landing Page 4 Landing Page 5 Landing Page 6 Landing Page 7 Landing Page 8 Landing Page 9 I think it is interesting to see the differences in the different pages and all the different approaches that were taken. I, personally, like landing page #7. I don't know if the contest actually occurred, or what the status is of these pages. I do know that the original post announcing this contest said that the contest results would be announced the week of August 14th (the last day of the contest) but I haven't seen anything published yet. Hopefully we will hear something soon and see how this landing page test worked out for the MOZ. Which landing pages do you think converted the best? ~Mark Barrera Copied! Back to Top",
