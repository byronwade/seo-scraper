O By: Oatmeal March 8, 2007 Put Your Best Foot Forward: 19 Gorgeous Website Footers Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Footers usually repeat the primary navigation and contain anything that is considered \"the fine print,\" such as copyright information and a privacy policy. With the rising popularity of standards based design, they also have become the home for xhtml and css compliance badges. While doing a redesign for a new client of mine whose website lacked a footer entirely, it occurred to me how footers had become a faint afterthought when I put together a design. My footers are typically content barren and don't get a whole lot of design love. The most content-rich footer I ever created was probably for Avatar Financial, which contained a miniature site map and a bit of contact information. This made me curious - what are other designers doing with their footers? Below is a list of 19 sites I gathered from around the web who have footers that caught my eye. Some are aesthetically pleasing, some offer atypical forms of navigation and functionality, and some just plain work well. I linked directly to as many of the footers as I could, but some of them didn't have ID attributes so you'll have to scroll down. Finding these was actually quite a bit more difficult than I thought it would be, so if anyone knows of any other sites with killer footers please share them in the comments below. Copied!
