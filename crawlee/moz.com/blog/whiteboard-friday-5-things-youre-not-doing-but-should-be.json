By: Scott Willoughby February 25, 2010 Whiteboard Friday - 5 Things You're Not Doing (But Should Be) The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. This week, we've got a couple of newcomers to Whiteboard Studios! Our very own Jen Lopez and Danny Dover (whom you should know well thanks to Jen's Meet the Mozzers post) are pinch-hitting for our globe-trotting CEO. Let's all give them a big welcome. We did a PRO Site Review Webinar last week and noticed a few SEO issues that are all-too-common. So, in this week's Whiteboard Friday, Jen and Danny will walk you through five common areas where people often make mistakes, and explain quick fixes that can help you improve, including bot blocking, courting the Linkerati, identifying problems using Top Pages, analyzing conversion rate, and addressing canonicalization. Here are the charts Danny referenced in the video: Courtesy of WebsiteOptimization.com Also, if you'd like to learn more about tracking first-touch attribution in your analytics, Whiteboard Friday alumnus, Will Critchlow, wrote about it here. Addition: Rand wrote a more in-depth post about the use of robots.txt vs. meta noindex, follow here, which can help shed some light on the subject. Copied! Back to Top",
