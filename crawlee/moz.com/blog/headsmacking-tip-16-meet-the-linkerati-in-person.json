By: Rand Fishkin November 11, 2009 Headsmacking Tip #16: Meet the Linkerati in Person Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. We all know about the Linkerati by now - how to identify them, how they're segmented and why they're the secret to SEO. Yet, time and again, I see link builders and companies pass up amazing opportunities to earn links and attention from those who have the best ability to help your content/brand spread virally. I'll lay out two scenarios below to help illustrate this point: Scenario 1: Emailing a Prominent Blogger/Writer/Journalist/Site Owner/Social Media Personality/Etc. Hoping for a Link You/your company: Identify a list of Linkerati that may be relevant/interested in your business/content Send a carefully crafted email to each individual, hoping to attract their attention and interest Follow up with those who reply (and maybe those who don't) with emails or even a phone call Request a review of your product/tool/site/idea Scenario 2: Meeting that Same Person First, then Following Up You/your company: Identify prominent (or even relatively less known) Linkerati in your city or at an event you're attending Schedule a meeting / invite them to coffee or to tour your offices (or even just go to an event you know they'll be at) Introduce yourself politely and humbly and mention you're a fan. Exchange business cards, have a chat and let them know what you do (also helps if you can find some non-work related topics to bond on as well) Follow up with an email thanking them for the meeting and asking if they'd take a look at your product/tool/site/idea I'd argue that while Scenario 1 is more scalable, it's also potentially damaging in the long run. When you first introduce your work to someone who can help it spread, you have that single chance to make a first impression. If the relationship matters and you're seeking a high \"conversion rate\" for attracting attention from the Linkerati, use Scenario 2. The beauty of these links is that they not only create value for SEO, but often attract second-order effects like increased brand awareness, links/tweets from the followers & fans of the Linkerati, and improved odds that you'll be positively remembered and introduced when someone mentions they need \"X\" (whatever it is your product/tool/site/idea does). In-person connections have always been powerful attractors of value for me in the SEO, social media and startup worlds and when I see early stage (and mature, later-stage companies) engage in this fashion, it's almost always positive. Just make sure you're professional, candid, friendly and never over-bearing in your interactions; chances are you'll get much more than a link. Copied! Back to Top",
