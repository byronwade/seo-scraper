By: Rand Fishkin November 8, 2007 Whiteboard Friday - \"Pardon The Fookin' Interruption\" (The Complete Trilogy) Whiteboard Friday The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. This week, one of the UK's most infamous & brilliant search marketers joined us at the mozplex for what is surely one of the most valuable, insightful and lengthy Whiteboard Friday's we've had. In many ways, it's not too dissimilar from an SMX or Pubcon panel featuring the inimitable Mr. Naylor, and as usual, Dave parts with more information than you might expect. Part I (7:38): Dave & Rand discuss the Google PageRank update (see Mel's data here), Techmeme (sorry for dropping the f-bomb in there) and new features for Google's Webmaster Central. Part II (6:17): We cover secondary signals that Google may or may not use in the rankings equation and Dave describes how his Zippy search engine's AdSense account was eventually banned. This is also the segment where Dave says \"All you mozzers who want to be Black Hats, yeah...\" I'll let the video speak for the rest. Part III (8:17): Dave & Rand discuss Dave Dugdale's recent videos on Rentvine.com - Paid Links & Google Buys Zillow - and whether links to those videos should help his site's rankings. Dave also uses the whiteboard to show us the link graph for temporal analysis. Aplogies for the lengthy videos, but I promise these are worth 20 minutes out of your Friday. Enjoy! p.s. Extra kudos to Scott for his hard work on this. He's put in the equivalent of three days worth of efforts to make this happen, and it's greatly appreciated. If Scott leaves a post in the comments here, make sure to show your thumblove, as I've hijacked the authoring of the post :) p.p.s. Ack! I'd be remiss if I didn't also give a huge thank you to Jeff Pollard for his work on the new SEO Services Marketplace. Jeff, you're a champ. Copied! Back to Top",
