By: Rand Fishkin March 1, 2006 Matt Cutts & the Cuttlets SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. In the evening forum tonight, Danny hilariously referred to Matt's band of followers (who literally swarm around him after sessions like fruitflies at the buffet) as \"Cuttlets\". I saw Aaron and Vanessa from Google laughing in the back of the room and the audience was largely in stitches, too. That is, apart from those who huffed and puffed and acted like they weren't \"Cuttlets\" themselves...Danny's point was really that folks should be paying that much attention to the Google Local people, the Yahoo! MyWeb people and other vertical players. I'd have to agree - everything about this conference screams changes in market share to me. Google's natural SERPs may be a big focus now, but there are other sources of traffic, and many of them are going to be serving up some highly qualified, highly motivated searchers. I have to think that Cuttletting is, currently, at its Apex.People should also think about \"Nayloring\" if they can track Dave down. He's got to be the guy with the best pulse on the technical side of search - always amazed when I talk to him. Copied! Back to Top",
