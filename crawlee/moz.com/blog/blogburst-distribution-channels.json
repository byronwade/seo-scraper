By: Rand Fishkin March 9, 2006 BlogBurst Distribution Channels Content Marketing The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I stumbled onto (yes, literally with the StumbleUpon toolbar) Blogburst today and was relatively impressed with their content partners. The idea is that you submit your blog and the content (if accepted) gets fed to large publishers like the Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News (and possibly others). I've signed up SEOmoz to give it a spin. Does anyone have experience with this or other, similiar networks? Do you think the future involves major publishers leveraging blog content on their sites? Oh, and, why, pray tell, is the Ladder Project one of their featured blogs?
