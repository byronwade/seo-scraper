M By: MikePiper September 22, 2008 Joomla Users: Stop Wasting Your Link Juice On-page SEO This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. As we've all learned, controlling the flow of link juice within your site is an excellent way to help promote your higher-quality pages within Google's rankings. One of the best ways to do this is to add nofollow tags to links in your navigation that are for pages you really don't want to waste link juice on (Privacy Policy, About page, Contact Us, etc). Unfortunately, until now, that has proved rather difficult using Joomla. (Or, to be more up-front, I hadn't even heard of any ways to do it.) However, earlier this month, Steve Burge over at Alledia released a new menu module that allows you to create nofollow links. I just wanted to point it out briefly in case any regular Joomla users had missed it. :-) I can say that I've tried it out, and within 5 minutes of having downloaded it, it was working exactly as described. And I have to say, I'm quite excited about this. Previously, I could do nothing but shake my head at having PR 4 \"Contact\" and \"Privacy Policy\" pages. What a waste.
