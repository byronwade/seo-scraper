By: Rand Fishkin December 8, 2006 Signal to Noise Ratio at SEOmoz - Please Add your Votes & Comments Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I've had several folks mention that they believe the ratio of high-quality posts at SEOmoz has declined over the last several months. I'd like to get a determination from the community as to your opinions about the amount of content and the relative levels of value provided. As we roll out a new version in the next few weeks, we have some options about how to structure the content to allow you to control what you are exposed to, so it's a great time to vote in a poll on the subject and provide feedback. After we've collected some information on this topic, I might post another poll asking about which kinds of content you most enjoy and what you'd like to see take a hike. Thanks for your participation on this post; we'll do our best to make the SEOmoz blog the best possible resource it can be. Please give this poll your most honest answer and feedback, even if it's harsh - it's better that we get hammered now and feel a bit sad than keep producing content that our readers don't truly appreciate. Thanks, in advance, for your candor. Copied! Back to Top",
