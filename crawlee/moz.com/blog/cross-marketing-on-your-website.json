E By: EGOL August 25, 2005 Cross Marketing on Your Website Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I've seen a lot of great comments here at seomoz.org since Rand turned on the comment buttons. I'd like to challenge all of the members to do a little brain storming on cross marketing. How can you make money selling \"Product A\" on a website that is all about \"Topic B\"? I'll give an example below and I ask you to comment with another idea on how this might work. It might open up some creative thinking in all of us.Let's imagine that we run an affiliate program for \"weight loss products\" (Product A). What kind of site (Topic B) might be able to effectively market this product?Here are a list of possible \"Topic B's\" that quickly come to my mind....Swim Suits (get a few pounds off so my gut doesn't show - lol)Weddings (wedding photos get saved and shared for generations!)Beaches (same reason as swim suits)Vacation Destinations (especially if you dress skimpy there)High School Reunion (gotta look good for the old flames)Dating (you have not told her your weight yet - or you lied!)There's six to get us started. Maybe you can add a couple more for weight loss. Or give us six good matches for a Product or Topic of your choice.I think that this will be a fun activity and am looking forward to seeing your best ideas. Copied! Back to Top",
