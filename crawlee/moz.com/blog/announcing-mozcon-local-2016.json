Local SEO | SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Editor's note: Hoping to attend a future Moz Conference? We'd love to see you! Looking to level up your local marketing and SEO skills? Join us in Seattle for MozCon Local, Thursday and Friday, February 18-19. With both an all-day conference and a half-day workshop, you'll hear from top local speakers on topics critical to local marketing, including local link building, app search, mobile optimization, content creation, and so much more. For those who attended LocalUp Advanced last year, this is its newest iteration. For Friday's main show, we'll have a full day of speakers giving in-depth presentations with tons of actionable tips. Whether you're an in-house or agency marketer, a Yellow Pages publisher, or a consultant, you'll come away with a long to-do list and new knowledge. Plus, you'll be able to interact directly with speakers both during Q&A sessions and around the conference, and spend time getting to know your fellow local marketers. We've teamed with our friends at Local U again to bring you in-depth workshops on Thursday afternoon. If you have specific questions and needs for your clients or local marketing, they'll be able to dive into the details, give advice, and address issues unique to your business. For those of you who attended last year's LocalUp, you'll remember the great Q&A sessions. Local U is planning a couple different tracks from agency management to recommended tools, which will be a blast. Buy your MozCon Local 2016 ticket! Some of our great speakers (more coming!)
