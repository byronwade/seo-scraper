G By: GeoffreyF67 March 2, 2007 Using a Public E-Mail Address? Perhaps You Should Rethink That Strategy Blogging This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Are you using an e-mail address for your business that people can easily get? Is it listed off your web page? Perhaps you've gone a step further and used a bit of javascript to obsfucate it so that bots can't crawl and find that link? Think that's enough? Well, think again... I just received a link spam e-mail today that wanted me to exchange links for my site: index-it.net. Oddly enough, I don't own that domain. So my first thought was - COOL - a new form of spam and this one is truly evil. I could register a new domain and put someone else's contact info in that domain. Wouldn't be hard to do and would cost me less than a dollar. So why would I want to do something like that? Well, let's assume for a moment that I'm a really evil black hat fellow and one of my competitors is outperforming me. I happen across this article that tells me that in 2001 (a long time ago in internet years) people spent an hour of every day with irrelevant e-mails. And these were e-mails that were work related! What if I could increase that number to, oh, say TWO HOURS! And what if it only took me less than 30 minutes to do this? Score! I've got an evil-henchmen-type-of-plan all setup now. Here's what I can do...assuming, again that I'm a really evil black hat fellow... Go register two domains. Make sure that I can get mail forwarding with the first. Use my contact info on both domains initially. Go make a post on usenet using the first domain. Sign up for a few article distribution lists. These have lots of e-mails sent out every day! Sign up for one FFA list or three if you've got the time. Thus far, all of the e-mail has been directed to the first domain. Check that e-mail, verify that you really want the e-mail sent to you and change it so that forwarding is now going to the second domain. Change the second domain contact info so that e-mails now go to the competitor. Voila! You're now wasting lots of their time by trying to deal with the flood of crap that they're going to receive. Of course, I wouldn't do that since I'm not a really evil black hat right? :) Avoiding this type of spam is actually rather trivial. All you need to do is make sure that your e-mail address is not publically avaiable. Yes, that even means your support e-mail address. Of course, just removing your e-mail address from your site isn't going to make you very popular when people want support. So I would recommend using a page like this so that people can still contact you. A support desk system of some type would be vastly helpful - not only to avoid the e-mail spam but also in communicating with your customers. That, however, is a topic for another discussion. G-Man P.S. If you know my e-mail address don't be evil like me :) Copied! Back to Top",
