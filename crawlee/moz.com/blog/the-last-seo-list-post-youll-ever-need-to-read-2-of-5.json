D By: DavidChase89 April 11, 2007 The Last SEO List Post You'll Ever Need To Read (2 of 5) Search Engines This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. It’s easy to get lost in all the noise. Many people read re-hashed information and put themselves in a state of paralysis following what everybody else says to do. Ask yourself your own questions; your brain is wired to find the right answers specific to your needs. No blogger, internet marketing guru, or \"seo chief master\" can give you better feedback than you can give yourself. Once I stopped “searching” and started “doing,” I began to have a lot more success. Anyway, here’s (2 of 5): 2. The Synergistic Power of Organic Rankings and Paid Search By David Chase There are many benefits to running paid advertising simultaneously with your search engine optimization campaign. I think I used the phrase an “inescapable priority” on (1 of 5), and I’d say that same phrase is apt for this approach as well. Benefits to running PPC simultaneous with SEO: It eliminates the “guess” when it comes to keyword research, and turns your research and seo methodology into a science. It gives you precise search quantity on any given search query. You no longer need to guess how many times people type in “shoes for sale;” you learn exactly how many times they do. You discover hundreds of relevant search queries based off broad keyword bidding. More importantly, you learn exactly what converts. You discover the language your visitors use when they research, or buy. This is awesome for article ideas (linkbait anybody?), and creating landing pages you previously wouldn’t have thought of. Learning the language your traffic uses - during their purchase decision - is a very invaluable driver for your entire search campaign. Website search tools do a good job at aiding you in this process as well. (I like Google Mini) You also get to serve hundreds of customized ads in front of your most targeted/valuable traffic; you learn how they respond to any given set of Ad Copy. Does it generate a click? A conversion? Higher Page Views per Visit (P/V)? All of the above? You can use this copy to convert traffic in ezine and banner advertising, email marketing, affiliate marketing, and any other forms of traffic building strategies you decide to deploy. We haven’t even gotten to the benefits of occupying more real-estate on Google’s SERPS. Numerous studies have shown that those utilizing effectively (e.g. ranking naturally for and bidding on keywords) both natural and paid search improve the likelihood they’ll be clicked on by more than the sum of their single probabilities. (the synergy) e.g. 1+1 = 2.8 Where I’m ranked in top 3 organically and bidding for a premium position on Adwords - my own testing shows 65% greater chance for the click. (This percentages comes from hundreds of thousands of ad-serves with copy that has been notoriously tested and optimized for high clickthrough rates - this number will vary based off many factors.) Not only is owning two spots (3 spots greatly enhances the effect as well) on Google's SERPS great for dramatically increasing the likelihood of pulling in the traffic for that keyword anytime it's inquired, but my own studies show that having double ads on Google SERPS increases conversion rates by up to 200%. That's major. How do you set it up? Simply duplicate your current public landing pages (pages that have your most important keywords). Make these pages private by not linking to them from your public site, and using a noindex in your robots.txt. Create adgroup(s) designated to target these new private page(s). Add all relevant keywords to the adgroups. (You can't turn your head without a guide on keyword research, use many of the well referenced stuff out there.) Make sure to bid broad, exact, and phrase initially, and use a log analyzer to find out the exact terms people are using to find that page. I like Web Log Expert. Continually add all keywords to the adgroup as they become available through your tracking tools. Constantly split-test between 3 different pieces of AdCopy; use your best performing Ad Copy in the meta description of your public page. Make sure to use the “no odp” tag, so Google will serve the description you designate (the description you manually enter in the meta description). Here is how to apply the no odp tag: <META NAME=\"ROBOTS\" CONTENT=\"NOODP\"> <META NAME=\"msnbot\" CONTENT=\"NOODP\"> <META NAME=\"googlebot\" CONTENT=\"NOODP\"> Use the PPC data to delegate the rest of your SEO campaign: If PPC says “keyword A” converts, then make sure you have a public page on your site for “keyword A.” Then, work hard as hell to get that page ranked. If PPC says “keyword B” doesn’t convert and it gets marginal traffic, than it might be best to noindex that page so that you don’t leak your domain authority on pages/keywords that don’t pull in targeted enough traffic. By noindexing pages that aren’t doing anything to directly increase conversions on your site, you naturally put more authority on pages you are allowing Google to index. I’ll explain this in more detail in another article. I think this is enough information to get those started who don’t currently have PPC on their radar. 3 of 5 will cover all areas of content syndication, including press releases and how to increase the likelihood your content gets published by major publications.
