By: Rishi Lakhani September 20, 2007 Spotting Opportunities to go Viralâ€¦ Social Media This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Recently this well known guy wrote this post. Its kinda like a very friendly outlook to what else you can use Google for. I must admit, in the past I have typed in telephone numbers into Google, if I received a dropped (missed) call and if they looked suspicious – saved me a few quid because some of them turned out to be premium numbers and needless to say, I didn’t try calling them. But I digress. One of the great things about SEM is that you can use some really creative content, and sometimes the simplest ideas are some of the best (take an offline example; the Cadbury’s Gorilla) Funnily enough, a colleague recently forwarded me a link to the following UK site: http://www.notgoinganywhere.co.uk. What a great concept! It would have fitted in perfectly with the post – its relevant, interesting, not branded, and easy to use. But what it does do – is get me talking (and hence link to) about it – effect 1. And when people do enter their details to join the campaign – the site harvests their email address - effect 2. Now I am anxious to see how the site develops, and as a result my details are in their database. But if this site was launched to work with the post Matt made above, and let's say someone posted a link on the comments forum, I am sure it would have picked up pace fairly quickly. In a nutshell, the point I am making is that one way to run a Viral Campaign, is to keep abreast of the news, note interesting comments others make, spot opportunities where they exist, and take advantage of them.
