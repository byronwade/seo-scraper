Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin July 1, 2005 Dear DMOZ Forum Visitors Blogging The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I notice 3 unique DMOZ threads that are sending quite a few visitors to SEOmoz today. I want to welcome and thank all of the editors there who've made their way over. We may have our differences, but I realize that most of you are doing a great job organizing and classifying sites and maintaining what is still the best directory available. Hopefully, you're not too upset over my bribery recommendations. I trust that despite our differences, we can at least agree to disagree on these types of issues. I would like to make one suggestion - Wikipedia's public discussions over content, links, etc. has made them an exceptional resource and one that is arguably unassailable. I highly urge DMOZ to make the same shifts in their own decision making policy. Transparency in public Internet organizations is a great thing and can really help to shift webmasters' image of the DMOZ hierarchy. Enjoy SEOmoz and drop me a line if you'd like. I'm always up for enlightened discussion. Copied! Back to Top",
