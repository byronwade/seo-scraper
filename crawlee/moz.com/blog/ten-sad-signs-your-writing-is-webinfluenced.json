I was thinking of checking it out.\" \"Did you watch the Tigers game last night? They pulled off a close one ftw.\" \"I'm not sure when I'll be able to stop by, but I'll AIM to be there by eight.\" \"I'm planning to make a lot of food for the party, so I'd really appreciate it if you could come over early and mashup the potatoes while I prep the turkey.\" The death of the written word, ladies and gentlemen!
