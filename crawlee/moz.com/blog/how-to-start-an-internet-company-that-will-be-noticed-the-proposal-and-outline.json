By: Danny Dover February 18, 2009 How to Start an Internet Company That Will Be Noticed: The Proposal and Outline Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Update 7-29-09: I have decided to put this series on hold for a while. I will continue it once I get more time to experiment with the ideas before recommending them. I am sure both of us can appreciate that :-p Cheers! This post is a little different than what you might be used to. Instead of talking at you, I would like to talk with you. I would like to propose a blogging outline, not actually blog on the given subject (yet!). First, allow me to explain myself. I have been under-utilizing my blogging privileges the last three months and I would like to try to make this up to all of you. I have made the same excuses that everyone makes. “I am too busy,” “I’ll get to it later,\" “My dog ate my keyboard.” I know these are bad excuses (except the last one) and so do you. There are plenty of people who work many more hours than I do (i.e., Rand) and even more people who write excellent blog posts who have less material to work with than me. The truth is, I love blogging! It is my favorite part of my “job” and quite possibly the aspect that has taught me the most about the internet. Every time I post, I eagerly read the comments and obsessively follow the conversation if it travels around the internet. Here is the part that involves you. I would like to write posts only about material that you want to read about. Below is my proposal for you. If you choose not to accept it, I would love to hear your feedback so that I can be led in the right direction. My Blog Proposal: You wouldn’t start an offline company without considering marketing, yet many people try to start online companies without considering internet marketing and SEO. I want to start an internet company and document the entire process from an internet marketing perspective. There are plenty of blogs about about starting a company, but very few (if any) that explain how to do it while solely focusing on internet marketing. I will not include general start up advice. Instead, I will write as if I am the SEO manager whose only job is to do SEO for the company. To be perfectly honest, I do plan on trying to make money from the company but it is not my main concern. I have acquired a lot of internet marketing knowledge over the past year and I feel like if I don’t start applying it soon, I will explode! This is my effort to stop thinking and start doing. Blogging Outline: This is not a definitive plan. It is not tested yet and I plan to try these ideas out and blog about the results. I have only started one company in my life and it ended in a scary legal battle. I do not claim to be even a moderately skilled entrepreneur, but I do have enough SEO skills to make a notable attempt. Below is my plan: (Each category will be at least one blog post.) Formulating the idea What marketable problem does the idea solve? Who will want to visit your site What will they be able to accomplish Unique Selling Proposition (Thanks, Dr. Mani) What \"unfair\" advantage do you have over your competition to make you better than them Identify two degrees of difference How will your content build links? Who will write your unique content How will this website do if it only has 100 users? Know the space before you get into it Identify the thought leaders and Linkerati Understand the internet neighborhood and the neighboring internet neighborhoods Socialize in the space Identify user wants and needs Find inspiration (aesthetic design, ideas, concepts) The art of stealing ideas (It’s fine to steal little pieces from different websites. Give credit where credit is due) Keyword research Start early and design with flexibility in mind Run test PPC campaigns (Thanks KS-Katz) Identify themes Decide how this will affect your design Setting goals What do you want to rank competitively for Is your online marketing plan primarily: Social Media, Paid Search or Natural Search Is there a goal to marketing other then selling the product 1 hour of marketing for every two hours of coding? Plan Make a flexible outline Think SEO and marketing from the beginning Create an early stage marketing plan Create a high level long term marketing plan (do not expect ANY press) What will you blog about? How many posts per week? Milestones Keep the big picture in mind Get a domain (doesn't even have to be the final. you can always 301) Base on your keyword research and your intuition New domains Domize Identify pros and cons of the domain name early Have a friend spell it without seeing it. (\"Hey Jeff, how would you spell ziontd\") Buy canonicalized versions (.com, .org .net -- others not necessary) Buy typos Remember engines are registrars, so private registration is useless If you need to buy a currently owned domain... Weigh the pros and cons of the title (Is it worth the price? Google, Delicious, Wikipedia are all nonsense words) Use a reputable source Allow 2 months for transfer proceedings Work before the work (Start building links early) Execute your early stage marketing plan Make a blog Host funny images on your server Social media links Local search registration Mockups (include SEO, Info architecture, siloing, H1, title tags) Think scaffolding, not colors Write out your title tags and H1, H2 on your mockups Plan your information architecture (3 click theory) Entire section on navigation How will your homepage spread link juice Establish a clear call to action on every page (Thanks, Jordan) Development design (hardware and middleware) Pick a CMS The SEO pros and cons of going custom HTML formatting (how does it look? how does it parse?) URL structure Bot killers Server administration (Thanks, Darren) Apache vs. IIS The importance of IP addresses DNS management Design design (frontend) User and search engine focused design The 3 Components of web design Interface design Clickability Banana (call to action) CSS Alt tags Aesthetic design UX CSS Branding Information design At this point it should already be planned Now figure out how to implement into design Breadcrumbs? Visual Hierarchy of information Code Start coding SEO audit Get a different SEO to look at your site Nofollow Title tags H1 SEO Browser SEOmoz tools (Term Targeting) Marketing Stunts Blogs Community Social media Paid (YouTube) Tracking/Analytics The infinity loop (This process never ends) SERPS Reputation management / social media tracking That's all I have for right now. I look forward to hearing your opinions and expertise in the comments. As always, e-mail me or send me a private message if you have any suggestions on how I can make my posts more useful. If that's not your style, feel free to contact me on Twitter (DannyDover) and/or Linkedin (Danny Dover). Thanks! Copied! Back to Top",
