By: Jennifer Sable Lopez May 12, 2011 Introducing MozCation: Nominate Your City for an SEOmoz Meetup SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Imagine this if you will… you're sitting in your office in Denver, working away and see a tweet come through your stream about an SEOmoz meetup in New York City. You think to yourself, \"self… why do they always have these meetups so far away? It'd be cool if they came to Denver, we have lots of SEOs here too, yo.\" [that's at least how I talk to myself] Ok… ok so perhaps you've never had that exact situation happen, but perhaps something similar. :) Which is exactly why we came up with the SEOmoz Family MozCation!We're hitting the road, and want to have a meetup in your city! But why? Our community means the world to us, and getting to spend time with you in a small setting is the best way to get to know you. Usually we have a meetup in large cities which we're already visiting because we're speaking at a conference, or something like that. But we're ready to expand our horizons a bit and possibly hit up some smaller cities or places we don't often visit. This is where you come in... Nominate your city for our first meetup on June 29th!But here's the thing, obviously you know your city better than we do. So we're asking you to put together some piece of content to tell us why we should plan a meetup in your town. We want you to get creative here. Nominating your city is easy. Just follow the steps below:1. Create some awesome content to tell us why your city is awesomeTell us why we your city (town, area, whatever) is perfect for a meetup of online marketers. It doesn't matter if it's a big city or a small town, if you're in the United States or Timbuktu. What types of content can you come up with? Get creative, but here are some examples: A video: Show us the sights, get your friends together a do a quick jig, tell the camera why your town is the best. A blog post: Make the case using your brilliant writing skills. Do you have an amazing fountain in your town, is there a great brew pub, do you and your friends meet and talk SEO every single day? A song: Are you musically gifted? Write a song and tell how why we should come to your town. A photo: Is there one perfect shot that explains your city? Can you take a picture of the 30 people who would come? Take it, and link to it! A drawing: Perhaps you're more inclined to draw it out. Show us why the Mozzers should invade your area.You can go in on it with several people in your area to try to combine your efforts even. We're open to going pretty much anywhere and who knows, you may even meet some new people!This is my lame attempt to show there are lots of SEOs in Denver (my hometown). Photo courtesy Rudy Lopez.2. Complete the nomination form with a link to your content:3. Send a tweet to share your nomination with the world!Once the content is created, use the form on the MozCation page to create a nominating tweet. Add the link to your content, the location you'd like us to come to, hit submit, then send the tweet it creates. Bam! You're done. :) And be sure to get friends in your town to tweet (or re-tweet) your link for further consideration! Deadline for nomination is May 24th for our June 29th event! We'll have three meetups throughout the year, so this is just your first chance. You're free to nominate your city each time around. For now though, you have a little less than two weeks to get your content created and your nomination in. So what are you waiting for?? Time is ticking away! The first meetup will be held on Wednesday, June 29th so you won't have to wait too long. :) We Pick The City Once the nominations are closed, we'll go through all the entries and pick the most compelling entry. Remember we're open to going to smaller cities, just give us a good reason why we should! Getting retweets on your submission can help, but it's not a necessity. We're making the final call, so if the best content comes from an entry with 2 tweets, it's all good.What is an SEOmoz Meetup Anyway? Each time we plan a meetup it's slightly different based on the city we'll be in, event location, etc. But normally it runs 2-3 hours, we like to get 2-4 industry leaders to speak to the group, and there's always plenty of food and drinks to go around. We think these are ideal situations to meet with and give back to the community. Most times we'll give away some kind of swag and we'll always have a discount to try out our PRO membership. Questions, Questions and More Questions I know, you have lots of questions right? Check out the official MozCon page for a lot more information and details about the events. But don't think too much about it. :) Create some compelling content telling us why your city is the perfect place for an SEOmoz Meetup, and we'll figure out the rest! We look forward to the nominations and we'll be retweeting some of the best ones we see come through. Now it's time to get crackin' folks and create something awesome. Copied! Back to Top",
