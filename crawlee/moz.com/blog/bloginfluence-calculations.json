By: Rand Fishkin March 16, 2006 BlogInfluence Calculations Content Marketing The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Came across BlogInfluence which purports to give a score to indicate your blog's relative level of importance in the sphere. The rough calculation is based on the number of Technorati and Yahoo! links you've got, added together with Bloglines subscriptions and multiplied by a factor that uses Google's PageRank. It's certainly not a perfect system, but it is interesting and decent to make comparisons with. In many ways, it's a poor man's version of the Quick Strength tool Matt is working on for SEOmoz (as per your requests). SEOmoz's score was 7,027, SERoundtable is at 137,557 and Jim Boykin's got a 6988. I'm losing out because I don't have any Bloglines subscribers (or the tool isn't counting them). Copied!
