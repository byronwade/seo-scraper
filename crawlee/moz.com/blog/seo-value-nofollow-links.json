By: Rand Fishkin October 6, 2017 Getting SEO Value from rel=\"nofollow\" Links Link Building | Whiteboard Friday The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Plenty of websites that make it easy for you to contribute don't make it easy to earn a followed link from those contributions. While rel=nofollow links reign in the land of social media profiles, comments, and publishers, there's a few ways around it. In today's Whiteboard Friday, Rand shares five tactics to help you earn equity-passing followed links using traditionally nofollow-only platforms. Click on the whiteboard image above to open a high-resolution version in a new tab! Video Transcription Howdy, Moz fans, and welcome to another edition of Whiteboard Friday. This week we're going to chat about how you can get SEO value from nofollowed links. So in the SEO world, there are followed links. These are the normal ones that you find on almost every website. But then you can have nofollowed links, which you’ll see in the HTML code of a website. You will see the normal thing is a href=somewebsite in here. If you see this rel=nofollow, that means that the search engines — Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. — will not count this link as passing link equity, at least certainly not in the same way that a followed link would. So when you see these, you can see them by looking in the source code yourself. You could turn on the MozBar and use the \"Show nofollow links\" on the Page button and see these. What sort of links use rel=nofollow? But the basic story is that you're not getting the same SEO value from them. But there are ways to get it. Recently you might have seen in the SEO news world that Inc. and Forbes and a few other sites like them, last year it was Huffington Post, started applying nofollow tags to all the links that belong to articles from contributors. So if I go and write an article for Inc. today, the links that I point out from my bio and my snippet on there, they're not going to pass any value, because they have this nofollow applied. A) Social media links (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) There are a bunch of types of links use this. Social media, so Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, which is one of the reasons why you can't just boost your linked profile by going to these places and leaving a bunch of links around. B) Comments (news articles, blogs, forums, etc.) Comments, so from news articles or blogs or forums where there's discussion, Q&A sites, those comments, all the links in them that you leave again nofollowed. C) Open submission content (Quora, Reddit, YouTube, etc.) Open submission content, so places like Quora where you could write a post, or Reddit, where you could write a post, or YouTube where you could upload a video and have a post and have a link, most of those, in fact almost all of them now have nofollows as do the profile links that are associated. Your Instagram account, for example, that would be a social media one. But it's not just the pictures you post on Instagram. Your profile link is one of the only places in the Instagram platform where you actually get a real URL that you can send people to, but that is nofollowed on the web. D) Some publishers with less stringent review systems (Forbes, Buzzfeed, LinkedIn Pulse, etc.) Some publishers now with these less stringent publishing review systems, so places like Inc., Forbes, BuzzFeed in some cases with their sponsored posts, Huffington Post, LinkedIn's Pulse platform, and a bunch of others all use this rel=nofollow. Basic evaluation formula for earning followed links from the above sources The basic formula that we need to go to here is: How do you contribute to all of these places in ways that will ultimately result in followed links and that will provide you with SEO value? So we're essentially saying I'm going to do X. I know that's going to bring a nofollowed link, but that nofollowed link will result in this other thing happening that will then lead to a followed link. Do X → Get rel=nofollow link → Results in Y → Leads to followed link 5 examples/tactics to start This other thing happening can be a bunch of different things. It could be something indirect. You post something with your site on one of these places. It includes a nofollow link. Someone finds it. We'll just call this guy over here, this is our friendly editor who works for a publication and finds it and says, \"Hmm, that link was actually quite useful,\" or the information it pointed to was useful, the article was useful, your new company seems useful, whatever it is. Later, as that editor is writing, they will link over to your site, and this will be a followed link. Thus, you're getting the SEO value. You've indirectly gained SEO value essentially through amplification of what you were sharing through your link. Google likes this. They want you to use all of these places to show stuff, and then they're hoping that if people find it truly valuable, they'll pick it up, they'll link to it, and then Google can reward that. So some examples of places where you might attempt this in the early stages. These are a very small subset of what you could do, and it's going to be different for every industry and every endeavor. 1. Quora contributions But Quora contributions, especially those if you have relevant or high value credentials or very unique, specific experiences, that will often get picked up by the online press. There are lots of editors and journalists and publications of all kinds that rely on interesting answers to Quora questions to use in their journalism, and then they'll cite you as a source, or they'll ask you to contribute, they'll ask you for a quote, they'll point to your website, all that kind of stuff. 2. Early comments on low-popularity blogs Early comments especially in, I know this is going to sound odd, but low-popularity blogs, rather than high-popularity ones. Why low popularity? Because you will stand out. You're less likely to be seen as a spammer, especially if you're an authentic contributor. You don't get lost in the noise. You can create intrigue, give value, and that will often lead to that writer or that blogger picking you up with followed links in subsequent posts. If you want more on this tactic, by the way, check out our Whiteboard Friday on comment marketing from last year. That was a deep dive into this topic. 3. Following and engaging with link targets on Twitter Number three, following and engaging with your link targets on Twitter, especially if your link targets are heavily invested in Twitter, like journalists, B2B bloggers and contributors, and authors or people who write for lots of different publications. It doesn't have to be a published author. It can just be a writer who writes for lots of online pieces. Then sharing your related content with them or just via your Twitter account, if you're engaging with them a lot, chances are good you can get a follow back, and that will lead to a lot of followed up links with a citation. 4. Link citations from Instagram images Instagram accounts. When you post images on Instagram, if you use the hashtags — hashtag marketing is kind of one of the only ways to get exposure on Instagram — but if you use hashtags that you know journalists, writers, editors, and publications of any kind in your field are picking up and need, especially travel, activities, current events, stuff that's in the news, or conferences and events, many times folks will pick up those images and ask you for permission to use them. If you're willing to give it, you can earn link citations. Another important reason to associate that URL with your site so that people can get in touch with you. 5. Amplify content published on your site by republishing on other platforms If you're using some of these platforms that are completely nofollow or platforms that are open contribution and have follow links, but where we suspect Google probably doesn't count them, Medium being one of the biggest places, you can use republishing tactics. So essentially you're writing on your own website first. Writing on your own website first, but then you are republishing on some of these other places. I'm going to go Forbes. I'm going to publish my column on Forbes. I'm going to go to Medium. I'm going to publish in my Medium account. I'm going to contribute Huffington Post with the same piece. I'm republishing across these multiple platforms, and essentially you can think of this as it's not duplicate content. You're not hurting yourself, because these places are all pointing back to your original. It's technically duplicate content, but not the kind that's going to be bothersome for search engines. You're essentially using these the same way you would use your Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn, where you are pushing it out as a way to say, \"Here, check this out if you're on these platforms, and here's the original back here.\" You can do that with the full article, just like you would do full content in RSS or full content for email subscribers. Then use those platforms for sharing and amplification to get into the hands of people who might link later. So nofollowed links, not a direct impact, but potentially a very powerful, indirect way to get lots of good links and lots of good SEO value. All right, everyone, hope you've enjoyed this edition of Whiteboard Friday, and we'll see you again next week. Take care. Video transcription by Speechpad.com Copied! Back to Top",
