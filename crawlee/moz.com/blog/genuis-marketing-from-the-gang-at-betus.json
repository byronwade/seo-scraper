Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin June 22, 2006 Genuis Marketing from the Gang at BetUS Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I got an email today requesting a link over to a sports betting website. I'm not usually in the business of answering these positively, but I couldn't help but be impressed by their campaign. Check out - Put your Money Where Your Blog is from BetUS. The gist is - you can bet on blog ranks at Technorati thorugh the system by, for example, guessing that on New Year's Eve 2006, Matt Cutts' blog will be ranked #1 at Technorati. The odds against this are 6 to 1, so if you place a $100 bet, you get $600 (and thus, earn $500 in profit). What I love about the scheme is the ingenuity of the concept - it's great linkbait, for one and it also appeals to the right types of emotional elements in the blogosphere. They've created a marketing tool that brings them links, costs very little to run and produces income for the company. I feel like they must be reading from the same viral marketing handbook we've been preaching from. Congrats, gang. BTW - Here's the current odds: Anyone placing bets? Mine's on \"none of the above\" - I'm thinking a new blog will come along to dwarf all of these sometime in the next 6 months. I wouldn't put money on it, but I'm also not planning to place a bet on any of these guys... since I don't run their marketing campaigns :) Copied! Back to Top",
