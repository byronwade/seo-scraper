Table of Contents Copied! By: Erica McGillivray April 24, 2014 The #MozCon 2014 Agenda is Here! SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. *drumroll* ... That's right, friends, the MozCon 2014 Agenda is here! You can now show this to your boss to get that final approval and start making plans for how many notebooks you'll be filling with ideas and tips.

If you're not, you can sign up for a 30-day free trial and get the Pro subscriber MozCon price immediately. Cancel your subscription at any time if it's not for you, and we'll see you at MozCon 2014 either way! Okay, let's talk about just how great this MozCon's going to be. We have topics ranging from technical mobile SEO and A/B testing to \"big content\" idea generation and getting maximum value from your PR efforts. There is truly something for every type of online marketer. We have returning MozCon favorites such as Wil Reynolds, Dr. Pete Meyers, and Nathalie Nahai, as well as new speakers like Kerry Bodine, Cindy Krum, and Jeremy Bloom. Plus, we're trying a new format—a fireside chat—with our CEO Sarah Bird, so we can really dig into what life at Moz has been like since she and Rand switched places. Not to mention all the photos with Roger, the wonderful swag, yummy food, and all the other MozCon trimmings you expect. And yes, we're letting Cyrus Shepard emcee again.
