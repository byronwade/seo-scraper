By: Rebecca Kelley July 12, 2007 Breaking News: Danny Sullivan = Old, Rand Fishkin = Not Old Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Rand was astounded to see that typing in \"rand fishkin birthday\" brought up the following results in Google: Rand's birthday gets a one box result?! WHAAAAA??! The one box result is via Answers.com, which is via a (surprise surprise) Wikipedia entry about Rand. Let's see if any other SEOs get the prestigious one box treatment... We tried other SEOs, to no avail (Barry Schwartz, Chris Sherman, Andy Beal, etc). Is Rand the only SEO special enough to score a one-box result? Finally, a search for \"danny sullivan birthday\" yielded the results we were looking for... Wait, Danny's HOW old?! ...what the hell is \"racing-reference.info\"? Ah, clearly this isn't the Danny Sullivan we know and love. Whew! And sure enough, right under the one box result: I guess Danny's not \"one box\" material, after all... ;) P.S. Obviously, the title of this is directed towards 57-year old racing guy Danny Sullivan, and not the young, hip, spry Danny Sullivan we adore. (Please don't take away my speaking gigs, Danny. Blame Rand, not me!) Copied! Back to Top",
