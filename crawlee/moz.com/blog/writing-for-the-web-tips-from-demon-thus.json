By: Rand Fishkin June 30, 2005 Writing for the Web Tips from Demon @ Thus Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. A website I stumbled across through del.icio.us today, Demon @ Thus, has a great short article on writing for the web. The article covers 10, easy-to-understand points, from which I shall paraphrase: Keep in mind what you want to convey Understand how people read and use the web Be succinct and get to the point Avoid linguistic complexity Break up the text into digestable bits Structure the information architecture content of each piece Be aware of design Provide detail Place objectivity above showmanship Write with a consistent style Since writing for the web is one of the biggest parts of (white hat) SEO, it's probably a subject I will attempt to focus on more here at SEOmoz.
