J By: JoshuaSciarrino August 15, 2008 Learning SEO: A List of SEO Audio Whiteboard Friday This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I've complied a list of audio that will help you learn SEO, ranging from Interviews to Tips and Secrets. Listen to this SEO audio and become an expert in minutes. This is my first YOUmoz post, so be nice. :) And I decided to answer Ciaranj's call. And I'm taking time off my vacation to post this. (I'm from Florida, but I'm on vacation in Colorado, then it's the SEOmoz seminar in Seattle.) I've been researching, reading, and learning SEO the past 4-6 months (I lost track of time). It seems the SEO community is off-balance and I hope this post brings some of the balance back. :) We are great content writers (2, 3, 4, etc). We provide great videos for tips and tricks for SEO (2, 3, 4, etc). And we are great socially (2, 3, 4, 4.1, etc). (Every community has their quarrels and petty fights but overall, we have a great social community. This is a perfect community.) Alright, so we have a fantastic community. But we are off balance. If anyone has taken a college class on 'teaching' or 'how to teach', you would've learned that people learn in DIFFERENT WAYS. I'm primarily a visual learner, so those Whiteboard Friday posts help me out every time. But I've learned that not everyone is a visual learner. So, instead of spending thousands of dollars on classes to learn 'how to teach', let me give you the basics and then (hopefully) balance our SEO community's teaching methods. There are four main styles of learning: Auditory -- Learn through Audio (this post...) Visual -- These people love videos Tactual -- These people learn the most through their notes taken at conferences, speeches, and/or life experiences (from notes...not the experience). Kinesthetic -- Learn by doing. I think most SEO's tend to say, \"This is the way to learn,\" but in truth, this is ONE WAY to learn, not the only. Most of the SEO content online is the latter 3 categories: videos (visual), writings (tactile), and random posts (kinesthetic). So, if you're still having trouble learning SEO or you prefer to learn through Audio, I have made a list for you. :) Some are interviews, while others provide techniques for SEO. VKI Studios interviews Todd Malicoat (Stundubl) Date: May 16, 2008 Length: 45 mins Direct Link Subject: Resource linkbait and Humor linkbait. Resource linkbait could be a list of something (like this!). Humor is....do I really need to explain this? Todd also said these two suggestions are great for LONG-TERM effects. Peter Clayton interview Bruce Clay. Date: April 20, 2007 Length: 22 mins Direct Link Subject: Bruce Clay, the man who coined 'SEO' (according to Danny Sullivan), is interviewed by Peter Clayton. Bruce talks about the beginnings of SEO, his ethics, info about his company, and I think you can pull some great tidbits from it about SEO. John Jantsch interviews Aaron Wall Date: April 12, 2005 Length: 1 hour Direct Link Subject: Targeting Local with SEO (It's really covering all SEO topics for the first half, then it goes specifically 'local seo' in the second half). According to the Kelsey Group, \"70% of US households use internet/search engines for local shopping.\" And \"'50% of search queries are unique,\" Aaron said (citing what he heard from Google in Israel). Near the end I liked how Aaron answered how someone would track online and offline effects. Simply use different phone #'s. Great idea! An SEO theme song (kind of like rap...hey, they tried!) Date: 2007 Length: 2 min, 31 seconds Direct Link Subject: A funny/goofy SEO song. :) Garrett Pierson from Your SEO Mentor interviews Dave Snyder of Snydeysense.com and SearchandSocial.com Date: August 4, 2008 Length: 27 mins Subject: Learning more about Dave Snyder and his SEO mini-con in Florida. I really enjoy his perspective on SEO. He likes it because it DOES CHANGE CONTINUALLY. He's a self learner and self-motivated. Here's just a sloppy list of others (I'm on vacation, folks...): Our own Rand Fishkin gets interviewed An audio interview with Expedia.com SEO manager Chris Alan Vanessa Fox audio interview on SEO and web analytics Ken Jurina and Curtis Dueck from Epiar talk about their negative keyword tool for PPC campaigns 10 simple SEO tips SEO tips from Garrett Pierson A list of audio interviews and podcasts from Bruce Clay A rap video -- for purposes of this post, just listen to the audio and ignore the video part ;) If anyone wants to add some of their audio or interviews, message me and I'll add them.
