Table of Contents Copied! O By: Oatmeal March 1, 2006 New features on SEOmoz Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. As promised, here's a quick run-down of the new features on SEOmoz. Search - This will search the entire site. It needs some fine tuning, but it's effective for the time being. Threaded blog comments - You can now reply to individual comments rather than just the blog entry itself. This should make discussions easier to follow and you shouldn't have to keep quoting each other to keep conversations in context. A touch of AJAX was used to make the whole commenting system easier to use. Email notices of new blog comments - You can now opt to receive emails when someone replies to a blog you are following. If you're worried your inbox will get spammed with notices, It's easy to unsubscribe. There's also an option to automatically follow conversations that you have taken part in - you can adjust this setting under My Account. Suggest a blog entry - Log in and you can send us blog ideas. Improved blog entry navigation. Page (1 .. x) functionality should make browsing blogs a bit easier. SEOmoz is now pure CSS/XHTML. This isn't really a feature to most of you, but it should appease the web development purists. :) Bugs! I temporarily removed the \"keep me logged in\" option. I'll try and have this working soon. HTML glitches, spacing issues, etc. I'm sure there's a few of these floating around, let me know if you find any. The lost password form has vanished! (ooooOooOOhh) Actually I forgot to build it. I'll have it done in a day or so. If you find a bug, email instead of rand, or reply to this post.Coming soon Free SEO Tools - The keyword difficulty tool is the only one that's active right now. Rand and I are going to put together a whole new suite of free SEO tools. They'll make heavy use of AJAX and will be a lot faster than the old tools. TRA (Total Ranking Analysis) tool. For $19 you'll truly be able to buy SEO. Copied! Back to Top",
