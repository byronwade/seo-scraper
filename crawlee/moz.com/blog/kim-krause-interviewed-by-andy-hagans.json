Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin November 4, 2005 Kim Krause Interviewed by Andy Hagans SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Kim's got some very wise words about everything from \"party pooper\" Jakob Nielsen to the obligation of SEO/Ms to give back to the web. It's a solid read: I prefer to question things, test them to see if they work for me, and then test again to see if they meet the needs of end users, and then decide. There are many usability design points that (Nielsen) recommends that do make sense, especially if you want to get the basics down. However, some things that he says are considered Nielsen Gospel, like blue link colors and linking \"home\" from a homepage. There's a sense of guilt or shame whenever someone defies his standards and experiments on their own. I've been part of the Internet-life since 1995. I've played a part in what its doing. At some point I began to question whether or not what I, and my peers are doing, has any real long-term value. What the heck are we making for our kids? Will they want it? Yet, even though I asked the question and wanted to explore some ideas, I don't want to lose the freedom we have to make these choices. In the end, there will be businesses developed that will help us deal with the messes we create. I just got to wondering when people will grow tired of creating them. I noted that in the comments, an irate user of Kim's site is commenting on her own usability. I know that Kim's making that a priority, but when the rest of us are swarming her with contracts, it can be a little tough. Copied! Back to Top",
