Table of Contents Copied! By: Jeremy Dearringer October 10, 2011 What is a Reverse Proxy and How Can it Help My SEO? Technical SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Subdomains! The bane of many SEO-conscious organizations, there is an easy solution right under your nose. By using subfolders in place of subdomains, you can unite your content under one domain.

Multiple CMSs, databases and even platforms can be used, while all appearing to come from the same domain. Check out this infographic to see how reverse proxy technology can relieve your subdomain woes.
