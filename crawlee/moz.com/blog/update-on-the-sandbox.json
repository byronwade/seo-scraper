By: Rand Fishkin August 2, 2005 Update on the Sandbox Blogging The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Many individuals, mostly from SEOChat, having been asking me to update my Google Sandbox articles to include all of the new information, observations and hands-on experience I've got from the past 6 months. I've obliged and have created a new definition and observable phenomenon sheet for the filter, along with a lot of good information for those concerned about the filter affecting them or currently stuck in it. Check out the latest - 2005 Analysis of the Google Sandbox. Even though the sandbox topic occassionally seems tired, even to me, I know there are hundreds if not thousands of webmasters struggling against it. For these people, whose lives have been overrun by this Google filter, I offer my condolences and best wishes. Remember that I'm always happy to receive e-mails about the subject and offer my advice and experience. It's the contribution of folks mired in the problem (or who have found a way to escape) that have made SEOmoz a resource for this epidemic. Copied! Back to Top",
