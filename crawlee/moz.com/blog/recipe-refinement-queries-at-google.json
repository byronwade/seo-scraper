By: Rand Fishkin March 26, 2006 Recipe Refinement Queries at Google Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I couldn't find a good recipe for Chinese Beef & Broccoli at Epicurious this weekend, so I headed to Google, where, lo and behold, they have what appears to be another new feature - query refinement via recipes. I may have just been busy when the search blogs reported on this, but I can't seem to find it in archives at SEW or SERoundtable, either, so maybe it is new.

I'd like to see this test succeed, not because it will make SEO any easier (it will actually pull value into the tail of keyword searches, IMO), but because it makes for a smarter, better search experience. BTW - Check out that last option in the search box... Does anyone know what \"massa de yakisoba\" is? UPDATE: Looks like the results are courtesy of Google Base... Copied! Back to Top",
