By: Kirsten Barkved June 20, 2019 The Ultimate Guide to Exploring Seattle This MozCon SEO Events | Moz News So, you’ve been debating for years about whether to attend MozCon and you’re finally ready to pull the trigger. Or, maybe you’re still not sure if MozCon is right for you and you’re wondering what the big deal is (a fair and reasonable thought). Whether you’re still on the fence or looking to get hyped, here’s the spiel for why you should attend this year's MozCon. And if, after seeing our awesome agenda, you're in need more than our stellar line-up and amazing donuts to convince you, then look no further than this post. We're less than four weeks away from MozCon, so we thought we'd dust off the old \"things to do while in Seattle\" list. So, if you’re attending or still doing research to see if the juice is worth the squeeze (how responsible of you!), here’s a sampling of the places you'll go whilst in Seattle for MozCon this July 15–17. Get your tickets before they're gone! We asked our Mozzers where to go Not only do our Mozzers have their fingers on the pulse of the city itself, but they’ve also got a few MozCons under their belt, so they know exactly what you need after a day's worth of information-absorbing and networking. The Underground Tour — “It’s strange and very Seattle specific.” — Rob Lisy Fremont Brewery — “Great beer and outdoor seating with a view of lake union and the city.” — Kelley Manuel Cinerama — “Movie theatre with the best chocolate popcorn in the world.” — Tyler Taggart Canon — “I have to advocate for Canon. Best chicharron I’ve ever had and incredible cocktails, obviously.” —Kavi Kardos Pacific Inn — “Best fish and chips.” —David Joslin Rachel’s Ginger Beer — “I like to get something from anywhere and then eat it here — hint: they will put booze in your ginger beer if you ask nicely. And pay more.” — David Pierce Michou — “A good choice for a quick grab-and-go sandwich.” — David PierceMuseum of Flight — “They have the Apollo 11 spacecraft on display. First time the National Air and Space Museum has shown it outside of DC!” — Chris Lowe Alki Beach — “Water taxi to West Seattle to walk along the beach and soak up some sun!” — Katarina Anderson Intrigued? We're just easing you in.Iconic stops We’d be remiss if we didn’t include a few “of course” stops in our post — there’s a reason these make it to every “30 things to do in Seattle” blog post. Cross a few of these iconic Seattle stops off your bucket list this July. The Space Needle Picturesque views of Puget Sound and a rotating glass floor make this spot a must for the ‘gram. Seattle Great Wheel Want to see Seattle from 157 ft above? Unless you’re afraid of heights, of course, you do! Tip: Stop by at sunset to see the sun dip behind the Olympic mountain range. Gas Works Park Beautiful, expansive views of downtown Seattle. Unwind after a day of being constantly “on” and enjoy the sun and the Pacific Northwest air. Insider Mozzer tip from David Pierce: “Get a sandwich from Paseo on Fremont and then go down the hill to eat it at Gasworks Park.” Fremont Troll For obvious reasons. Fun fact: The film crew behind the show, Once Upon a Time, filmed the Fremont Troll scenes right outside our Vancouver office. It was fun to watch them turn an underpass into the troll. But the magic quickly waned — ask our YVR Mozzers how much fun it was to not be able to park (or walk, or talk) outside the office during filming for a week or two. Weird stops Sometimes, you have to go off the beaten path to really get an idea of the soul of a city. And Seattle certainly has some soul. Here’s just a sprinkling of some of the weird things you can do in Seattle. Hat n’ Boots It’s exactly how it sounds. Originally a gas station, this 1954 must-see “soul of Georgetown” has been billed the largest hat and boots in North America, and we truly don't know how you could live with yourself if you make it to 80 and didn't see the largest hat and boots in North America. Official Bad Art Museum One man's trash is another man's treasure at the \"OBAMA.\" Enjoy a cup of coffee or a pint as you peruse the uniquely curated selection of bad art at Cafe Racer. Twin Peaks Cafe If you 1) have a car, or know someone who would carpool, and, 2) more importantly, are an uber fan of Twin Peaks, the greatest show to ever live, then it is definitely worth the 40 min drive up to Snoqualmie Falls to visit the actual town and cafe (Twede's Cafe) where the series was filmed in. Bring us back a piece of cherry pie, please. Go and see this house that looks like it’s from the movie Up Every few years, rumors swirl that the house that Edith Macefield refused to sell to developers is finally being sold. But while the outside may have changed, this little hold out home isn't going anywhere anytime soon and is symbolic to changing Seattle. You can find Edith's home here — it's hard to miss. Bonus points if you bring a balloon and know a dog named Doug. Meowtropolitan Cat Café Okay, this one isn’t really all that weird — it’s plain freakin' adorable! This cat café focuses on placing rescue cats and kitten into loving homes, but if you aren't able to house a kitty or two, that's perfectly fine! Cats need to be socialized and told they are very pretty and have nice whiskers. If you go, take a pic or it didn't happen. Just think of the conversation starters at our birds of a feather you’d have if you went. Tuesday or Thursdays are for Cat Yoga. Just saying. Outdoor stops We know that the reason people move to Seattle is because of all the tech jobs. But a close second? The great outdoors. Seattle has SO much to do in its own backyard — hikes, bike paths, beaches, lakes. And enjoying nature is always free. So stretch your legs and get out to any one of these stellar spots our locals haunt. Kerry Park If you’re a camera buff, this is a must-see, especially at sunset. You get a full view of the city, the water, the Space Needle, all with the glorious backdrop of Mount Rainier. Be prepared for a crowd, though — this spot gets pretty popular. Insider tip from Mozzer, Marcin Narozny: “Take postcard photos from Queen Anne.” Golden Gardens Park People don’t really equate sandy beaches to Seattle, but we have them in spades! Golden Gardens is a popular destination for strolls along the seawall. There’s also a designated dog park if you’re in the mood for dog spotting (which, like, is our favorite game). Waterfall Garden Park Want something a little more urban that doesn’t require a ton of travel? This hidden retreat is one of Seattle’s best-kept secrets in the heart of Pioneer Square. You can find it behind Occidental Square Park on 2nd Ave. Plus? It marks the birthplace of UPS! Myrtle Edwards Park Birkenstocks are optional. Dog pats are non-negotiable. Booze-y stops We're barely scratching the surface here with the best bars and pubs of Seattle, but for the sake of time, we had to keep it short and sweet. If there's something you didn't see on our list and feel strongly that it should have made it, don't be afraid to @ us in the comments. Rock Box For obvious reasons, this karaoke bar is top of the list for post-MozCon-feels — it's the perfect afterpart to let all that pent up conference energy out. Bring your best renditions of Total Eclipse of the Heart for some all night, much-needed crooning. Bathtub Gin Co. Don't go if you don't like gin. We can't be more transparent than that. Needle & Thread In the mood for something a little more low-key? Scope out this speakeasy, hidden above Tavern Law. There’s no official drink menu, but they take their cocktails seriously — just tell the barkeep your poison of choice and they’ll concoct something just for you. Shultzy’s We do love our beer in the Pacific Northwest, and this little German bar is home to some of Germany’s best brews. Plus: sausages. Unicorn & Narwhal Whimsical food and drink options galore, complete with an arcade, claw machine, and photo booth. Go on Sunday for their Mimosas Cabaret! Coffee stops The best coffee in Seattle isn’t in a Starbucks cup. It’s also not Seattle’s Best (is anyone shocked?). Because we take our coffee as seriously as we do our SEO, we updated this list and curated the top 5 best coffee places in Seattle. Bedlam For a taste of old Seattle, go to Bedlam. It has that pre-boom feel of old Belltown. Plus, real good espresso, comfy seating, toast and pie, and private meeting rooms to go and ponder over all the SEO magic you absorbed. Victrola Coffee There’s a reason locals haunt this cafe. Besides having one of the best pour-over cuppas in town, this cafe is also one of the quieter spaces, with ample seating and plenty of outdoor space should you want to bask in the sun. Bonus: There’s a roastery on site, so if it ain’t too busy, ask for a tour! Espresso Vivace If you’re looking for the best coffee in the city, look no further. Their scientific attention to detail and flavor is legendary, so much so that they'll even offer you advice on how best to actually drink your coffee in order to achieve the fullest experience. Sound & Fog We’re cheating a little with this one because it’s not just a cafe — it’s also a wine bar, offering beer on tap and rotating coffee roasters. Tougo Coffee Co. We can’t not have Tougo on the list. As one of Seattle’s oldest coffee shops, it also has some of the most down-to-earth, passionate baristas who are happy to answer all your brewing and roasting questions. Hanging out in Seattle longer than just for MozCon? If you're looking for more things to do and you're staying in our neck of the woods for longer than three days, we have tons more you can busy yourself with! Soccer fan? See the Sounders FC vs. Portland Timbers The Pacific Northwest's biggest rivalry is on Sunday, July 21st at 6:30 p.m. Make sure to join our MozCon Facebook Group and make plans to see the game with other MozCon attendees. More of a baseball fan? Stop by to catch a Mariner’s game. In town until the 21st? You better be now: July 21st is Bark at the Park. Tickets also include a postgame walk around the bases, so bring your goodest boy or girl. In the mood for a festival? The Capitol Hill Block Party is where it’s at. Local music, great food, art (both good and bad), people watching. Interested in exploring some of Seattle's neighborhoods and cultural celebrations? 45th Annual Ballard SeafoodFest, Friday and Saturday, July 12th and 13thWedgwood Art Festival, Saturday and Sunday, July 13th and 14thWest Seattle Summer Fest, Friday through Sunday, July 12-14thPolish Festival Seattle, Saturday, July 13thGeorgetown Garden Walk, Sunday, July 14thSeattle International Beerfest, Saturday, July 12-14Bremerton Summer BrewFest, July 19-20The Bite of Seattle, Friday through Sunday, July 19-21st.
