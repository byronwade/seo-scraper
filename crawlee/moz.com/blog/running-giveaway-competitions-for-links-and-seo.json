By: Rob Ousbey February 14, 2010 Running Giveaway Competitions for Links and SEO Link Building There are very few tactics which can guarantee success in linkbuilding. Executed correctly, giving something away is one that gets close to fulfilling that promise. This post covers competitions and giveaways; I'll share techniques and tactics you can use, and will include links to some interesting competitions seen online recently, and some that we've run for clients. Running giveaways online typically offers a few different opportunities; of most immediate use to SEOs is that competitions can attract links from authoritative sites and a variety of domains. They can also be great for data collection - it's fine to ask the entrants for their email address and whether they'd be happy for you to send them emails again in the future. Furthermore, there's a potential for increasing brand awareness amongst people who've not heard of you before. Running a Giveaway In the simplest competition users visit the website to fill out their details, possibly answer a simple question, and then a winner is picked out of the hat. Competition Prizes If you have high margin products, these can make attractive prizes without harming your bottom line too much (e.g.: giving away tickets for your theatre doesn't cost anything if the show isn't sold out.) You should also consider 'money can't buy' prizes: a trip to watch a rugby match is cool, but spending the day working for a national team and getting a signed jersey is priceless. Look out for partnerships: when Distilled recently ran a whisky giveaway (to create buzz around the brand prior to the launch of our US office) we were sent messages by Jura whisky and Master of Malt (neither of whom we knew beforehand) offering some quite exceptional additional prizes. There's potential to improve any competition by approaching suitable partners first, to offer some co-publicity and links. (I once emailed some contacts to ask for contributions to a competition, and ended up with £300 worth of books, £120 of CDs and DVDs, £50 of gift vouchers, two magazine subscriptions, a £120 digital camera, a wild animal adoption, a bottle of port and a towel that folded up into a beachbag.) Of course, the flip side of this is that you could simply look out for people in industries related to you that are running competitions, and offer an additional prize for their promotion, in return for links, etc. You can use Google to find such opportunities: search for terms like 'win' and 'competition' alongside phrases used in relevant niches (eg: 'win album' for music prizes) and then filter down to results from the last week / month. For example: this Google search. Get Listed The 'comping' community is a great place to seed your competitions to begin. Certainly in the UK, a listing on a few active sites will often send the first 2 - 5,000 entrants - and I'm sure it's not just us limeys that love a freebie. Search around for sites to submit your competition to, but regional sites you could consider include: Loquax.co.uk (UK) ThePrizeFinder.com (UK) Compaholics (UK) CompetitionWinner.com.au (AU) Each site may have specific restrictions, and can have a delay between a few days and few weeks before submissions are published, so submit your competition as early as possible. Seeding Send competition details directly to twitter users & bloggers who you either know well, or think would be interested in covering it. Remember that people can be less inclined to share a competition if it's good enough (to give themselves better chances of winning.) There are various creative solutions to this issue, but you can just keep it simple and appeal to the blogger's love of sharing cool stuff with their readers. Furthermore, look for opportunities to find partners who have email lists. Let's take two companies with email marketing lists: BigHotel (a large, fictional hotel chain) whoc is running a competition, and GreenTour (a successful, fictional eco-tourism site) which is launching a new feature. They have similar audiences, but there's no overlap between their products; BigHotel can mention the feature launch in their next newsletter and EcoTour can promote the competition to their subscribers. This just required finding a partner and making a gentleman's agreement; as Bonytoad is fond of saying: \"Win-Win, For Teh Win.\" Use Your Affiliates Make sure that your affiliates can add their tracking codes to the entry URL, and they'll help to spread awareness of the competition pretty quickly and to places you might not be able to reach to otherwise. Create a video primer The Irish rugby competition mentioned above was launched with a 60 second video promoting the prize. Videos are particularly shareable: embed codes can be copied from the Youtube page, and lots of social sites (including Tumblr, Facebook, Reddit) allow for easy importing of videos. Given that people might be watching the video anywhere, make sure to prominently display the URL for the entry page in the video, either on-screen or using video annotations. Get Press Lots of magazines and newspapers are happy to mention competitions and link to them from their websites. Find publications that target the geographic area or niche targetted by the competition. Pick up the phone and give them a call - ask to speak to someone who deals with promotions, or in the editorial department. A few minutes later you might have a decent link and some coverage that will be read by a very targeted group of people. Maintain Momentum When people have entered, it's a waste to just show them a 'thanks for entering' message. Use this opportunity to give a call to action - typically to share the competition with other people. Consider having a secondary prize that encourages people to share the competition. For example: Thanks! You've been entered to win a Cadillac Eldorado. Want to share this competition with your friends? Click here to send a tweet, or enter your friends' email addresses below to send them a message. Everyone who tweets / emails the competition will automatically be entered in a competition to win a set of steak knives. Upsell the Competition Have a successful competition, and want to take advantage of this get more entries? Take the email addresses of everyone who entered so far, and send them a message during the week before the competition finishes. Hi Rob, You recently entered our 'Win a Holiday for Two' competition through XYZ.com. The competition finishes in a week, and we'll be drawing the winner then. We've had quite a few entries, but only 10% actually got the answer correct. It's only one entry per person, but if you have any friends, partners or siblings who might want to win a trip to the otherside of the world, then do let them know that they have a week left to enter. (Don't forget to remind them who sent them the link if they do win.....) The entry page is still up at: www.xyz.com/win-a-holiday Best wishes, etcetera I've not done this, but I think it could work really well to add an extra 10% to your number of entries. To be honest, I'm considering not mentioning it here, and saving it for myself for a while, but I want to see what CTR & results anyone who tries it gets. Let me know if you have a chance. Other Competition Structures Outside of the basic 'name-out-of-a-hat' competitions, there's potential for all sorts of interesting competition structures. Competitions to Encourage Engagement Ooh.com run a competition with two $100 prizes each week. The winners are picked from the new 'OOHs' which have been uploaded, and encourages people to not only add their content, but to make sure it is as 'rich' as possible. Sites with user generated content (such as a forum, social networking or social media site) could use similar techniques to reward particular contributions. Twitter Competitions A competition where the only entry requirement is to tweet a message including a link to a site / account / hashtag has very low barriers to entry for Twitter users. Once up and running, such competitions excel at keeping momentum - the more people hear about the competition, the more people enter - and help to improve brand awareness for companies and products. The tactic's been used by a variety of organisations; the most famous execution was probably the competitions run by Moonfruit. This did well, but the concept already feels a little bit passé - plus you have to have an awesome product and spring for $10,000 of prizes to have the same impact that Moonfruit enjoyed. Consider modifying this viral 'self-fullfilling prophecy' competition for other formats or networks; Umbro had people upload photos on Facebook - the Facebook 'News Feed' then showed entrants' friends that they'd submitted an entry. If you're looking to find similar success for your sites, Google Buzz is still new & cool... I'm just saying... Procedural Points A couple of miscellaneous points about operating a competition: Conversion Rate Optimisation If you've attracted people to the competition entry page, you should hope to see a very good conversion rate to completed entries. Try using some CRO techniques on the entry page, to maximise the number of entries received and the amount of useful data collected. Avoid Cheats Log the IP address along with each entry - you can then investigate any IP addresses which submit a lot of entries to identify people who are trying to cheat the system. OK; I hope that this has been useful, or at least inspired you to go through the back of the cupboards, and see if you have anything interesting to give away. Using tactics like this can be an iterative process - it doesn't need to go exactly right first time, and people will never get bored if you run a few competitions to improve your process. Good luck!
