G By: GeoffreyF67 November 2, 2006 WordZe Discount for SEOmoz Readers Keyword Research The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I worked out a $20 discount with WordZe for SEOMoz readers. This is reduced from the normal price of $45. It only lasts two days, so take advantage of it quickly before the price goes up. Just to refresh your memory, if you're wondering what WordZe is, it's a new keyword research tool. The benefits of this tool over others is: It's less expensive. Patented WordRank Technology to let you know how many links you need for your site to rank. Dig down on keywords more deeply than any other tool out there. Daily, weekly, and monthly top keywords. Historical keyword counts. Now, the last time I posted about this I got a lot of flack about their data sources. Yes, I do happen to know what data sources WordZe has. However, it's competitive information and Levi has asked me not to disclose it. I have been actively using this system and in various forums I've been reading various reviews. So far everything has been positive, with people saying they are either making or saving money with this tool. Your mileage of course might vary, but I think it's worth your time to check it out. Incidentally, I did a Keyword Tool Roundup that you might find interesting. G-Man P.S. The link for wordze is just a discount code link. It's not an affiliate link, and other than being a user I have no benefit from providing the link :) Copied! Back to Top",
