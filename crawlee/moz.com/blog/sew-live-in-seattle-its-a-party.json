By: Rand Fishkin May 9, 2006 SEW Live in Seattle - It's a Party! SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Next Friday, in Seattle's Hotel Monaco, the SearchEngineWatch crew, including Danny Sullivan, Joseph Morin, Elisabeth Osmeloski (our esteemed organizer), Dana Melick, Heather Lloyd Martin, myself and several reps from each of the major search engines will be presenting to a small audience on SEO, SEM & website marketing. It's called SEW Live - the cost to register is only $100, so I urge everyone within driving distance to make the trek. Late on Friday night, there'll be an informal gathering at a nearby, yet-to-be-announced venue for cocktails and chit-chat. Even if you can't make it to the conference, be sure to join up with your fellow search industry players for a night of fun. I'll have details posted here once we've agreed on a location - we're initially thinking Fadó, which is just a few blocks south of the hotel. UPDATE: The after-hours party event will actually be held, not at Fadó, but at the Triple Door's Musicquarium (about three blocks from the W & Monaco). See this updated post on the subject. Copied!
