By: Erica McGillivray April 30, 2012 Gathering More Data: Time to Take and Share the 2012 Industry Survey Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Because we want to gather the best data from a wider sample set, we've extended the Industry Survey deadline until Friday, May 18th. Help your fellow online marketers and take the 2012 Industry Survey today. Our biannual survey covers everything from what you've been doing to what tools you've been using and how your team is structured to what you think the future of online marketing is. This year's survey takes approximately 20 minutes to finish. For those of you who haven't seen, check out the results of what we found in 2010. But as you know, our industry moves as quickly as fingers over a keyboard, and we hope that you're as excited as we see a broader view of what's happened since then. If you're still not quite aboard, Alan Bleiweiss from Search Marketing Wisdom says some great things about why it's important to better understand what we do. \"Even with the limitations such a platform has, this biennial crowd-sourced knowledge dump is by far, the single most valuable tool we in the industry have to help gauge the general state of where we as an industry are, and where opportunities might exist for efficiency and productivity, and insights and answers that we may have not given enough weight to on our own.\" Give yourself a 20 minute break and take the survey. At worst, you'll be sharing with your fellow marketers, and at best, you may win one of our fun prizes: One Grand Prize Winner will get a 16GB Wifi iPad 3. Three First Prize Winners will each get a $75 ThinkGeek gift certificate. Ten Second Prize Winners will each get a $25 gift certificate to the SEOmoz Zazzle Store. To see the full sweepstakes terms and rules, go to our sweepstakes rules page. The winners will be announced by June 4th. We'd also like to thank our partners who believe in the importance of this survey, including Outspoken Media, Search Engine Land, Distilled, Hubspot, Search Engine Journal, Techipedia, AimClear, Blueglass, Marketing Pilgrim and Search Engine Watch. All survey answers are anonymous, so your privacy will be protected. If you do enter the drawing, we will not share or abuse your email address. If you want to share out the survey via Twitter, Facebook, G+, etc., we'd be greatly appreciative. Thank you so much. You're awesome! Copied! Back to Top",
