Table of Contents Copied! By: Morgan Taylor Edited By: Emilie Martin June 11, 2024 How to Build a Strong Brand Moat With SEO Branding | Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The connection between building your brand and SEO is much stronger than many realize. We know that brand signals are important to Google, as suspected by many, and confirmed via the Google documentation leak in late May. At its core, increasing brand visibility can be seen as a fundamental aspect of SEO. By integrating brand-focused strategies into your SEO efforts, you're not just aiming for immediate traffic boosts but making your brand so distinct and well-regarded that it stands out from competitors. It’s like the groundwork for sustainable long-term growth – equivalent to a moat protecting your castle. This approach enhances conversion rates by making your brand more recognizable to potential customers and significantly improves the overall customer experience. Sounds like your desired goal? Keep reading to learn how building a moat with SEO can significantly drive business impact and lay a solid foundation for long-term brand recognition and visibility. The nexus of a brand moat and SEO: How does it tie back to business success? SEO isn't just about getting to the top of search engine results; it's about cementing your brand's presence in customers' minds. Establishing a 'brand moat' through SEO is essential for business defense and differentiation. When people search for anything related to what you offer and consistently find your brand among the top results, they start to see you as the go-to authority. This recognition is the foundation of your brand moat. It's what sets you apart from the competition. Hence, it’s important to have a well-executed SEO strategy that extends beyond visibility and translates into real business growth like: 1. Higher conversion rates: When people trust your brand, they're more likely to buy from you. SEO helps by ensuring your brand shows up where and when it matters, leading to more conversions. 2. Customer loyalty: A strong brand moat means customers keep coming back. SEO helps maintain this loyalty by keeping you visible and relevant. 3. Long-term growth: SEO isn’t a one-and-done deal. It requires constant updating and adjusting, but the payoff is sustainable and builds on itself over time. When you focus on SEO and building a strong brand, you're doing more than just trying to get clicks or make a quick sale. Brands like Hotjar have leveraged SEO to generate a 47% increase in traffic and a 20% increase in customers, proving how SEO can help drive business value. What are the key elements of a strong brand moat? Creating a strong brand moat for B2B brands requires more than publishing high-quality content. The real challenge lies in establishing the trust and visibility of your brand. To stand out in such a competitive environment, you need to take a strategic approach to content creation and SEO. This involves prioritizing strategies that not only build authority but also drive traffic and revenue. Competing with A-players is less daunting when you put focus on specific, relevant topics rather than casting a wide net with your content strategy. Let’s take a look at the key elements of a strong brand moat. 1. SERP dominance is vital to strong Brand Authority: Imagine you're in the superstore to buy a new electric toothbrush but unsure which model to choose. It's unlikely you'll be swayed solely by the manufacturer's claims. Instead, you're likely to seek opinions from trusted third-party publications and peers. This is where dominating Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) becomes crucial for your brand. That’s how achieving SERP dominance solidifies your Brand's AuthorityTM in the industry, making it a Moat that allows brands to maintain and sustain organic results. However, your wrong approach to SEO and brand building can dilute the brand's narrative and slow the building of authority. So, the key to accelerating growth and attracting quality search traffic lies in telling a cohesive, compelling story through your content — one chapter at a time and building a strong SERP presence. Take MasterClass, for example, a brand renowned for its heavy investment in advertising across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. In 2019 alone, Business Insider highlighted a staggering $6.5 million expenditure on ads, a figure that surged in the following months as demand for its offerings spiked. Despite its vast advertising budget, the primary traffic source to MasterClass's website and application is organic search. As you can see in the Google search results, Masterclass consistently secures the top spot for a broad spectrum of keywords, from highly specific terms to those with expansive monthly search volumes. This achievement underscores a pivotal strategy: satisfying search intent with the appropriate information that they are looking for. More than merely targeting keywords with significant search volume, MasterClass's success is attributed to crafting content that aligns with what users search for. By aligning content with user intent and ensuring consistency in quality across all touchpoints, brands can leverage SERP dominance to influence purchasing decisions and foster long-term customer loyalty. To dominate the SERP, establishing topical authority with high-value content is essential. 2. Build topical authority for accelerating organic growth: Topical authority is about building authority around a topic that aligns closely with your industry, product, and value proposition. You achieve this status by consistently providing valuable, expert content that addresses the needs and answers the questions of your audience. If your goal is to generate traffic and turn SEO into a revenue-generating channel, building topical authority in your space is the best way to go about it. Once you’ve built trust, momentum takes over, and people begin to pay attention to everything you publish. This narrow focus is far more effective than solely aiming for a high Domain Authority, especially for startups and businesses looking to make a tangible impact in competitive markets. Dominating the SERP with topical authority accelerates your organic growth and establishes a protective moat around your brand. Ultimately, your business can not only attract but also retain a loyal audience, turning SEO efforts into a revenue-generating channel. When brand excellence is combined with content excellence, the competitive advantage and moat created around your business can significantly deter competitors. 6 steps to build topical authority to strengthen brand signals You’ve learned about the essential elements of an SEO moat. Now for the meaty part: here are six practical tactics to build topical authority. 1. Cover the depth and breadth of a topic Topic clusters are the backbone of building topical authority. These are groups of semantically related articles that interlink, covering a core topic and its subtopics extensively. At the heart of a topic cluster is usually a pillar page, which serves as the hub from which cluster pages branch out. By thoroughly covering each sub-niche, your site gains more authority in the overall niche, which, in turn, fortifies your digital moat. However, this raises the question: How many pages on a specific topic does a website need to be considered an authority? The answer isn't straightforward and varies depending on the scope of the topic. For broad, highly competitive topics, achieving comprehensive coverage — and thereby, SERP dominance — might necessitate the creation of hundreds of pages. This is because the more content you have on a topic, the more likely search engines are to recognize your site as a leading source of information. Your first step to creating a topic cluster is to start with a pillar page and map out a broad spectrum of keywords within your niche. Start with broad, parent terms that encompass your category's umbrella topic. Let’s say a content cluster targeting the initial stages of the customer journey could focus on the concept of \"fundamentals of health insurance\" and encompass a range of related keywords such as: basics of insurance policiesterminology in health insuranceterms related to insurance policiesterminology for health coverageplans for health insurancebasics of health plans Also, doing a quick Google search reveals all the closely related topics your audience looks for: Select a topic that's expansive enough to inspire numerous articles yet focused enough to maintain cohesion and depth across your content series. To refine your approach and ensure it resonates with your audience's interests, conducting keyword research on your main topic and potential subtopics is a crucial step. This strategy not only sharpens your focus but also enhances the relevance and appeal of your content. 2. Create content to satisfy searchers’ intent Crafting exceptional SEO content begins with understanding the interests and needs of your target audience. If your organization utilizes user personas, these can serve as an excellent starting point. Your ICP data, which is developed through both qualitative and quantitative customer analysis, provides a detailed overview of your typical customer, including their goals and challenges, offering a foundation for content that resonates. However, it’s important to note that user interests are perpetually evolving. Staying ahead of these changes requires a proactive approach to content ideation. To give you an example, Hotjar has generated search-driven growth by creating content and practical guides that resonate and drive revenue. The result? Hotjar has seen 47% and 20% increase in search traffic and search-related sign-ups. A high CTR indicates that your content is not just reaching your audience but also engaging them effectively. This metric can guide you in refining your content to better align with what appeals to your readers.

A key highlight of this strategy is its templates, a treasure trove for those in the B2B sector, featuring a wide array of templates integral to their marketing approach. This specific page is a magnet for over 9,500 monthly visitors through organic search, ranking for more than 16,400 keywords, and holds an organic traffic value estimated at $42,400. The cornerstone of Airtable's success lies in its adept understanding and application of search intent, which fundamentally influences how people use search engines. Airtable's template page specifically caters to transactional search intent, attracting users poised to explore or utilize its templates. This approach leverages the vast array of over 41,000 keyword variations related to \"template,\" ensuring that Airtable remains a top choice for searchers. 3. Attract high-quality backlinks from reputed sites While the control over who links back to your content or mentions your brand remains limited, there are proactive measures you can take to attract quality backlinks. These backlinks not only enhance your site's authority but also drive meaningful traffic and improve search engine rankings. Strategic outreach: One of the most effective techniques for link building is outreach. And the success of outreach hinges on the unique value proposition of your content. This process involves using Connectively (formerly HARO), ProfNet, Featured, and Help A B2B Writer. When crafting your outreach pitch, it's crucial to articulate clearly why linking to your content benefits the recipient. Highlight how referencing your content could bolster the credibility of their own content, enriching trustworthiness and increasing organic traffic. Guest posting on reputed sites: Guest blogging stands out as an effective strategy for attracting backlinks, which is crucial for enhancing your site's SEO performance. One of the primary advantages is the opportunity to embed links back to your own website within the content. These backlinks are invaluable for SEO, as they signal to search engines that the guest blogger's site is a credible and authoritative source on the topic, potentially boosting its ranking in SERPs. It creates a win-win scenario where you gain visibility and backlinks while publishers enrich their content offerings and credibility. This method underscores the importance of strategic partnerships and quality content. Apart from building links, you also get: Networking opportunities: Engaging in guest blogging facilitates the development of professional relationships with editors and blog owners, paving the way for future collaborations and opportunities to contribute to industry conversations.Brand exposure: By showcasing their expertise on other platforms, guest bloggers can introduce their brand to a new audience, expanding their reach and visibility.Brand Authority: Consistently delivering insightful and valuable content across various platforms allows guest bloggers to build their reputation and establish themselves as thought leaders in their field.4. Make the most out of internal links While the SEO community often highlights the critical role of external links in ranking and visibility, the power of internal linking should not be underestimated. Internal links are entirely within your grasp to manage and optimize, presenting a unique opportunity to shape your site's authority and user experience. Internal linking is not just about connecting pages; it's about guiding both search engines and users through your website's hierarchy. Carefully planning your internal link structure, you can highlight the relationships between your content pieces, distinguishing pillar content from supporting cluster pages. For example, you have published a new review of hiking boots on your outdoor lifestyle blog. Integrating an internal link early in this content to your foundational pillar page about outdoor apparel and gear accomplishes two pivotal goals: When you link to the pillar page, you signal to search engines the priority and relevance of your pages. This strategic internal linking maps out a clear content hierarchy, enabling search engines to understand which pages serve as the core pillars of your site's content and how other pages relate to these key topics. Moreover, this approach to internal linking supports a more cohesive content strategy, where each piece of content not only stands on its own merit but also contributes to the overall narrative and authority of your site on its core topics. 5. Foster trust and credibility through reviews Online reviews play a pivotal role in shaping the reputation of brands and products, significantly influencing consumer behavior and business outcomes. A brand known for its high-quality offerings naturally elevates its standing among consumers. This direct link between positive reviews and brand perception underscores the importance of a strong online presence. A survey report by Moz reveals that “96% people read reviews and 86% of consumers find reviews a major decision-making factor. This confirms that online reviews play a crucial role in enhancing your brand's presence, engaging customers, and building their trust. They are essential to advocate for the quality of every product listed on your website. So, encouraging more high-quality reviews on your site is always beneficial. 6. Enhance user engagement to strengthen the brand signal Google values user engagement more than any other factor for ranking web pages in its search results. This emphasis on user engagement as a ranking signal indicates that Google rewards websites that satisfy and engage users, aligning closely with their search needs. Websites that excel in these areas receive higher rankings, making them more visible to future searchers. There are several ways to increase user engagement for SEO: Adding feedback widgets: Implementing feedback widgets on your website or conducting reader surveys can provide direct insights into your audience's preferences. This feedback is crucial for continually adapting and improving your content strategy to meet the needs and interests of your readers.Incorporating live support: Live support offering is a game-changer for providing immediate assistance to your customers. It stands out as the most efficient way to engage users, swiftly addressing their concerns.This immediacy not only reduces the volume of incoming support inquiries but also significantly enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty, which can lead to increased sales.Enhancing UX/UI: The key to a successful digital platform lies in its user experience (UX) and user interface (UI). Prioritizing a website design that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also easy to navigate ensures a seamless user experience.A well-organized site with straightforward navigation, coherent information architecture, and user-centric features is essential for keeping users engaged and satisfied.Website architecture and navigation:The structure of your website — how its pages are interconnected — plays a crucial role in both search engine optimization (SEO) and user experience (UX/UI).A well-thought-out site architecture allows for easy discovery and indexing by search engines like Google while also enabling users to find the information they need without hassle. Building a brand moat with SEO pays dividends in the long run The benefits of aligning SEO with brand development extend well beyond immediate gains in traffic or rankings. When you establish a distinct and powerful brand identity, your business can protect itself from the competition in much the same way a moat protects a castle. This protective barrier is not built overnight but is the result of consistent, quality engagement with your audience through optimized content that resonates and a user experience that delights the users. It contributes to a sustainable competitive advantage by fostering loyal customer bases, enhancing brand recognition, and ultimately supporting scalable, long-term growth. This is the kind of growth that is not easily eroded by changes in search engine algorithms or shifts in market trends. Copied! Back to Top",
