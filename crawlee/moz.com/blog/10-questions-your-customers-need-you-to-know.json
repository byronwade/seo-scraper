C By: Carlos del Rio August 2, 2007 10 Questions Your Customers Need You to Know Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Rand wrote an interesting post about 10 questions you should ask to determine your value as an SEO. It's a good read, especially the comments. It's no secret that I've been frequently disappointed by the level of knowledge of many SEO companies, even those who have a big presence in the industry. In fact, I believe that in the current search marketing environment, less than 30% of companies that spend money on organic search ranking services are getting a good deal. Rand focuses on technical understanding, mostly in Google. He implies that being able to answer the questions makes you a value add provider -- I disagree. There are plenty of people who can answer most, or all, of those question and still not provide value to a customer. Here is something a little more appropriate for a customer. Ask yourself the following questions: In how many languages can I code a site? Can I do link building? What types of servers can I implement a 301-redirect on? How many ways can I implement a site wide change? What types of analytics can I use? Can I generate valuable insight from analytics? What social media sites do I use? What blogs do you read? What site do i visit? Do I know someone who can do the things I can't? If you can't answer my 10 questions, it doesn't matter how many of Rand's questions you can answer. Bringing value to a client is not what you know right now (Rand's questions), but rather, what you can learn (my questions 7- 9), what you can do (1-6), and your dedication to completing the task.
