J By: Jeff Pollard November 29, 2007 The Launch of Private Messaging on SEOmoz Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Today I'm pleased to announce the release of Private Messaging here at SEOmoz. Starting now, you'll be able to private message other users using the sexy \"Private Message This User\" button (pictured on the right) on their profile page. You're also able to compose a message without clicking the button at the Write a Message page. Just start typing in the username of the person you're trying to message and the right person should come up automagically. NOTE: If you're unable to see the private message button on a users profile page, most likely you have cached our stylesheet. To fix this, hold down the \"Shift\" key and click the refresh button. That should cause you to reload the stylesheet and show the image. Once you receive a new private message, you'll get an email notifying you of the message and offering a direct link to go view the message. Controls over email notification, along with controls to either accept/deny all private messages entirely, are both available on your Edit Account page in your profile. Currently everyone is set up to receive private messages and receive email notification. As with all new features that we launch here at SEOmoz, your feedback is welcome. Please let me know about any bugs or problems you encounter while using private messaging. Also, we already have some feature additions on our to do list for the PM system, but feel free to suggest others you think would be helpful. Also, I wanted to give you a sneak peek at the next SEOmoz product that we have coming down the pipeline. Expect a release in the upcoming few days. It's gonna be rad. :) Copied! Back to Top",
