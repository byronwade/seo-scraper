By: Noam Chitayat May 27, 2015 Moz Local Dashboard Updates Moz Tools | Moz News Today, we're excited to announce some new features and changes to the Moz Local dashboard. We've updated your dashboard to make it easier to manage and gauge the performance of your local search listings. New and improved dashboard We spent a lot of time listening to customer feedback and finding areas where we weren't being as clear as we ought to. We've made great strides in improving Moz Local's dashboard (details below) to give you a lot more information at a glance. Geo Reporting Our newest reporting view, geo reporting, shows you the relative strength of locations based on geography. The deeper the blue, the stronger the listings in that region. You can look at your scores broken down by state, or zoom in to see the score breakdown by county. Move your mouse over a region to see your average score there. Scores on the dashboard We're more clearly surfacing the scores for each of your locations right in our dashboard. Now you can see each location's individual score immediately. Exporting reports Use the new drop-down at the upper-right corner to download Moz Local reports in CSV format, so that you can access your historical listing data offline and use it to generate your own reports and visualizations. Search cheat sheet If you want to take your search game to the next level, why not start with your Moz Local dashboard? A handy link next to the search bar shows you all the ways you can find what you're looking for. We're still actively addressing feedback and making improvements to Moz Local over time, and you can let us know what we're missing in the comments below. We hope that our latest updates will make your Moz Local experience better. But you don't have to take my word for it; head on over to Moz Local to see our new and improved dashboard and reporting experience today! Copied! Back to Top",
