By: Jane Copland January 9, 2007 Web 2.0 Awards, Version 2.0 Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I would start this post with the customary \"I'm sorry for using the phrase Web 2.0\" apology, but everyone who's ever used the term has already groveled to the 2.0 haters. It's that time of year again, folks. I have been charged with organizing the second annual Web 2.0 Awards.Last year, the Awards began as little more than a pet project. Undoubtedly one of Rand's 2 a.m. brainwaves, the results of the awards received an enormous amount of attention. Matt had a fun time on the day of the launch, dealing with a seriously traumatized server that was buckling under a huge traffic load. And now, we're going to do it all again.If you haven't done so already, make sure to nominate worthy sites via our nomination form. Although we have all the big-guys covered (no need to tell us how cool Digg and Flickr are, thanks), 2006's awards contained quite a few categories in which there were not enough entries to identify a clear winner. We're also inventing some new awards, such as Rookie of the Year and Most Improved. If you wish to nominate a site and can't find a category that fits, suggest a new one. Even our nomination procedure is interactive!There is one major change we're making to this year's awards, however. Last year, the results were generated entirely inside the SEOmoz office, whereas this year, we will invite thirty or forty people to make up a voting panel. So it'll be just like the Oscars, only nerdier.The deadline for submitting nominations is February 1, and then we'll begin the voting and sorting process. I'm not entirely sure what I've gotten myself into with this one, but seeing as Rand looked at my \"to-do\" list this afternoon and said, \"Oh, Jane has the Web 2.0 Awards. I'll assign this keyword research to Scott instead...\" I'm expecting a big task.So, bring it on, SEOmoz readers! Tell us what your favorite Web-Two-ey sites are, and help us make 2007's awards the sophomore success story of the year. Copied! Back to Top",
