By: Rand Fishkin September 1, 2007 Labor Day Fun - Vote on Facial Hair for Rand Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. It's Labor Day in the US, and technically, that means we should be celebrating the history of the labor movement and the advancements that lead to greater leisure time. This weekend, Mystery Guest and I are joining my grandparents to hike some canyons in the SouthWest - Zion, Antelope and hopefully, Bryce, too. Since the weather is hovering around 108 degrees fahrenheit, 42 centigrade, I decided to change up my facial hair for the trip. And now, you get to vote on what you like best :) Above, you can see me with my full beard in San Jose (with Mike Grehan) and in various states of removing said beard. So... which is your favorite? Survey - Take Our Poll On Tuesday (maybe Wednesday) we'll get back to the business of search, but for the rest of the long weekend, expect me to be very scarce :) Have a great Labor Day! Copied!
