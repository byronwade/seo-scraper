M By: mozUser1469147917838 April 27, 2006 It Makes Me Angry When Bad SEOs Try Form Injection / Spam Blogging The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Ok. Here comes a rant. I HATE WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO USE FORM INJECTION / SPAM!!!Feels a lot better... What kicked me ranting was that I'm sick and tired of seeing an ever growing flow \"Feedback Spam\" on my websites. I know, there are several scripts for ASP/.NET/PHP/JSP/Perl to tackle this issue, and yes I use them very effectively to flag spammy messages before their arrival to my desktop. Let's take an example from a spam message (this arrived about 15 minutes ago and ended directly to trash as Spam): Sender: dehumidifierContact detail: kawaicom@hotmail.comMessage: Dehumidifier supplier directory - Dehumidifier suppliers from China and around the world, Dehumidifier, Dehumidifier Manufacturers, Dehumidifier Factories,<a href=http://www.kawai.com.cn/eng-home.htm>Dehumidifier</a> Manufacturing, Dehumidifier Manufacturer, Factory, Company, Dehumidifier Exporters, Companies, Dehumidifiers Producers, Wholesalers, Distributors, Dehumidifiers, China Dehumidifiers. CHUANJING Electric Co. Ltd, the largest source of products made in China and Chinese OEM manufacturers. contact: kawaicom@hotmail.comIf Hangzhou Kawai Company is reputable, I hope they give their SEO / webmaster / marketing people some boot. I don't know what these people seriously expect to gain with these (very likely bot sent ) messages, but I think it's time to give them some bad publicity. Just added... Well, if Google is to believe, the same text is on 112 pages. To Mr. Cutts: how about a little penalty like removing from G index ? And not to put it all on Google's shoulders, Yahoo has a whooping 240 references and MSN 1015 references. And to proof that this kind of form/comment /guestbook spamming doesn't work, the site is nowhere in top100 for dehumidifier. All it does is irritate people who otherwise very well could be potential customers / partners. Copied! Back to Top",
