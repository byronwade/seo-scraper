G By: GeoffreyF67 February 13, 2007 Catastrophic Insurance Moz News This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Although the exact name escapes me at the moment for some reason (blame it on the chemo - yeah right!), if you're working for yourself or even if you're not there's something that you absolutely, without a doubt should think about. What am I talking about? Catastrophic insurance. It's the type of inurance that will protect you from calamaties when you lose your job because of some unforeseen illness. And with the occurrence of cancers on the rise (or at the very least stable - it just depends on what source you listen to), trust me - you do NOT want to be stuck holding the bill if this happens to you. Case in point... A couple of years ago I was employed by a company who shall remain nameless. Fortunately for me (I say I'm blessed - you might just call me lucky), this was only the second salary job that I had accepted in nearly 20 years. Along with this particular IT job came a very nice insurance plan and insurance in case you were no longer able to work. Unbeknownst to me, the month that I was considering full time employment there was a baseball sized tumor in my chest (Hodgkin's disease). Just as I accepted employment with them, my insurance kicked in and I was officially diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. Fast forward a year and I was fired for not being able to be at the office (even tho I could technically work the doctors would not let me be around people). Rather than fight it and deal with the pain and suffering of a lawsuit that could drag out for years I let it go. But I was very glad I had that insurance! The medical bills to date for my treatment have reached over $750,000 and we're not done yet! That's a very significant sum of money. And I also get money for being officially unemployable because I can't be around other people due to my immune system. So, to make a long story just a tad longer - if you haven't considered insurance because it's too expensive, timing isn't right, whatever - I highly recommend you rethink that opinion.
