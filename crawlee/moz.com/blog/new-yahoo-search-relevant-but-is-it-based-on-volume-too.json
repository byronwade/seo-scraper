L By: lauramaccallow@yahoo.co.uk October 5, 2007 New Yahoo! Search - Relevant, But is it Based on Volume As Well? Search Engines This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. This is interesting. Go to www.yahoo.com and type in Barry Bonds (e.g.) See the drop down list? Nice... but apart from assumed relevancy application to these suggestions, are they also based on actual search volume and listed in order based on volume? I would assume so. This appears to be Yahoo!'s answer to Google Suggest Search, but it doesn't appear to be in Beta, nor does it appear to be an add-on--it's just there. Will it last? Was it in beta? If it was, my apologies, I never saw it. A friend of a buddy brought this to my attention today. Can someone enlighten me on this new search tool/service from Yahoo!? And thoughts on its life span? I like it. I don't usually like the search engines thinking for me, but this offers the option to turn it on or off, and doesn't actually interrupt my actual search query. Copied! Back to Top",
