By: Rand Fishkin December 1, 2005 Nick's 80/20 Rule & Your Thoughts on SEOmoz Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I've been trying to find something \"relevant\" to point to a Performancing, Nick Wilson & Patrick Gavin's new foray into the blog publishing sphere and ran into this - The 80/20 Rule of Focus. From Nick: The problem in brief is that some, and by my reckoning, many, bloggers start off very focused on their core topic. But as they run dry of things to say, usually at around the same time that their subscriber base starts to really get into interesting figures, they start to wander wildly off-topic. It's particularly common among those that blog on tech, media and marketing issues but most likely applies to all of us. He goes on to note the inevitable shift: It seems once you start down this slippery slope, it really does begin to build momentum. Right to the point where you become YATB™ (Yet Another Tech Blog). Everyone and his dog is out there reporting that Google did this, RSS will do that, some A-lister said (insert something stupid here) -- but yet despite the commoditization of tech news, specialist, knowledgeable bloggers seem destined to taste the forbidden fruit, and turn a good blog into YATB. It's distressing. OK. So you've struck the fear into me, Nick. Now I need to know, honestly, from the readers... Is SEOmoz getting too \"off-topic\"? Do we cover the same stuff you read about from Barry, Danny, Todd, TW, etc.? If so, what would you like to see more and less of? Copied! Back to Top",
