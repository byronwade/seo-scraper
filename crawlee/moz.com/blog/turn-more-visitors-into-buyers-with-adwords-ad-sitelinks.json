By: EleniBuras July 29, 2010 Turn More Visitors into Buyers with Adwords Ad Sitelinks Paid Search Marketing (PPC) This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Ad Sitelinks is a new Adwords targeting feature for sponsored search ads that allows you to extend the value of your existing AdWords ads by providing targeted and specific links for searchers whose keyword triggered your ad. You will find the option to set up Ad Sitelinks in your Campaign Settings tab. It will appear as \"Show additional links to my site\" under the \"Ad extensions\" section. You should remember that Ad Sitelinks is a campaign-level extension, so the links you create should be relevant to any ad within that campaign. Adwords Ad Sitelinks let you display up to 4 extra destination URLs for users to choose from. This means that you can now provide more relevant options for highlighting certain products or services and create richer, more targeted ads that could improve the value of your brand terms and other targeted search queries. With Ad Sitelinks you can point users to specific information on your website such as store locators or special offers. Ad Sitelinks is great for seasonal businesses – this feature makes it easy to update and inform visitors about seasonal and limited online promotions. It also means your ad will have greater visibility and provide current and targeted information. Ad Sitelinks can also improve keyword conversion rates - especially on broad matched terms. We all know how hard it is to predict what customers are searching for when they use generic keywords without wasting money. Using Ad Sitelinks, you can test different ads linked to multiple destination pages. Visitors like to have the choice and variety when searching, so conversion rates will be higher if they can access their desired portion of your website quickly and easily. Another benefit of Ad Sitelinks is the ability to address multiple goals in one ad text (this is useful for company brand terms). For example if you want your visitors to complete a particular action after they have arrived to your site, then use Ad Sitelinks to start guiding them to the right page before they have even landed on your homepage. You can link users to separate goal actions like ‘Sign up for Newsletter’, ‘Find Nearest Stockists’ or ‘Request a Call Back’, and test for the best results on your ads. Google has already released figures that confirm that Ad Sitelinks can improve your CTRs by more than 30% and significantly boost your Adwords conversion rates. We have already started testing it at Blueclaw and if you have too, let us know your thoughts on this new feature! Copied! Back to Top",
