By: Sam Niccolls August 26, 2009 This Week in Search for 8/26/09 SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Before delving into industry news from the last two weeks, inspired by a pickup line used last night at the SEOmoz Training Seminar after party, I felt compelled to kick things off with a list of the five worst SEO pickup lines that no attendee of the SEOmoz Training Seminar in London should use this October. 5. Did it hurt? Did what hurt? ...when you stopped ranking for 'heaven.' 4. You know you can't spell duplicate content without u and i, right? 3. I'm not sure if you pay $79 a month, but you're a PRO member in my book. 2. Nice shoes... wanna rank? 1. My name is Danny, what do you say we 301 back to my place? Jobs that Leave you Friendless: You saw the bozos (er-um journalists) at Fox News published a list of 'Top Online Marketing Jobs to Leave You Friendless.' And yes, amidst telemarketers and spammers, SEOs were atop the list. But if you didn't catch Danny Sullivan's response, it's worth a read, too. Click, Drag, & Share on Social Media: Meebo's slick tool makes it that much easier to share. Whether or not this functionality is right for your site, it is worth taking a look at how this works by mousing over an image on MobileCrunch or reading more about the technology. Why Google is the New Microsoft: In a thought provoking article, Estately CEO Galen Ward, delves into the similarities between where Microsoft was in the 90s and where Google is today. The Demographics Driving Twitter's Popularity: The New York Times article describes how an older demographic is the primary force behind Twitter adoption, but eMarketer also came out with two Twitter studies showing how marketers use Twitter over Facebook and how most people tweet about useless babble. Oprah's Affiliate Smackdown: Last week was not a good time to be among the acai berry affiliates using images of Oprah or Dr. Oz without their endorsement. Both Oprah and Dr. Oz filed lawsuits against 50 online marketers who were using articles, video, images, and other such content to increase click through rates and sales. Why Craigslist is a Mess: Craig Newmark may be content with a small home and a bird feeder, but it's hard to look at Craigslist's \"ambiance of neglect\" and not wonder why the classified giant hasn't done more to improve over the years. In his recent article Wired's Gary Wolf takes a behind the curtain at Founder Craig Newmark, CEO Jim Buckmaster, and the inner workings of the company. Rock Out with your Stock Out: In addition to the digital distribution deal struck between INgrooves and Universal, social music service iLIke, perhaps best known for their successful Facebook app, was also bought by MySpace for $20 million. Continued Focus on Local Search: David Mihm and others received a myriad of questions at the SEOmoz Training Seminar this week, but mozzers are not alone with their interest in local search. MSNBC will soon weave more local search results into their site through the acquisition of EveryBlock, a site founded by ChicagoCrime.org founder Adrian Holovaty. DaaS Companies are Emerging: Wall Street Journal's article goes into the successes of companies such as Open Table and talks about how data mining can be incredibly lucrative for data as a service (DaaS) companies who do it right. Meet Sheryl Sandberg: She narrowly missed Forbes' list of 100 most powerful women, but Harvard graduate, ex-Googler and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is playing an instrumental role in balancing data protection with advertising revenue. And with Facebook lagging MySpace to the tune of hundreds of millions in annual revenue, it's an area where the social network has room for improvement. 14 Reasons Enterprise 2.0 Projects Fail: We might learn more from our failures than from our successes, but with any luck this list of why enterprise 2.0 projects fail can prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from falling into common pitfalls. PR Firm Reverb Communications Creates False Reviews: Any PR is good PR, right? What about bad PR for a PR firm? Well, after being exposed for hiring dozens of interns to write fake reviews at the Apple App Strore, Reverb Communications now knows a thing or two about the absolute value of PR.
