By: Paul Lalley November 10, 2010 Time-Sensitive Keywords: Mobi, Jargon and Buzzwords Keyword Research This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Language has always evolved, so sayth etymologists, aka word nerds. But in the past, it evolved slowly as cultures integrated and media was limited to the newspaper and Life magazine, a household staple in the ‘50s and yes, I used to read it every week.Digital interconnectivity has sped up the evolution of language like a meth-crazed lexicographer. (There could be one. Somewhere?) The web creates a hotbed for the creation and dissemination of new words, words with new meanings and total paradigm shifts in the dry cleaning industry.Too academic? Well, this speed-of-digital evolution of language, and the hyper expansion of the word base offers a variety of SEO opportunities in the keyword selection sphere (KSS) based on muti-variant testing during the soft launch.TextingWeb access has been the exclusive domain of PCs (okay, and Macs, too). You wanted to access Amazon to buy a latest bestseller, you did it when you got home. Today, 17% of web access is through smart phones – iPhones, Androids and, bringing up the rear, Blackberry PDAs.Ths incrs n wb aces cre8s nw lngage at hper spd, cre8ting nu opps 4 SEO. The use of web access by phone, TV, PDAs and other technology has created new jargon (I need more bandwidth. Is this a hotspot?), and new technology-driven portals to the W3. Staying on top of this ever-changing mobi-speak enables you to target the mobi-market n wrds usd 2 serch.Know your apps. Stop by appworld.com to stay current on this expanding-paradigm-shifting-teachable-moment-target-demo-techo-savvy market segment and know your app utilities, functionality and, of course, user-friendly interface.JargonWe love it. We use it. We make up stuff. That’s so cool.Non-reciprocal inbound link, site audit, doorway page, CSS, API, php, OSS – we’ve made it impossible for “outsiders” to understand a single thing we say or do, which makes SEOs boring party guests. Friends just don’t want to hear about the utility of cascading style sheets.Jargon, from any industry, is used to separate insiders from outsiders. Writing for a service provider, my synapses sent me “predictive failure analysis” as a new service offering and perhaps, a new piece of industry jargon within a to-be-defined time frame. I’m not saying I created it. I prolly stole it from something I read eight weeks ago. Copy writers collect jargon words like baseball cards. Some even write down the really cool ones and try to work them in while remaining document compliant.B2B sites should use industry jargon as keywords. These are the keywords industry insiders enter into search boxes. B2C not so much. If you’re selling SIPs (structured insulated panels, also referred in construction jargonese as skins) directly to homeowners, SIPs mean bubkus. They never heard of it.Medical services providers are the worst. A service provider’s site (don’t ask) provides tinnitus therapy, so tinnitus is the hearing pro’s strongest keyword. Jeeze, how many prospects are going to use tinnitus as their search term? As a result, this site barely has a pulse.So, to maintain the reader’s cognitive absorption rate: use jargon in your keyword selection for business-2-business sites. If the site targets consumers, try “ringing in the ears” rather than tinnitus and your client will see better results and send you a card over the holidays.Buzz WordsThe W3 is a hotbed for the creation and dissemination of buzz words. These effective keywords have a short freshness date and so a shorter shelf life.Consider Y2K. Back in the day (that would be 1999), Y2K was hyper-viral. Today, even mentioning Y2K dates you so it just doesn’t show up except in academic treatises as a footnote. You won’t find Y2Z in sales copy with sizzle, that’s for sure.Buzz words do make good keywords, at least for a while, but like anything, buzz words have a popularity arc until they become obsolete and even SEO-neutral. Groovy.There are lots of good sources for buzz words. The talking heads news shows are veritable buzz word creation centers. Last year most of us had never heard the term “top kill” until BP underwent an unplanned release of below-surface assets causing some disruption within the Gulf Coast region, as we speak.“Top kill” moved from insider industry jargon to buzz word du jour. (Around the water cooler) “So you think the top kill will work? (What do I look like? An oil rigger?)When buzz words are in the early stages of their digital life cycle, they make excellent keywords, assuming the relevance factor is in place at the time of the site’s hard launch.Language evolves. Words and phrases come and go. What was hot last year is DOA today. And keywords come and go even faster. So consider the life span of keywords and choose words with staying power and a long “shelf life.”Once keywords have lost freshness, well, let’s just say they jumped the shark. Copied! Back to Top",
