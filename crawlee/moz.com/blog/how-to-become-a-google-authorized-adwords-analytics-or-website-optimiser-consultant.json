T By: Tom Critchlow June 15, 2009 How to Become a Google Authorized Adwords, Analytics or Website Optimiser Consultant Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Google Authorization is a topic which crops up a fair amount in our day-to-day search wanderings. Not really because clients are asking if we're authorized but more because they always claim that previous SEO companies they received pitches from claimed to be Google Authorized SEO consultants. Unfortunately (fortunately?!) no such certification exists so we have to set them straight. In addition to that, there seems to be some confusion around what the different levels of certification are with some people in the SEO community so I thought it would be a good idea to write a post explaining the different kinds of certification and how you go about getting them. In order from easiest to hardest: Google Adwords Certified Individual This is the most common form of Google certification and is the easiest to get. According to the Google advice the following is all you need to do in order to become a Google Adwords Certified Individual: Accept the rules of use. These basically say things like \"don't be evil\" but in a few more words. Manage at least one Adwords account in an MCC (my client center) for 90 days. Have a total spend of at least $1000 (or equivalent local currency) in your MCC during the 90 day period. Pass the exam. For most people, the exam is the main focus of the certification. It costs $50 each time you take the exam and I think you can take it as much as you like. Everyone at Distilled who's taken the exam has passed first time and this shouldn't pose much of a problem so long as you're familiar with Adwords and have studied the lessons. It's worth noting that you should take a look at the lessons even if you're familiar with Adwords since they can cover things such as invoicing as well as questions about the whole spectrum of ads - from search ads to content network and banner ads. Make sure you're familiar with the whole system, not just the stuff you use every day. The format for the exam is 100 questions in 90 mins and you need at least 75% to pass. The benefits of being an adwords certified individual is that you get a funky badge like this: And you also get a professional status page hosted on Google which verifies your status which you can link to (can anyone say badge-bait?!) Google Adwords Certified Company A Google Adwords Certified Company is basically a company which contains a few certified individuals and has a much higher total spend in the MCC, here's the requirements from Google: Have a billing and mailing address in one of these countries Employ at least two individuals who are qualified individuals (see above) - note that they need to be qualified with the same MCC. Have a minimum spend defined by the country you're in (see here for a list) - in the US and the UK the required spend over a 90 period for the MCC is $100,000. The major hurdle to becoming a qualified company is the spend in the MCC which is a lot bigger than for qualified individuals. Not only must you have this spend but you need to keep that level of spend over any 90-day period which can be tricky as clients come and go, especially if you're running seasonal campaigns. The benefits are very similar to above, you get an updated badge like this: And a similar professional status page on Google as before. Google Analytics Authorized Consultant (GAAC) Unlike the Google Adwords authorized individuals and companies, Google Analytics authorized consultants are much rarer. You'll see why in a second when I detail all the hoops you need to jump through in order to become qualified! Here's the Google page detailing the requirements, I've done my best to summarise below. The biggest change however to the above qualification is that it's not based on an exam or a form you fill out but it's much more like an interview. You need to submit a document detailing all the reasons why you should be an authorized consultant via email to THE GOOGLE. Your email should provide evidence of the following: You offer a range of stand-alone Analytics services including implementation, configuration, training and consulting. 3 verifiable, paid, expertly deployed Google Analytics projects with at least 3 different clients who Google will contact for references. These case studies should show all kinds of things including, interestingly enough, examples where you have customised the GA code for your clients. A proven expertise in web analytics including blogging, speaking or white papers. At least 2 employees who have taken and passed the GAIQ test. As well as these initial criteria there are also ongoing criteria which you must meet which are: Sending at least one employee to the Google Analytics Authorized Consultant summit (held once a year in Mountain View, CA) at your own expense. Providing a report at the end of each calendar quarter detailing all GA projects you have worked on during that quarter including client names and results achieved. Depending where in the world you are, sending an employee to California could be quite pricey so it's quite a commitment. I wonder also how the second requirement influences the companies ability to sign NDAs. Anyone who works with a Google Authorized Analyitics Consultant should be aware that they may well have their details shared with Google. That all said, the benefits are much more tangible for being authorized. There are less than 100 authorised companies world wide! In addition to being a member of this exclusive club you get the following benefits: Possible client referrals from Google sales teams Elevated technical support for Google Analytics Listing on the Google Analytics Partner page Invitation to attend annual GAAC summit at Google offices Access to an exclusive GAAC web forum to share ideas and technical tips with Google and other GAACs A fancy badge like this to display on your site: Google Website Optimizer Authorized Consultant (WOAC) And last on the list is the Google Website Optimizer Authorized Consultant badge. I think this might actually be slightly easier than the GAAC certification but since the list of authorized companies is smaller I've put this one last on the list. To get authorized you need to follow a similar process to the GAAC - you need to email Google with a document detailing how you meet a load of criteria defined by Google. I've summarised here, your email should display evidence of: Having designed and implemented at least 3 verifiable and successful Website Optimizer experiments with 3 different referenceable clients.Google specifically requests that you provide screenshots of the tests you're running so they're looking for quite in-depth references here. Proven expertise including blogging/speaking/white papers etc Providing a range of services dedicated to Google Website Optimizer including setup, training, and consultation. Being willing to attend and pass Google Website Optimizer technical training sessions at a Google office. (Sessions usually last a few days and are held once per year in Mountain View, CA, USA). It's not explicitly stated but I presume this is out of your own pocket as with the GAAC. Being able to commit to launching a minimum of 3 Website Optimizer experiments per quarter. Like with the GAAC the benefits are worth having. The list of Authorized Website Optimizer Consultants is only 33 companies long! As well as being on that exclusive list you also get: Elevated technical support Co-marketing opportunities A listing on the Website Optimizer Partners page A fancy badge, as always: So now you know what it means to be \"Google Authorized\" - and you can safely debunk the myths of being \"SEO Google Approved\". Also - I'd love to hear from anyone who is an Analytics or Website Optimiser authorized consultant. Are there benefits that aren't listed on the site? Have you seen Google actually pass you any leads?! Copied! Back to Top",
