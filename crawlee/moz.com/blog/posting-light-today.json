By: Rand Fishkin June 29, 2005 Posting Light Today Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Due to my work schedule being overwhelmingly busy today, I won't be posting much. I feel bad about this, since my loyal readers - you - have been kind enough to drop by.

Barry & many others are talking about Yahoo!'s new personalized community search Google's announced an API for maps - that should be fun. There's a long, interesting discussion at TW over MSN vs. Google Xan Porter's got a good post on the subject of MSN's Neural Net SEW Forums has two good topics - one on the futility of document topic analysis and the other on the Black Hat v. White Hat debate. Copied! Back to Top",
