Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin December 5, 2006 More Hot Topics from Chicago SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. This event is fast and furious, so I've got to keep it in list format again: Apparently, I was wrong about Todd Malicoat - he has a crush on me (pictures to prove this later), not Lisa Barone. On the female side of the aisle, there is a girl that he's devoted to, but she's not at the conference, so we don't get to meet her :( In other news, I interviewed Vanessa Fox for WebProNews a few hours ago and actually had a terrific chat about Sitemaps - format, signals, what to use it for and what they really pay attention to in the meta data you can provide (the interview should be live next week). Prior to Vanessa's chat with me, I asked her to make an addition to the Google Webmaster Guidelines page, noting how important it can be to deliver either a 404 or a 200 for a robots.txt request. Apparently, Google might have big problems crawling sites that have server errors or timeouts when requesting the robots file. We visited the Art Institue of Chicago today and had a terrific time. I highly recommend going if you can make it to the city - their collection is fantastic (and yes, they have that Seurat work that's featured in Ferris Bueller's Day Off) Matt Cutts' Pubcon callout of a gentleman who ran a lot of \"spammy-looking\" sites is getting a good bit of press and discussion - should Google be punishing sites because they're owned by operators of other, unsavory properties? My post on TLA's transparency stirred up some anger with Patrick's crew - my apologies there. Luckily, I have no such beef with ReviewMe, which is an excellent service model in my opinion - more on that later. Loren Baker's got a fancy new design... ours is behind schedule, as always, but I promise it's good. Calcanis lost the respect of a lot of folks in the webmaster industry this morning; according to attendees, hypocrisy & bad-mouthing the folks who hired you for a keynote don't go together as well as Jason might have thought. Google threw a closed-door party tonight that upset more folks. Quite a few big Google partners and spenders (who griped about it on the expo hall floor) were not invited. Now it's MSN's turn to snub would-be party-goers at the next conference :) The high today in Chicago was 26... low around -10. It's chilly, to say the least. SEOmoz auctioned off a link last night at Alan Dick's Vintage Tub & Bath party. He'd prefer I use the anchor text - clawfoot tubs. Note to self - add sponsoring events and inviting bloggers to list of good link building tactics. Hatbait is hilarious - great photos and a great idea from Liana. For those Chicago SES attendees who are reading - anything I missed that needs to be discussed? Copied! Back to Top",
