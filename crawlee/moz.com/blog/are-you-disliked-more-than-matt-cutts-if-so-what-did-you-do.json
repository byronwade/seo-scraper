B By: Brent Payne December 12, 2007 Are You Disliked More than Matt Cutts? If So, What Did You Do? Moz News This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Poor Matt Cutts. The guy can't catch a break lately with his recent anti-paid links crusade, and now the subdomain vs. subdirectory debate going on. He's trying to make the world a better place to search and has managed to continue the fight despite the loss of his top web spam slayer six months or so ago. But, alas, all is not lost Mr. Cutts, for you are but only the 11th most disliked person here on SEOmoz. What is that? 11, you say?! Ah, yes, there are indeed a handful of people that have the honor of being disliked more than the guy we love to not love--Matt Cutts. Super-scientific chart of most \"disliked\" members on SEOmoz (click to enlarge) As this spreadsheet clearly shows, we at SEOmoz only dislike 7.77% of what you say. The rest of what you say we tend to like. So who are these ill-fated people that have it worse than even Matt Cutts? How did they manage to land themselves in such a tar pit? I mean, Matt Cutts, sure, we understand he's the Mucky Muck of Search Quality at Google and most of us SEO types are pretty opinionated about what Matt & Co. are doing. Well let's take a little looksie at the top three to find out what they did to land themselves on this most advantageous list of who's who in SEO... 1. Michael Martinez - Perhaps search engine optimizers aren't fans of Hobbits and Middle-Earth. Or maybe it is his 'soften' picture in his profile and his own site. But we all know it is neither of these, because his departing message from SEOmoz pointed to some type of rift occurring. I just can't find what it is. My curiosity is killing me now. Please someone comment on what happened. Perhaps we can pull Michael out of hiding even. ;-) 2. Solomon Rothman - Alright, so his profile is a bit spamtastic, but from what I can find, he never posted a YOUmoz article that bombed. He must have been really unpopular in the comments, but I can't find any of his recent comments having issues. Again, what happened with Solomon Rothman? What did he do that the SEOmoz community disliked so much to rank him worse than Matt Cutts? 3. Igor Berger - Once again, no YOUmoz posts to his discredit. But yet he has over 80 thumbs down. Sure, nowhere near Michael's nearly 300, but still a hefty number. He seems like a funny and likable guy from the comments I see him making over the past few weeks. What's wrong with Igor, everyone? Now to keep things in perspective...I am not far off the list. I'm currently the 29th most disliked participant on SEOmoz, and I've only been active for the past 45 days. So, I may soon join the ranks of those disliked more than Matt Cutts. This will be especially true if I can't find out which wrong turns these three managed to make. Note: The \"disliked\" list is meant to be a comical analysis. Only one factor played into determining this fun list: the total percent of thumbs down for a given profile on SEOmoz. This is not a true reflection of who is and who isn't liked or disliked. If you are one of these 11 people, take it in good spirits, as it was meant to be delivered. (CYA, hopefully covered.) Copied!
