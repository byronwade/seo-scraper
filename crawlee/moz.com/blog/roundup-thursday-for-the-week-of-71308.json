By: Rebecca Kelley July 17, 2008 Roundup Thursday for the Week of 7/13/08 SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Three star links: 10e20 brings us \"The Ultimate Guide to Decoding Digg Speak.\" It's both amusing and surprisingly thorough. Pretty handy if you're an SMM noob and need to know what \"those crazy kids\" are talking about. Now we know why your socks keep disappearing when you wash them...they make a good snake sweater! Here's an interesting article about how the \"Google generation\" thinks differently. Generation Google appears to prefer multi-tasking, networking, multiple media sources,and images and video over text, while \"digital immigrants\" prefer the opposite. Interesting stuff. Speaking of interesting, here are 10 things you might not know about your credit card.

Got any extra urine lying around your house, Howard Hughes-style? If so, send it on over to NASA! The McCain campaign is spidering Barack Obama's website in order to spot any word changes. Politicians are some pretty stubborn sons of bitches. I like how they're never allowed to change their opinion on any stance whatsoever. If that's the case, shouldn't McCain still be in favor of using muskets in battle? (Get it? The dude's old.) Yahoo! is using an automated algorithm to select stories for its front page, which has led to a 25-30% CTR increase. Speaking of Yahoo!, this article confirms that getting a story on Yahoo! Buzz is much more valuable than getting it on Digg or getting StumbleUpon traffic. Hat's off to The Economist for being a good sport about Stephen Dubner's \"pasty\"/\"pastry\" misunderstanding.

Marketing Experiments discusses ways to optimize your testimonials. Great tips--it's easy to think that you can just slap some testimonials onto a page and think that's that, and this post proves otherwise. The Google Cache posits an interesting hypothesis on what will bring about the end of paid links. I personally think this is a huge overkill--it's a dick move for a site to nofollow all of its outbound links.
