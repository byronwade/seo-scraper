  "content": "Ready for S'more? The MozCon 2022 Day Two Recap Moz News | SEO Events By: Cheryl Draper July 13, 2022 Table of Contents Copied! By: Cheryl Draper July 13, 2022 Ready for S'more? The MozCon 2022 Day Two Recap Moz News | SEO Events Day two of Camp MozCon was everything we expected it to be: more networking, more marshmallows, and more brilliant presentations from the top minds in the industry. Speakers covered the SEO gamut — from research and content creation, to e-commerce, and more! Not only were the presentations chock-full of insights, but the storytelling had us feeling as though we were all sitting around the campfire. Everyone was dialed in and ready to turn insights into actions. More Than Pageviews: Evaluating Content Success & Correcting Content Failure — Dana DiTomaso Dana started the day by making us think: what is the best way to measure content success? And she didn’t just mean which KPIs should we measure, but also how we are going to track those KPIs. The example she talked about was pageviews, which sounds easy enough. The issue though, is that every time a tab is refreshed (even by tag hoarders) a pageview is tracked. This can very easily skew your data. To collect accurate data, Dana’s team used Data Studio connected to GA4, which uses events collected through Google Tag Manager. She did this by collecting the publish date, creating a custom formula that collects the publish date, and dividing the pageviews by day. Now the client can truly see how pages are performing without skewed data. This wizardry was just the tip of the iceberg, though. Dana then went through how to measure whether people are reading your content, what percentage of people who actually see the CTA are clicking it, and more. As always, Dana closed by reminding us to focus on what is important and ignore what isn’t. Don’t introduce doubt if you don’t have to. woah - so smart... take the tab hoarders out of your data, cause they're driving down your conversion ratevia @danaditomaso #mozcon— Greg Gifford (@GregGifford) July 12, 2022 Trash In, Garbage Out: A Guide to Non-Catastrophic Keyword Research — Tom Capper Tom’s storytelling reminded us all too well of a situation we despise as SEO: clients focused on head terms. We’ve all had a client who just wants to rank for “flower delivery,” haven’t we? Our solution as SEOs is to create so-called exhaustive lists of metrics and keywords, but Tom argues this is just as useless. Instead, Tom suggests: Capture intent instead of keywordsIdentify true opportunities for click trafficAim for accuracy (pick good tools) Should you choose to skip these suggestions, it’s likely you’ll end up with overly-inflated and far-from-helpful data. Tom showed us an example of Google Ads data overestimating clicks by a factor of 18x, what happens when a keyword list reports volume data without organic CTR estimates, and that over 15% of searches every day are brand new. Good keyword research:1. Focus on quality not quantity2. Don't assume rough volume and rank gives clicks3. Don't take accuracy for granted4. Something about a garbage truck not being a garbage truck@thcapper #MozCon— James Wirth (@jameswirth) July 12, 2022 SEO in the Enterprise: Tips and Tricks for Growing Organic Traffic at Scale — Jackie Chu It’s always a treat to learn from Jackie, and this year is no different. She walked us through how she works with enterprise teams to grow organic traffic. Anyone who has had this goal knows one thing - it takes a lot of convincing. Luckily for us, Jackie shared her solution for gaining buy-in. First, she identifies the most impactful projects by asking these three questions: Does it impact crawling/indexing?Does it impact a lot of pages?Is it strategically relevant? After identifying potential projects, it’s time to prioritize them through forecasting and storytelling. Jackie shared her thoughts on three forecasting strategies: top-down, bottom-up, and competitive share forecasting, along with the pros and cons of each one, and how she uses the RICE framework to prioritize projects. To keep people in your corner after they’ve worked with you, be sure to thank them! Not just privately, but in front of their bosses and colleagues as well. Overthinking and over communicating your wins ensures that the cross-functional teams you work with understand the impact they’ve had through working with you. Rinse and repeat these 3 steps:1. Identify the best SEO opportunity2. Ruthlessly prioritize, forecast, and storytell to get buy-in3. Share your wins to continue getting support@jackiecchu #MozCon— Moz (@Moz) July 12, 2022 The Future of Local Landing Pages — Amanda Jordan This is Amanda’s very first MozCon and she spent it rocking the stage talking about local landing pages. Notice the added adjective “landing”? Amanda told us that she sees each local page as a landing page that should convince users to do business with her clients, kind of like a page built for PPC users. She believes that if a user gets to your local page, they are trying to complete a goal, and it’s up to us to provide the tools they need in order to do so. The top features included on top local landing pages include: Local reviewsUnique value propositionsCoupons or conversion opportunitiesAwards and recognition Aside from offering these tools, moving forward, local SEOs are going to need to pull data from their CRM to speak to the exact pain points of their customers, increase the use of local government statistics, and lean on user-generated content through surveys and polls. \"Users like getting to a page and feeling like they know something about the business AND that the business actually cares about them.\" @amandatjordan #MozCon— Melina Beeston (@mkbeesto) July 12, 2022 How Marketing Data Intelligence Skyrocketed Our B2B Conversions — Tina Fleming Tina took us down memory lane, and not necessarily in a good way. She reminded us of iOS 14 and the cookie-pocalypse, and how much that sent us spiraling. Tina used this example to assure us: it’s time for us to embrace being data-driven in order to create better user experiences (even when we feel like the data is impossible to collect). And the best way to ensure you have data you can use is to collect your own! The first place this can be done is by using your CRM, but where the CRM falls off (i.e. unknown users) a data acquisition platform can pick up. This data will then allow you to create personalized experiences for users. Tina even showed us the example of her company’s website, and how their homepage was optimized to speak directly to the user using the data they already had. Lastly, Tina told us to focus on collecting the data we can’t collect using public data. If people are willing to share that information, they are much more likely to be sales qualified. 3 tools to get started with this methodology:1.) CRM2.) Data activation platform3.) Personalization toolFind the tools that work best for you & w/each other. @TinaInTheSun #MozCon— Ruth Burr Reedy (@ruthburr) July 12, 2022 Achieve Accessibility Goals with Machine Learning — Miracle Inameti-Archibong Asking for help in any situation is hard, which often means the ask isn’t brought to those who can help. For that reason, we feel so grateful to have Miracle at MozCon to remind our industry of the importance of site accessibility. She reminded us that some of the tasks that we find to be “less important” for SEO are actually extremely important for site users. For instance, one-third of all images have questionable or repetitive alt text — despite the fact that we know how to monitor alt text, and how to change it for the better. To be sure you aren’t contributing to the problem, Miracle equipped us all with the pillars of an accessibility audit. Your website should be: PerceivableOperableUnderstandableRobust She also shared tools that help you with this audit, and demonstrated why using a screen reader yourself to assess your content is the best way to understand how your content will be consumed by a user who needs one. When your website isn’t accessible, you are preventing people with disabilities from becoming independent. Content organization matters. Alt text matters. Don’t skip these things because they seem like “lower priority” or “not important” #mozcon— Angie Carson (@Swinging4Mars) July 12, 2022 How True Leaders Transform a Marketing Department into a Dream Team — Paxton Gray You’re a badass marketer, which means you have likely — will likely — be asked to lead a team of marketers. Here’s the thing, though: our job changes every day, and there are very few resources to become educated on that job. Due to this lack of education, once you become a part of the marketing leadership team, the fear of failure can become real. To overcome that fear, focus on clear, attainable goals. This may require you to dig a bit deeper than you’re used to and ask more questions, but it will help you to not just find more happiness in your role, but to help your clients more as well. Once you have a clear focus to work toward, it’s time to close the feedback loop. Identify everyone involved with your campaigns and ensure they have access to all of the data. Doing so allows your team to work together more cohesively. Lastly, remove the barriers to beneficial risk-taking by openly sharing the burden of campaign outcomes. Let your team know you are there with them, and you’re not going to let them fall. People on a team function as vectors. As leaders, our job is to get those vectors aligned and pointing the same way. @PaxtonMGray #MozCon— Ruth Burr Reedy (@ruthburr) July 12, 2022 Myths, Misconceptions, & Mistakes (Lessons Learned from a Decade in Digital PR) — Hannah Smith Hannah used this talk to review some of the things she has said over the years. The first thing: “you don’t need luck, you just need to work really hard.” Which sounded nice, but she has come to realize that much of her success can be attributed to luck. Hannah found that she just tended to downplay the role of luck, as she was afraid it made her appear as though she didn’t know what she was doing. She then reviewed a mistake she made which was simply stopping at “study what worked.” Instead, she admits the saying should have finished with “and find out why it worked.” When it comes to PR, ask yourself these six questions: What stories were told in the pieces?Did the coverage of the piece feed into something else that was happening in the news cycle?Were there waves of coverage that led to the success of the piece?What emotions did this story invoke?What vertices covered the story?Did the piece get coverage in multiple countries? She then closed by sharing a piece of misinformation she has been fueling: that it’s normal to be wildly successful. It’s not. Hannah assured us that only 10% of the pieces she’s been part of have generated notable results. Humans are great at spotting patterns. We're less great at figuring out whether or not patterns are meaningful. @hannah_bo_banna #MozCon— Ruth Burr Reedy (@ruthburr) July 12, 2022 E-Commerce SEO Horror Stories: How to Tackle the Most Common Issues at Scale and Avoid an SEO Nightmare — Aleyda Solis Aleyda brought so much energy to the stage as she spoke about e-commerce SEO. No matter the amount of tools we have access to as e-commerce SEOs, it’s still true that our job is really hard, which makes it very easy to overlook detrimental mistakes. The first mistake Aleyda covered was allowing any and all internal search results to be indexable. This can create duplicate or thin content, and an overall poor user experience that will hurt your bottom line. While this is scary, the solution isn’t terribly complex, you could just canonicalize or 301 redirect these links to relevant facet pages. Another mistake she discussed was poor unique descriptive content on product pages. The consequence of this mistake can be hundreds or even thousands of “crawled, not indexed” pages in Search Console. Google marks these pages as duplicate or thin content and therefore deem them unworthy of indexing. To combat this problem you will want to add unique images, use descriptive language in your copy, incentivize reviews on product pages, and use structured data. By putting this effort in, Google will recognize that the product is unique and reward the page by indexing it. Alternatively, you may not want to index each page, instead you may want to focus on those facet pages. These are just two of the issues Aleyda covered in her talk, but if we tried to cover all seven as in-depth as she was able to, we would be here all day. If you want to see all seven horror stories and how to defeat them, pick up the video bundle and watch her talk. Believe us, it’s worth it for this talk alone. Anybody in e-commerce taking notes? This is the second person to talk about cannibalization on your sites. @aleyda bringing the brutal truth! #MozCon— Jason Dodge (@dodgejd) July 12, 2022 There is still one day left!
