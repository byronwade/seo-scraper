By: Rand Fishkin May 1, 2007 Podcast - Rand Gets Interviewed on Paid Links, Edu & Gov Links, SEO Tactics, Keyword Tools & More Advanced SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. A couple weeks ago, Sara Smith of Search-This interviewed me for her Podcast and it turned out terrifically well. Subjects include: Paid link reporting - Will it have a big impact? Who will it influence? Edu & Gov Links - Are they more valuable than regular domains? Why does the Page Strength Tool use them? Optimizing for Google vs. Yahoo! - What's the difference? 60 Seconds on Best Practices - (I actualy took about 100) Keyword Research Tools - A Quick Overview Premium Content from SEOmoz - Why did we do it? What do you get? A Little Personal Information - at the end, I give my life goal :) Watch out, though. When you get to the blog entry page, you'll need to look over on the right hand side for this Flash widget:You have to click on the \"Rand Fishkin\" link at the bottom, then hit \"play\" inside the iPod icon. Usability on that is a bit lacking, but the content is cool. I'm gonna have to check out Sara's other interviews. Whoops... Nevermind, I'm the first one! I'll have to check them out as she does them, then :) Copied! Back to Top",
