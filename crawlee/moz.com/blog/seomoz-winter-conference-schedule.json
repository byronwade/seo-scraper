Table of Contents Copied! By: Jennifer Sable Lopez February 9, 2010 SEOmoz Coming To a City Near You (Kinda) SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The holidays are long over, 2010 is well underway, we've already launched a new product, made a big announcement... and it's barely February! While our amazing development and product teams are busily building new tools as I type (and I'm not even kidding, those guys work a lot), some of us are hitting the road. For the next couple months, the SEOmoz team will be galavanting across the globe attending, speaking and even keynoting (yea.. is that a word?) at multiple Search Marketing Conferences. Essentially, in the next 45 days there's an opportunity to see one of us at a city near you... or somewhat near you... or at least in the same country... or possibly the same continent. Anyway, you get the picture. Following is a detailed list of where you can find us over the next couple months. Being a part of such an amazing community means the world to us, so please if you're attending any of these events, stop by and say hello. We'd really love to meet you. (Unless of course you're a stalker, then make sure to look for either Sam Niccolls or Danny Dover... They'd LOVE to meet you.) Without further ado, here's the list! OnlineXcellence - Glasgow - February 12 Kicking off this international tour, Rand will be presenting to business owners and CEOS during a day of SEO training at OnlineXcellence. Let me tell you something... SES London - February 15-19 This is the first of many trips to London this year for the mozzers. SES London is known for having great content, and this year one of my favorite speakers, Avinash Kaushik is giving one of the keynotes. Rand will be attending and speaking at the following sessions: PPC or SEO? The Ultimate Search Marketing Battle Social Media Best Practices for Marketers Inside the Brand OMS San Diego - February 22-25 At OMS San Diego, Rand is organizing a panel of Search Marketing leaders who will be discussing advanced tactics at the SEO 2.0 Leadership Forum. Rand will also be speaking on the panel, \"PR, Social Media and Search\". Miva Merchant - San Diego - February 24-26 The mozzers will be camping out in San Diego for a few days! For the Miva Merchant conference, Gillian is speaking on three sessions while Rand is keynoting about SEO on the second day. SMX West - Santa Clara - March 2-4 This will be my first SMX West and you'll find me volunteering in the In House Track on day 3. Rand is speaking on the Link Building Fundamentals panel, which looks pretty awesome. I'll have the flip video camera, so be sure to hunt me down, maybe you'll make it onto a Whiteboard Friday. Use the code \"smx10seomoz\" to get a 10% discount at SMX West! Gillian Speaking in India Last Year SphinnConn - Jerusalem - March 4-7 SphinnConn Jerusalem is the first of it's kind.

MVIXcon Dubai & Cairo - March 8-11 Gillian is looking forward to addressing a Women in Business group at MVIXcon in Dubai and to a meeting with members of the Royal Family during her visit. SearchFest 2010 Portland - March 9 Just a skip, hop and a jump from us, we'll be heading to SearchFest 2010 which has an amazing lineup of speakers.

MountainWest RubyConf - Salt Lake City - March 11-12 The MountainWest RubyConf is an excellent Ruby conference, which is our preferred dev language at SEOmoz. It will be a good opportunity to meet others doing cool things with the language and to get to know the community more personally. SXSW Interactive - Austin - March 12-16 Danny Dover will be at SXSW Interactive joining and talking with the literally 10,000s of other attendees. The technology conference is aimed at all things interactive (Websites, Video Games, Movies).

(Yes they exist, yes they are in Texas) IMC Calgary - March 16-17 As part of Gillian's world wide tour 2010, she'll be speaking at IMC Calgary on the The Power Triumvirate of 2010: The Convergence of Social-Mobile-Local.

The Freemium Summit - The Business of Free - San Francisco - March 26 The Freemium Summit was recommended by Dharmesh Shah as a good conference for folks who have free offerings as an important part of their business plan. Sarah will be attending and it's a great opportunity to learn and network with other entrepreneurs.
