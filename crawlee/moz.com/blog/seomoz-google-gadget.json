P By: Patrick Sexton October 29, 2007 SEOmoz Google Gadget Moz News This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Here is a new gadget that displays four things from SEOmoz besides the blog. I am going to just put a screenshot of it here, but you can see it live on SEOish. To add it to iGoogle you can click the \"add to Google\" button below. The first tab shows a random \"Whiteboard Friday\" video. Have you seen all 30+? The second tabs shows random videos that feature Rand or other Mozzers (interviews and such). The third tab is for YOUmoz--it displays the YOUmoz feed. The fourth tab links to some great SEOmoz resources. This is a Google gadget, and just like any other Google gadget it can be added with one click to your iGoogle page. It can also be customized and placed on any webpage (or blog post). Copied!
