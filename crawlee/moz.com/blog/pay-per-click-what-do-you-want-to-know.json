M By: macz_g October 9, 2007 Pay Per Click - What Do You Want to Know? Paid Search Marketing (PPC) This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Before bashing out a post on running a profitable Pay Per Click campaign, I wanted to ask you \"What do you want to know?\" I have been running through topics in my head for my first YOUmoz post for quite some time. Each one was interesting, exciting, and innovative, but would you find it valuable enough to spend 5 minutes to read? And, more importantly, would you put these principles into practice? In the spirit of SEOmoz, I thought it best to take the easy way out and Ask the Audience. Whether you want to know the basics of setting up a paid search campaign or you need to know how to increase relevance - I'd like to help. So I'd like to ask the SEOmoz community \"What do you want to know about PPC?\" Please reply in the comments and I'll follow up with a series of posts on the most popular requests. Copied!
