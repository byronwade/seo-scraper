We help you coast through your rankings analysis to gain some actionable insights, from tracking your performance against your competitors to making impactful improvements to your pages. Start Your Moz Pro Free Trial Segment and sort keyword rankings One constant in SEO is that ranking positions are always changing. Some keywords tend to move around more than others, and they can be tricky to spot. Luckily, Moz Pro has a simple way to focus on these keywords. In this Daily Fix, Maddie shows you how you can sort out your keywords by ranking gains and losses, so that you can glean some insight into how to make the relevant improvements. View rankings over time and vs. competitors They say you can't manage what you don't measure. This is also true for SEO.By tracking your keywords, you can measure the impact of your SEO efforts and identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities to optimize your SEO.Moz Pro allows you to track your ranking performance over time. You can quickly see exactly what page on your site is ranking in the highest position for a particular keyword, as well as other pages that may be ranking for the same keyword. This helps you easily flag potential keyword cannibalization on your site.In this Daily Fix, Jo on the Learning Team will show you exactly how this works. On-page optimization There aren’t many things more confusing than seeing pages rank for keywords that have absolutely nothing to do with your business. You're always signaling something to the search engines — whether you intend to or not. Optimizing your on-page SEO ensures you control that signal. On-page SEO is the practice of optimizing individual web pages for specific keyword(s) in order to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines. In this Daily Fix, I show you how to use the page optimization tool to improve your on-page SEO. Be sure to check out our post on on-page ranking factors if you want more tips. Compare link profiles Link building is one of the aspects of SEO that can't be done in isolation. In order to know how much effort you should dedicate to link building, you first need to look at your competitive landscape. Moz Pro's Link Explorer allows you to compare the link profile of up to five websites. In a snapshot, you get insight into many important metrics like domain authority, spam score, external and follow links, etc. You can easily use the graphs to spot trends in the type of links your competitors are getting, and even click through to see the individual links. In this video, Alicia shows you how. For more tips on building links, check our Beginner’s Guide to Link Building. All crawled pages Technical SEO is table stakes, and arguably the most important aspect of your SEO work. Even if you use the right keywords, create the most optimized pages, and have every authoritative site in the world linking to you, if the crawlers are’t able to index your pages correctly or you’re not following best technical SEO practices, your pages won't rank as well as they deserve. Moz Pro's Site Crawl tool helps you ensure that your technical SEO is on point.In this Daily Fix, Emilie shows you some tips you can use to improve your rankings with Site Crawl. Copied!
