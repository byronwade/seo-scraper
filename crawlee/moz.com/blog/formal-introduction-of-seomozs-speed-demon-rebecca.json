By: Rand Fishkin April 27, 2006 Formal Introduction of SEOmoz's Speed Demon - Rebecca Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Shame on me for taking almost 2 months to post on the addition of Rebecca Kelley to our team at SEOmoz. Rebecca started out as an intern through the Univ. of WA and became totally indispensable.

Rebecca's hoping for a very small prince I'm also hoping to send Rebecca to SES Latino in Miami as she's a fluent Spanish speaker and needs a chance to meet the industry folks.
