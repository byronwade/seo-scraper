K By: Kamanashish Roy April 3, 2008 SEO By Google Search Engines This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. The story ends here. We should better say the story has ended much before it even actually started. Google (Tom Phillips) has announced to sell off Performics. They are yet to select the buyer, but some of Google’s current partners are very much interested in taking over the company. So, if you were planning to optimize or market your site straight from or via Google (I mean Performics), you should start thinking differently (lol). Jokes apart, do you really think if Google optimized or marketed your website, they would have done something great or would they have given you some advantage over others in your niche? And what measures would Google have taken to optimize your site? Do you think Google would have taken a link back from your site with the anchor text SEO by Google? And more importantly, how much would Google charge for the service and how long it would take to get you a number one ranking in Yahoo or MSN for competitive keywords? Should we announce any gifts for the best guess? Copied! Back to Top",
