J By: JasonThomas13 February 8, 2007 Where to Submit Your Site to Search Engines Moz News This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. A lot of people ask, \"Where do I submit my site to search engines?\" If you're new to SEO, it's a lot easier than you think. You see all these advertisements proclaiming that for $20 they will submit your site to 10,000 search engines. Well, the truth is, that's a scam. There aren't 10,000 search engines, at least not 10,000 that will end up delivering any traffic to your site. At the time I'm writing this, the only ones you need to worry about are the BIG 3 - that is Google, MSN, and Yahoo. They reach about 98% of the web, so everything else is a waste of time. Besides, many of the smaller search engines get their results from the BIG 3, or they spider the BIG 3 to look for sites to include. So, if you get listed in the BIG 3, you'll basically cover the whole web. There are a few exceptions, but for now this is all you need to worry about. The URLs for the BIG 3 to submit your site: Google: http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl MSN: http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.aspx Yahoo: http://submit.search.yahoo.com/free/request Copied!
