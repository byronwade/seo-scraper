By: Gillian Muessig August 15, 2007 Where to Park Your Bumbershoot In Seattle in October SEO - Training Seminar Travel Info SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. If you’re coming to spend the day with Rand and party the night away with the Mozzers on October 1 (for the SEOmoz Seminar), here’s info about where to stay: WATERTOWN HOTEL 4242 Roosevelt Way NE Seattle, WA 98105 (206) 826-4242 Rate: $149/night Includes: Room, parking, breakfast, high speed internet access, use of the hotel’s bicycles and helmets, and complimentary shuttle service (7AM – 7:30PM). We’ve held a limited number of rooms at this rate. To get the discounted rate, tell reservations that you are attending the SEOmoz Training Seminar. If you want to come to Seattle for the weekend before the seminar, call early, as the rooms will go quickly. The Watertown offers a cooked hot breakfast each morning and has a fine wine bar open from 5-9 nightly. Although it’s just a short walk to Kane Hall at the University of Washington (UW), where the seminar will be held, a free shuttle with service to the UW, downtown Seattle and other locations runs every hour. Reserve a space the night before. You’ll be in the University District. There are ample restaurants, coffee shops, bookstores, bars, and pubs in the neighborhood. Getting to the Hotel Cabs are available at the airport. Cab fare is a flat rate of $35 to the University District plus tip. Cabs may charge extra for additional passengers sharing a cab. We recommend Seattle S&A Town Car service: 206.459.7903. One-way service to or from SeaTac airport is $40 [$35.00 + $5] tip for one-to four passengers. S&A also offers a Lincoln Navigator for up to 7 passengers for $70 for larger groups. Call S&A at least 24 hours in advance to arrange for a pick up at the airport. Shuttle Express offers scheduled shuttle service with a round trip cost of $40 for most rides. Very late arrivals or very early departures may incur an additional charge. Call (800) 487-7433 or make reservations online at least 24 hours in advance. PS. A bumbershoot is an umbrella. Copied! Back to Top",
