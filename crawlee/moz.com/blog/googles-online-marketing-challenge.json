C By: ClickMagnet67 February 25, 2008 Google's Online Marketing Challenge User Experience (UX) This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I've been following the Google's Online Marketing Challenge with great interest, and I find a part of me is really angry and a part of me thinks this is a phenomenal marketing tool and a great opportunity for college students. They'll be posting the results in June -- so I'll keep you posted! Here's the crux of the competition from Google's page: \"Student teams will receive US$200 of free online advertising with Google AdWords and then work with local businesses to devise effective online marketing campaigns. You will outline a strategy, run your campaign, assess your results and provide the business with recommendations to further develop their online marketing. Teams submit their reports and are judged by a panel of independent academics from all over the world.\" The anger comes from the fact that Google is having college students provide Google Adwords to companies for FREE - albeit it's only a $200 budget running from 2/10 - 3/24, but they are working with 200 small businesses who have not been in the online marketing realm yet and I'm wondering how much these college students are going to do in the way of harm through inexperience. Yes, I know, it's such a negative attitude, but I have a problem with inexperienced people in the business giving out the wrong advice. The genius, however, is Google's approach to marketing. What better way to advertise your business than to let college students spend money and work for you for free -- oh, and bringing along 200 perspective clients to boot! :) There is also the part of me that is glad these students will get firsthand knowledge of Adwords and the experience working with a small budget and clients. It's important for them to know there are strategies that go along with online campaigns and that we don't just pull keywords out of a jar. I hope they enjoy the competition and maybe bring some great ideas to improving Adwords! Copied! Back to Top",
