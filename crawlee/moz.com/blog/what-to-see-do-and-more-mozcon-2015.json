Agua Verde, recommended by Rachael Kloek \"Agua Verde serves great Mexican food in a beautiful lakefront setting. You can rent paddleboards and kayaks right under the restaurant to paddle your way around Lake Union.\" Ballard brewery blocks, recommended by Chris Lowe \"A dozen really good breweries all within a few blocks of each other: Stoup, Reubens, Red Envelope, Populuxe, Peddler, Maritime, etc., etc. You can easily walk from one brewery to another. Bonus is that most of these breweries host food trucks on the weekends. The area is also just a few blocks from downtown Ballard and the Burke Gilman Trail.\" Ballard Locks, recommended by Renea Nielsen \"The Ballard Locks are a bit of a trek from downtown Seattle (~ 45 min. by bus), but they are a perfect Seattle maritime adventure. The Locks abut a beautiful park and show off Seattle's maritime history. If you're lucky, you may even find some sea lions playing in one of the closed Locks.\" Pike Place Market, recommended by Erica McGillivray \"May seen like a 'touristy' spot, but Pike Place Market actually thrives on local business. Every day, there's a farmer's market, flowers galore, and artisans on everything from cheese and spices to woodworking and jewelry. There are hidden shops (at least three bookstores) and a ton of great food.\" Elliot Bay Books, recommended by Rand Fishkin \"One of the best indie bookstores in the country, stocked with good stuff to buy and read, and there's a lovely cafe, too.\" Ferry ride, recommended by Nemecia Kaloper \"Takes you to such cool places and allows you to see the city from different view and get a taste of our awesome islands! It requires usually at least 1/2 a day, but is well worth it to be able to hop over and have lunch somewhere other than the city. It's easy to never take the trip, but well worth it if you do. I recommend Bainbridge in particular and Nola Cafe.\" The Fremont Troll, recommended by Kevin Loesken \"The Fremont Troll, and Fremont in general, perfectly sums up what's great about Seattle. The troll itself is an amazing piece of art. It's also near the Lenin Statue and close to a lot of interesting bars, restaurants, and shops.\" Rodeo Donuts!, recommended by David Lee \"Best donuts ever. Even better than Voodoo in Portland, OR. This needs to be a 150 characters long so once again, best donuts ever. I really like the donuts here. Don't go to Krispy Kreme or Top Pot.\" Vivace: the Cafe Nico, recommended by Abe Schmidt \"The Cafe Nico best coffee drink in this city. Orange/nutmeg/ cinnamon paired with the greatest espresso pull in the country (only machine in the world capable of the 'perfect' espresso shot).\" Starbucks Roastery, recommended by Ben Simpson \"Just a few blocks from the convention center, the Starbucks Roastery is one of biggest new attractions in Seattle. Why? To start, walking it it feels like Willy Wonka had one to many espresso shots and got inspired. Starbucks pulled together its best baristas from around the country to put together some amazing craft coffee creations. And to top it all off, they've got a Serious Pie on location making all of their delicious food. If you do nothing else during your visit, the Starbucks Roastery is an absolute must!\" And Mozzer favorite restaurants and bars opened since last MozCon Trove, 500 E Pike St Nacho Borracho, 209 Broadway E Kukai Ramen & Izakaya, 320 E Pine St Kracken Congee, 88 Yesler Way Looking for more options?
