S By: ShadowShield April 16, 2008 Proof That Google Lacks Quality SERPs Search Engines This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I'm sure most of you out there already know that Google has its flaws, but for the most part it runs like a well oiled machine. I spent a long time working on ranking well in Google, and I've found a new problem that may not even apply to most people. Once you rank number 1 for an extended period of time, you become a trusted source for that keyword. Now I'm sure you are wondering, how is this a problem? Let's say you work hard, sweat blood, dream Google, then bam! One day you decide to totally change direction. It was a great run, you've been #1 for months and months, you even have that neat address link at the bottom of your result. That is all fine, but now comes the problem. You wipe the site, design a new look, new content, new pictures, research your market, pay close attention to the keywords and title and every other meta tag, but now here is the kicker. You post the new website and Google, like the buzzard it is, bites on your pages, indexes them, even caches them. You notice in your Google webmaster tools area that it still visits your site often, but when you continue to search for your old keyword term, you are still there, only your title and description have changed to the new content. This is not related to the keywords, but you basically look like a naked man standing in the center of a tiger exhibit at the zoo. Why are you there? They cached your website with the new terms, they see the terms have changed, but hey, they like you where you were, you're now stuck there forever, forget changing your keywords, you cant! Is this Google's way of saying HA HA? You tell me. The example is a real problem i am dealing with right now. Google search \"Knoxville computer repair.\" Yep that's me, right there at number 1. I don't belong there anymore, and does it not look strange sitting there above all the \"relevant\" content listed? I have lost all faith in Google's ability to display quality, up to date results.
