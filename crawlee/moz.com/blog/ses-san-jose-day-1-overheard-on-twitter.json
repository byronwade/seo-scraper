By: Jennifer Sable Lopez August 11, 2009 SES San Jose Day 1 - Overheard on Twitter SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. This week I'm at SES San Jose covering the conference for SEOmoz. I'm a one woman show so I'm putting my multi-tasking skills to the test! Obviously I can't make it to every session, or cover every track. Plus there are many others live blogging the event (Check out Bruce Clay's coverage and Search Engine Roundtable). So, how can I make sure the SEOmoz community gains as much information as possible from this conference? Reuse other people's content, that's how! People are tweeting from the conference sessions using either #SESSJ or #SES hashtags and giving up some great information they're learning. Now, you could fish through the results yourself or you can read through the tweets below and learn some great, actionable information. I looked for tweets that gave us something new or reminded us of things we often forget. So here goes... (These are more or less in order by time but a few may be out of order... don't shoot me. :)) Overheard at SES San Jose on Tuesday, August 11, 2009 imeldak: Theme already developing at this year's #SESSJ conf: It's not about the tools & technology.

That's a lot to take in. There were tons of retweets, promotional tweets and fun/goofy tweets that I left out. Perhaps I'll put a compilation together of the fun tweets. For example, the biggest drama going on today was the fact that Matt Cutts got a new haircut and no one recognized him for quite a while. Not necessarily actionable information, but definitely fun to stay on top of. Please let me know if there are any specific tweets I may have missed. See you all again tomorrow! PS. Please say hi if you see me! I can sometimes be shy. Unfortunately I don't have yellow shoes or anything like that, so it will be like picking a needle out of a haystack. :) Copied! Back to Top",
