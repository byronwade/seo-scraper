By: Rand Fishkin December 24, 2005 My Top 10 Favorite Things About SEO Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. What a great year. Honestly - I could never have imagined a 12 month period in which so much growth and exposure has exploded on our small SEO firm, nestled snuggly in the far Northwest corner of the US. Spending some time away from work over the holidays has made me realize just how much I love my job and how lucky I am to be able to go into work every day feeling excited and hopeful about what the day has in store. I thought that on this Christmas/Hanukkah eve, I'd share some of my favorite things about the SEO industry, so, in reverse order: 10. Link Building - It could also go on my least favorite list too, but there's something immensely satisfying about watching a link campaign slowly work its way through the SERPs, first pushing up rankings at MSN, then Yahoo! and eventually, Google (and Ask Jeeves later the next year). 9. Forum Moderation - The moderators at the SEO forums see some crazy stuff, and always have reason to laugh. The community that's built between teams of folks who regulate the junk and keep pointless squabbling to a minimum is great, too. 8. Reading Technical Papers - There's a solid satisfaction that comes from slogging through a patent application, white paper or IR conference submission and feeling that you've taken something positive away - particularly when it opens you up to new ideas about how rankings might work now or in the future. 7. Emails from Strangers - My favorite emails are the ones from small webmasters in remote corners of the world who just need a little help getting their site off the ground. Referring someone successfuly to a forum, post or page that can help them get their problem solved is a fulfilling experience. 6. Religious Debates - White Hat vs. Black Hat or Sandbox vs. no-box or keyword density vs. term vector theory; all are fascinating to watch develop - I hope it doesn't grow tiresome to me like it has for so many. I love it when folks come around to my point of view, or, better yet, when I change my mind (it's happened more than once!) 5. Blogging - As Todd notes, it's wonderful to be able to share your experience, knowledge and tips with a wide community and get feedback. I love how the SEO blogosphere has grown and I'm excited about making SEOmoz an even better place in 2006 - definitely a craft that requires attention to detail and passion, too. 4. The Instant Gratification of the SERPs - In SEO, if you work hard and work smart, you end up with high rankings. It's a beautiful reward because traffic starts flowing immediately, and continues as long as you do your job well - there aren't many industries where such instantaneous success is both measurable and instantly gratifying. 3. SEO Conferences - Meeting people online is great, but seeing them in person and shooting the breeze in hallways, conference rooms and crowded bars is truly a privilege. If you haven't been to an SES or Pubcon yet, make time in 2006. 2. Running an Ethical Business - In a seedy field, as SEO is often considered, you stand out when you speak honestly, consistently help people and present truly beneficial resources for free. So many people in SEO offer their time and energy pro bono to help others learn the craft or apply it to their own sites and that makes me want to stay in this business for a long time. 1. The People - By some miralce, the people in the SEO business are among the most open, kind, honest, resourceful and sharing in the business world. I know that many of us have operated in other fields in our lives and every time I sit down with colleagues, we all note how amazingly community-oriented and supportive the field is. There's no doubt that I couldn't be where I am now without the help of dozens of men and women that I admire. Rather than one or two giant shoulders to stand on, in SEO, we have thousands of outstretched hands lifting us ever higher. It's truly an honor and a pleasure to be a part of this community.
