J By: jwest5150 March 11, 2008 Google Ads for Free?!?!? Paid Search Marketing (PPC) This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. You may have seen a promotion the last week or so for an eBook on sale through ClickBank, which promises their new technique will allow you to have all of your Google AdWords ads run for free. Basically, their “talking” sales page states, “Just insert a simple piece of code onto your web site, landing page, etc. and get all of your Google ads for free.” I know what your first reaction is ... scam. Me too. But I was a little curious as to what their angle was, so I bought it. It’s a 120+ page eBook and it took them 82 pages or so to give the answer … It is awesome. The piece of code allows for an outside company to sell links on your site (a la Text Link Ads) and you get a percentage. They emphasize that you don't have to do anything, this other company handles it all. Basically, they are selling you an eBook to promote an affiliate program. No, not one for their eBook, but for the linkage company. Talk about your \"double dipping\" ...earn $67 from the sale of the eBook and hope to get 20-30% to signup with the linkage company and add more revenue from the kick back on the signups. Pretty slick scam, if you ask me. So, let me see if I get their line of logic correct. “Getting your Google ads for free” means selling advertising on your site and using the money from the ads to pay for your Google ads. Please. Even if you can get $50.00 per ad per month and sell ten spots, that’s only $500.00 a month. I go through that in AdWords per day. I know this is stretching it, but using their logic I could tell you that I have the secret of getting your home for free. You see, you go out and get a job and you use that money to pay for your mortgage! Marketers like this should be shot on sight. Copied! Back to Top",
