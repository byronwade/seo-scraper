By: Rand Fishkin December 11, 2005 Newsweek Article Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. It's been quite a week - first a slashdotting, now an article in Newsweek. The print edition is coming out tomorrow, but you can read the article online here. I think the title is supposed to be \"Hotwiring your Search Engine Rankings,\" though.Congrats to Earl Grey, as well, who was mentioned as the black hat in the article - he's also the only reason I'm mentioned. It was Earl (from the spam debate) who referred the reporter to us. Thanks, Earl. I owe you a big one.I'm a little humbled by all the attention - hopefully it's something that will be positive for all of the industry.P.S. This is a version of the article that was going to be in Wired, and thanks are due to Brad Stone (I'm linking to his brand new blog) of Newsweek (who wrote both versions) for keeping the story alive.P.P.S. This photo is not representative. I'm no fashion model and the shot with the sunglasses was only one of dozens - I guess they don't like my eyes :) (which reminds me, thanks to Gabriela Hasbun for making my mom and I look so great).P.P.P.S. Why is my mom in the photo? Gillian actually founded the company in 1981 (under a different name, of course) and we've been working together through good times and bad for 8 years. I couldn't ask for a better business partner. Copied! Back to Top",
