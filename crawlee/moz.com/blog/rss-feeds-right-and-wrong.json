O By: OliverTaco March 3, 2008 RSS Feeds - Right and Wrong Marketing Psychology This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. My list of RSS feeds is divided into three big buckets - News, SEO, and Politics. And I happened to notice something pretty interesting. Where is the Monkey in This Picture? Here is a screen shot of a blog post we wrote when we launched Digg Friend Finder: And here is a post on Instapundit: Right, we should all have the luxury of a bazillion readers a day who will (like me) put up with stuff like that. (Note that I am not climbing onto my partial-article-feed hobby horse!) Who Makes an Effort? Well, it turns out that it depends on what \"make\" means: 42 SEO feeds, 126 posts reviewed: 0% mangled text, 65% of posts had a graphic or something visual 55 news feeds, 165 posts reviewed: 10% mangled text, 0% graphics (excepting posted videos) 25 political news feeds, 75 posts reviewed: 25% mangled text, 0% graphics (excepting cartoons and videos) What's Up With That? I think the graphics thing is explicable, but I don't really have an explanation for not caring that your text is mangled. Has anyone else thought about this and come up with a good explanation?
