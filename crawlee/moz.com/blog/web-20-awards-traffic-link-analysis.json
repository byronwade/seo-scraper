I promised a friend that we've have the data related to SEOmoz's Web 2.0 Awards posted today and I'd hate to dissapoint. I'm providing statistics from launch in the early morning of Tuesday, March 28 to today - a total of 10 days (8 weekdays). Traffic (unique visits): March 28, 2006 Tue 19,636March 29, 2006 Wed 20,667March 30, 2006 Thu 12,825March 31, 2006 Fri 7,777April 01, 2006 Sat 4,061April 02, 2006 Sun 3,838April 03, 2006 Mon 6,221April 04, 2006 Tue 5,518April 05, 2006 Wed 5,126 April 06, 2006 Thu 3,992 (until 3:20pm PDT) Referring Links: 11,066 referring URLs sent traffic, from 2477 unique domainsTop 25 Referrers: http://digg.com http://del.icio.us http://www.cssbeauty.com http://www.stumbleupon.com http://cssmania.com http://www.nnm.ru http://www.pixelsurgeon.com http://blog.searchenginewatch.com http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com http://tek.sapo.pt http://www.msnbc.msn.com http://www.downloadsquad.com http://popurls.com http://doci.nnm.ru http://www.marketingfacts.nl http://cssbeauty.com http://www.netvibes.com http://solidot.org http://blog.donews.com http://www.micropersuasion.com http://mail.google.com http://www.blinklist.com http://blog.centraldesktop.com http://www.postshow.net http://www.furl.net #22 is pretty interesting, but my favorite referrer, who isn't on the list, was Alexa's \"Movers & Shakers\" page. We're at #9 with a 1,600% increase in traffic: As far as search engine stats, it's still too early to say. Yahoo!'s reporting 17,400 links (using the last page method to get greater accuracy). Google is ranking the site #3 for Web 2.0 Awards, so it's possible we've dodged the sandbox, but I won't have any true data until it's been indexed for at least 3 weeks. I think it fits the model of \"topical phenomenon\" fairly well, but my secret hope is that the domain does get sandboxed (box testing is the primary reason we launched it on its own domain rather than as an SEOmoz article). As I have more cool stats, I'll be posting them in this entry or the comments below - the research portion of the awards for SEO purposes was a major part of the project, and I plan to make all of that information public for SEOs to reference. It should certainly help bolster the case for a major, pressworthy launch as a methodology for link growth, rather than a traditional link building/requesting campaign. Copied! Back to Top",
