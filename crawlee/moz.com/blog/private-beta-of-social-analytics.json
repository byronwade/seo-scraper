By: Rand Fishkin September 21, 2011 Private Beta of Social Analytics in the PRO Web App: 1,000 Spots Available Moz Tools The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. In two weeks, we'll be making the first spots available for the beta of a highly anticipated (and heavily requested) feature: social media analytics inside the PRO web app. The beta will launch with Facebook and Twitter, and in months to come we may add LinkedIn and Google+. For now, though, we'd love to get up to 1,000 beta testers into the service - we need to run for ~1 month to study how the data collection performs and scales before we release it to everyone using PRO (14K+ accounts and 30K+ campaigns).Here's the link to the survey & signup. Just fill that out and when we're ready, we'll start adding you to the beta. Note that we might not be able to include everyone in the private beta, and it may be a trickle (50-100 accounts) in the first week or two (starting the first week of October).The social analytics feature is designed to track:Growth of your Twitter + Facebook accountsTraffic from Facebook + Twitter (via connection to Google Analytics)Key metrics from Twitter:FollowersRetweetsMost Retweeted Content@ Replies@ MentionsInteraction Analysis (see screenshot below)Key metrics from Facebook:FansLikesFan Posts (quantity of posts on your wall by fans)Mentions (any post to your wall that mentions your page's name)Admin Posts (your posts)Comparison of your FB/Twitter accounts against Competitors (for public data like fans/followers)Over time, there may be more functionality as well, but we wanted to start by tracking some of the key reach metrics that we've seen carry value (I mentioned a bunch of these in my post on social media KPIs).Here's a bunch of screenshots (note that some of these aren't finalized nor showing all the features): Hopefully, you're as excited as we are. If so, we'd love to have you join the beta by signing up here!Once we've done some thorough testing, we hope to have this rolled out to everyone using the web app in November, and will be iterating and improving thereafter. Thanks for all the support, and big kudos to the Moz engineering + product teams, who've put together something pretty damn cool here :-) Copied! Back to Top",
