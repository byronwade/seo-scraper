Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin February 12, 2005 SEO Links from Del.icio.us Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I've blogged previously on the subject of Del.icio.us, but this time I want to examine our own, specific field and the links that spring up from the tagging community. Del.icio.us has a large base of users, yet few of these issue SEO tags, probably because ours is not a well-known industry/acronym. However, the links that do crop up there tend to be relatively simplistic and often misleading. Perception about the practices and methodology of SEO could not be learned accurately from these. On the other side, tags like PHP, webdev & design all contain excellent content links that are not only valuable, but up-to-date and even, occassionally, cutting edge. There is a disconnect about the education and presentation of SEO on the web and sadly, it falls to us, the dedicated SEOs of the industry, to rectify this problem. So, for the first time, I'm urging you to participate not for your own education, but for the education and betterment of the web community as a whole. Visit Del.icio.us and tag SEO sites and pages that have great content, so the world can better see what we have to offer. This, of course, doesn't apply just to folksonomy sites, but to the PR of the whole industry. I'll present on this subject more as it crops up. Copied! Back to Top",
