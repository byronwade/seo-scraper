Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin October 15, 2004 Older Sites Succeeding? Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. In the initial testing of the survey, one fact that consistently appears in the results that rank in the top 10 are sites that have been around a long time. Obviously, these sites have had greater time to build links & content, but there appears to be little correlation between these items. The data seems to suggest that age by itself is playing a role in how Google is ranking websites. I'll continue to look for other factors that could be a result of age that are influencing results, as age alone seems like an unlikely factor to build an algorithm around. Copied! Back to Top",
