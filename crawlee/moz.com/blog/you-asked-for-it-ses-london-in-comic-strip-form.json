By: Rebecca Kelley February 23, 2007 You Asked For It: SES London in Comic Strip Form SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. In order to please the masses, Rand once again chained me to my desk and ordered me to do a recap of SES London in an amusing comic book fashion. Thanks to Jeff and his spiffy MacBook (ComicLife yo!), this time I was able to create this batch of comics much easier than SES Chicago's Flash-tastrophe. Thanks, Jeff! Anyway, I hereby present to you SES London: The Comic Strip. Special thanks to Liana Evans, Alex Bennert, and Becky Ryan for contributing some photos. Also, thanks to Scott for his wonderful artistic skills--he really captured the essence of Allan choking on his dinner. By the way, this strip is a bit bigger than Chicago's (after all, Europe is slightly more photogenic than sub-zero Chi-Town), so hopefully your comps won't get bogged down. Oh, and if you like the project, feel free to send donations...I heard Rand grumbling the other day about \"monetization\" and \"wedding to pay for,\" so I'm sure SEOmoz would appreciate the tips. ;) P.S. I also need to give a HUGE shoutout to Frank Watson, Greg Boser, and his wonderful wife, Barbara, for an incredible time in Paris and at the hotel bar. Thanks! See you in New York! Copied!
