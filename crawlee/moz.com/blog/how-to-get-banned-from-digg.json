By: Rebecca Kelley October 27, 2006 How to Get Banned From Digg Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. These days it seems like everyone's written an article or blog entry on all things digg, e.g. why you shouldn't game digg, digg etiquette, whether digg is rigged. Jeff and I thought we'd join the bandwagon and offer our profound expertise on how to get banned from Digg: Tell digitalgopher that his mother was a hamster and his father smelt of elderberries, and then fart in his general direction. Have Alzheimer's, or be like Leonard from Memento. \"Oh, this digg website looks neat! I'll make a profile. Hey, this story seems cool! I'll digg it.\" Ten minutes later... \"Oh, this digg website looks neat! I'll make a profile. Hey, this story seems cool! I'll digg it...\" Undercut other users by submitting the exact same entry as theirs, only differentiating yours by adding \"Read this one instead! It's super-cool!\" in the title. Submit a story titled \"Top 10 Reasons Why Netscape is the Coolest Ever!\" Submit an article that has pictures of Kevin Rose spooning Owen Byrne. For each article on digg, post a comment that says, \"Lame. Dugg down because it looks so fake.\" Actually, since it's on digg it should look more like, \"laim. dug down bcoz it loks fak.\" Keep submitting stories like, \"How to Smuggle Explosives onto a Plane\" and \"Best Ways to Take Out a Government Building.\" This is also a good way to see what an FBI official looks like in person, though you'll probably be handcuffed as well. Or you could keep submitting stories that are nothing more than pictures of you wearing a tutu and covered in butterscotch. Trash Ubuntu and say SuSE is where it's at. Submit a story titled, \"Hey, Have You Seen This Cool Star Wars Kid Video?\" There you have it. Now you know, and knowing is half the battle. Copied! Back to Top",
