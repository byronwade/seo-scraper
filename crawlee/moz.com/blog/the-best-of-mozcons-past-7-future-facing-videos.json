By: Erica McGillivray June 5, 2014 The Best of MozCons Past: 7 Future-Facing Videos SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The countdown to MozCon—July 14-16 in Seattle—is on! We've finalized the agenda and our speaker selection, put in our swag orders, and choreographed happy dances for Roger. We're also counting down as ticket sales speed up and are getting closer to selling out. That means: For the best MozCon deal, make sure you take a 30-day free trial and register as a Moz Subscriber. If our software's not for you, cancel at anytime, and we'll still look forward to seeing you at MozCon. To get you a little more excited, we're sharing these seven future-forward videos from talks from our past two MozCons. This is the first time that these videos have been available for free! That's right, all-new content just for you because we love you. If each of these videos doesn't make you a little more happy to be part of this industry, thrilled to dive into your work, and overly-eager to attend MozCon yourself, then I suggest some cat video therapy. ;)1. Building a Winning Video Marketing Strategy with Phil Nottingham Tweet about this video Want more Phil? He'll be back on stage with \"YouTube: The Most Important Search Engine You Haven't Optimized For\" this year. He also rocked it on the blog last year with a strategy for the kind of videos you should create for your business. 2. The D-Word: Leading the Way to Great Design with Jenny Lam Tweet about this video You can never spend too much time thinking about your design and how to make it better. 3. Beyond 10 Blue Links: The Future of Ranking with Dr. Pete Meyers Tweet about this video Noted as the scariest presentation from last year, Dr. Pete takes you on a journey through the SERPs. Don't miss his \"How to Never Run Out of Great Ideas\" this year. 4. 35 Ways to Get Links with Paddy Moogan Tweet about this video And pencils down... Paddy will be bringing his great ideas and beer challenge back this year with \"Beyond SEO - Tactics for Delivering an Integrated Marketing Campaign.\" 5. Next Level Local Tactics: Making Your SEO Stand Out with Dana DiTomaso Tweet about this video \"Wow.\" That's pretty much what I thought after seeing this presentation live. Dana will be give a talk titled \"Prove Your Value\" this year. 6. A New Form of CRO with Joanna Lord Tweet about this video You'll never look at conversion rate optimization the same way again. 7. Strings to Things: Entities and SEO with Matthew Brown Tweet about this video Yep, Matthew basically predicted Hummingbird before it hit Google's Algo. Now are you ready for MozCon? Copied!
