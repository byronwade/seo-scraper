Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin November 3, 2005 Yahoo! Maps Beta - Taking Google to School Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Wow... I'm incredibly impressed by the new Yahoo Maps beta. Why do I love it? Zooms in on mouse wheel scroll Has labeled city districts on transparency overlay Can show live traffic Uses Yahoo! local data to show bars, restaurants, gas stations with 2 clicks on a menu Has a \"Send to Phone\" function Uses the euro-style maps like Google Killer API Functional use of browser back button (even though it uses Flash) This is an application that should get a lot of attention, though I fear the web community is already so obsessed with everything Google, they'll barely give it a look. Not me. I was planning on having some Google maps applications built, but now that I see this, I'm going to try Yahoo! instead. Copied! Back to Top",
