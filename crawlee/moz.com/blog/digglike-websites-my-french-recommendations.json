E By: Ella_D May 31, 2006 Digg-like websites: my French recommendations Content Marketing The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. This is for French readers or French audience, especially in Europe and Quebec. It talks about French digg-like websites. Our blog has hit the first page of major French 2.0 digg-like websites for approximately 28hours now . I think most of our French readers would like to know which sites seem to have taken much of the results. Keep in mind that the numbers are not on the same scale + I might be forgetting some other main digg-like French websites across the planet (any suggestions = make my day!). As a comparison, our blog has just been launched early in 2006 and there are still modifications that need to be implemented to offer a better experience to our readers and do a serious pr campaign, but we try our best to offer a (almost!) daily posting meanwhile. We had very little traffic, +/- 500 unique visitors a month, yet we see a slow growth and we try to dedicate ourselves more and more to it... At the time we speak, we've been \"scooped\" by Scoopeo.com and got 203 visits in 24hrs, we've got \"fuzzed\" by Fuzz.fr and got 147 visits, and we got \"slapped\" by Tapemoi.com and got 21 visits (although they do receive less traffic than Fuzz and Scoopeo, we also used a less attractive Title and we do believe it has skewed this result). For a site who's been used of having 500 visits / month, it generated ~500 visits / 1 day, and this is only our first post; nobody had ever heard about the blog nor had it bookmarked. Our blog offers a free 3rd party public statistic center that you can consult right there about the \"event\". Any other suggestions? Updates Nuouz (English people should read: News), which actually calls your page into its own site (I felt a bit cheated here, although they offered me to send it to my friends, which almost comforted me for a while). Weird but it did generated us 23 visits so far. Allactu (English people should read: All News), is a copy of TapeMoi.com, and doesn't have much traffic yet. BlogMemes, another small one, still I like the layout more than the Allactu / TapeMoi. Still, this one has some displaying issues (whoever did the integration didn't bother looking at the client view!) Copied! Back to Top",
