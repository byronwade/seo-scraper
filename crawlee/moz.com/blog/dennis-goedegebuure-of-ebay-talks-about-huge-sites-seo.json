B By: brunotorres September 23, 2010 SEO For Huge Sites: An Interview With Dennis Goedegebuure of eBay Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Have you ever wondered how hard it is to do SEO for a site as huge as eBay? In this video, Gillian Muessig, Co-Founder/President/SEOmom of SEOmoz interviews Dennis Goedegebuure, director of SEO at eBay. He talks about his work at one of the biggest sites of the world and the challenges he faces at it. This is the first video of a series of interviews shot by UOL HOST (which I work for) at Search Labs, the biggest Brazilian search conference to date, held in São Paulo in July 2010. In this interview they had a very nice chat about topics such as: Outsourcing to China Using the huge amount of data from eBay to create link baits The critical importance of the technical aspects of SEO for big sites Advanced tracking of crawling frequency and distribution May day update (ok, this sounds old, but still...) Universal search Tests with microformats, the impact they may have on the CTR in the SERPs Optimization for image search And a lot more. The video is in English, subtitled in Portuguese, so you can extract great value from the interview in both languages. Take a look at the video below and please, leave your opinions in the comments.
