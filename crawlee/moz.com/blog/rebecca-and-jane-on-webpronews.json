While Rebecca and I were in New York this past week, we sat down with Michael McDonald of WebProNews to discuss some social media issues. While Rebecca is upset that she has a large strand of hair partially covering her face, and I'm amused at the awful look on my face in the embedded player, we didn't come across too badly on the film so we decided to post it here. Many thanks to Michael for conducting a great interview, especially given the number of people he sat down in front of the camera with during the week. There seemed to be hardly a moment when the WebProNews camera wasn't rolling and Mike had his microphone in front of somebody. So, even though it isn't Friday and we didn't have a white board on hand, we hope you'll enjoy Rebecca's and my eight minutes and forty-nine seconds of fame... Copied! Back to Top",
