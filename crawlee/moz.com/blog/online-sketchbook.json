By: Rand Fishkin October 14, 2005 Online Sketchbook Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Back in the late '90's, I was obsessed with Flash design. I spent countless hours animating text and building organic-styled site designs. I gave up on that a long time ago, when I realized that true designers had something I lacked (namely talent) and that hard work can only take you so far. However, I still occassionally browse through my old stomping grounds and tonight I came across a nifty little site that showcases an animated portfolio of a very talented sketchbook artist. It's worth a peek if you've got a few minutes. The navigation isn't intuitive, however, you need to start by clicking the \"random\" button in the lower right-hand corner or use the flip page navigation at the top (on the book's pages). Copied!
