Table of Contents Copied! By: Jennifer Sable Lopez January 18, 2012 A Peek Under the Hood: How we Manage the SEOmoz Community Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Have you ever been a part of a community and wondered, “How does it all happen?” Well today is your lucky day! In the spirit of TAGFEE, I've decided to lift the Moz hood and show you what it takes to manage a large community. In fact, this is just the first post in a series of posts on Community Management. Today I'll be explaining the who, what, when, where and how of how we manage the SEOmoz community. It's important to know who are the people behind the scenes, keeping the community in order and running smoothly, just as much as it is to know what exactly we consider the community to be and how we do it. In the next posts, I'll dig deeper into subjects such as how we deal with negativity, how we gained over 100k Twitter followers and what we're planning to do for our Google+ strategy. For now, let's jump into the SEOmoz community and see how it's done. Who Are We? Over the last couple years, the community has grown immensely. It quickly became imperative to build a team to help take care of different aspects of the community. I simply couldn’t handle all aspects on my own anymore. So, before I jump too far into the what, why and how we manage the community, I’d like to introduce you to the “who.” Peter Meyers (aka Dr. Pete) Essentially Dr. Pete has been around the Moz community for about as long as Rand himself. :) No, really. He’s been an essential part of the community long before we even called it a community. Rand made the smart move long ago to bring Pete on board as an Associate. Pete spends much of his time answering questions in Q&A (you’d be amazed at how much stuff this guy knows!) and writing on the blog. In fact he’s written some of top content on the blog for the past three years. He pretty much makes the rest of us (ok except maybe Rand) look bad at our unworthy content. While he’s not helping manage the chaos of Q&A, writing on the blog, or being one of the funniest guys on Twitter, he runs User Effect, a successful usability and CRO company. Oh and if you’ve ever wondered if he’s a real doctor, read more here. Casey Henry Many of you may remember Casey from his excellent YouMoz posts that he wrote as a member of the community. The fact is, his community activity caught our eye and in 2010 we made him an Associate. At that time, he helped kill spam, answer questions in Q&A and did some dev work for us as well. It didn’t take long to realize that he was a great fit for Moz, so we hired him & moved him and his wife to Seattle. As the resident Marketing Ninja, he manages many marketing projects as well as a number of dev responsibilities. His part within the Community Team is to help keep track of, and kill spam, spammers and scammers. Whether that’s through comments, PMs or otherwise, he’s the man on the case. He’s also quite active in Q&A and can “woot,” “whee,” and “beep” with the rest of us on the SEOmoz Twitter account. You’ll often find him replying to Tweets to the SEOmoz account from his personal account, fixing link issues, answer questions and being an awesomely helpful guy. Aww. Keri Morgret Keri is well known in the industry as one of those amazing conference live-bloggers, and speaks about using negative keywords effectively for PPC. Having managed many forums and community sites in the past, including being a moderator at Sphinn, she is perfectly positioned to be a part of the Moz community team. Currently Keri works out of her home near San Francisco as a (mostly) full-time Associate and runs her business Strike Models (go check out the site, it’s super cool) with her husband. She has quickly become an integral part of the team as well as the community in general. As the main Mozzer leading YouMoz management as well as Q&A she interacts all day long with community members. Talk about stealth, you may not realize it, but Keri pretty much knows everything that’s going on all the time. You think I’m kidding… I’m not. Not only does she spend her time managing some of the on-site areas but she often helps out with the SEOmoz Twitter account as well. It can be a daunting task knowing that over 100k people will see your tweets (ok, in reality the number to actually see the tweets is quite less, but you get the point), but Keri jumps right in there. :) She’s also a huge help by cleaning out the Twitter “inbox” (more on that below) for me each morning. If you’re ever curious about what’s going on at any particular time within the Moz Community, Keri is your woman. Don't forget to follow her on Twitter. Erica McGillivray When we found out Erica was a founder as well as the President and Marketing Director of GeekGirlCon, we just knew she’d fit right into our community. :) With a background in SEO, Social, Email Marketing and event planning (pretty much marketing awesomeness) she easily jumped into the role of Community Attaché. Erica can essentially do anything and everything that has to do with managing the community. A ninja in her own right. On any given day, you’ll find her managing our email marketing, answering questions in Q&A, reading through YouMoz posts, Tweeting from the Moz account, setting up webinars and organizing the upcoming MozCon. Oh, and did I mention she’s a badass SEO? I’ve always felt strongly that you can’t manage a community unless you’re a part of the community yourself. Well Erica can talk the talk and walk the walk. Just be sure not to make her mad, she might pull these out. If you want to keep up with all of Erica's geekery, check her out on Twitter. Jen Lopez Oh hi! That’s me. :) Just a quick background, I have a degree in Journalism, emphasis in Public Relations, but spent 10 years as a web developer before I turned into an SEO. Got hired as an SEO Consultant with SEOmoz in early 2009, then in January 2010 we gave up consulting. Doh! Hello Community Management. It was at that point that I created the position and over the last few years it has grown into a real job. So what will you find me doing on an average day? I find myself Managing Twitter, Facebook & Google+, combating spam, answering questions in Q&A (usually that Keri or Erica assign me ;)), managing the blog schedule and content, responding to help tickets as needed, commenting on community posts outside of SEOmoz, tweeting from my personal account and any other random thing that comes up during the day. The truth is, my job rocks. Sure I deal with trolls sometimes, but that’s what makes the job interesting. Mozzers That’s you, you and YOU. Whether it’s Gianluca responding to a Tweet about SEOmoz while us West Coasters are sleeping or Ryan answering a question in Q&A about a technical PRO issue, you guys help us every day to manage the community. This is a very important aspect of the community and one that makes people want to be a part of it. It’s not just one person managing everyone else with an iron fist (OK I admit sometimes I have dreams this will happen ;), it’s all the Moz staff and community helping each other out. Holy. geeky. happiness. What Do We Do? Obviously there’s no way to really describe everything that we do in one blog post. When you work with a community, your day can change in an instant. Sometimes an issue comes up and you’re helping to manage an issue since you’re the public “face” of the community on the social sites. Other times you wake up to a hashtag being created and hundreds of posts being written about you. *huge grin* Let me take a few moments to walk you through the major aspects of managing the SEOmoz community. This really is only a high-level look at we do each day. The plan is to expand on many of these areas as separate blog posts. For now, here are the what, when how and who of what it means to manage the community. Blog When Rand started the SEOmoz blog years ago, I’m sure he never quite imagined that it would be the base of such an expansive and amazing community. It really has become the center of everything Moz. Think about this; an average blog post gets around 40 thumbs up, 50 comments and 800+ Tweets. That’s a lot to keep up with each day! What Since you’re already here you probably know that we post content not only about SEO, but about Inbound Marketing in general. We focus on creating actionable takeaways and look for authors who can bring something new to the community. We like to cover hot topics in the industry but we don’t necessarily cover them as “news.” We’ll also post new updates/improvements/issues about the PRO product on the blog as well. When We have at least one new post each day, and sometimes publish a second one during the day (Pacific U.S. time). How We have a custom blog editor that we use to create the posts. When it comes to managing comments, we have a system that helps us to moderate them if they meet a certain criteria. This way we don't allow a comment to get published if we suspect that it's spam, and one of us has to approve it. When it comes to comments and how we handle them, we take the community very seriously and will ban users if they don't \"play by the rules.\" This is an area that I'll dig into a bit deeper on another post, but essentially, you're in our home and we request that you handle yourself as a professional. Who I manage the blog schedule and make sure we have a post going up each night. The idea is to set the schedule at least a couple weeks out, with openings here and there for hot topics or new authors we want to introduce. All of us watch for spam comments throughout the day and Casey set up a way to moderate and kill spam before you guys ever even see it. :) The entire team helps manage the comments, detect spam and make sure things aren't getting out of hand anywhere. YouMoz Writing a post for YouMoz is a great way to get your name out in the community (remember above I mentioned Casey started out as a YouMoz author!), plus you get a nice link. ;) What Similar to the main blog, the community loves to read actionable posts. However, in YouMoz we do have a little more leeway than we do on the main blog. We’ll publish posts on topics that we don’t normally cover on the blog. The best part about that though is that if the post does really well in YouMoz and gets promoted to the main blog, then we see more diversity in the subjects. When We try to post at least one YouMoz post per day and some days we even have two. It used to take 6-8 weeks to get through the queue and now it’s only two weeks, tops! (A HUGE thanks to Keri for cleaning this up.) How Any member can create a blog post using our blog editor and submit it to be read by our editors. If it’s approved, it gets published to the YouMoz blog. We recently added a “Read Me First” page that has helped us to get higher quality posts submitted. Who Keri is the main point of contact when it comes to YouMoz. She’s done an excellent job cleaning up the queue and making it easier and quicker for authors to get their posts published. Whenever necessary, Erica and I also jump in and help by editing and approving content, declining posts, etc. When it comes to promoting YouMoz posts to the main blog, I’m usually the one that makes that decision. There is no “golden rule” on how to get promoted and it sometimes depends on whether there’s a spot open on the main blog. When it’s good, and the community likes it, it will get promoted. :) Q&A When we launched the new Q&A system last year, we honestly weren’t quite sure exactly how it would be received. We were pleasantly surprised to see how much people loved to both ask and answer questions! It took us a few months to get the hang of managing it properly, but with the help of the team, we’re quite happy with this PRO feature. What You’ll find pretty much any and every kind of content related (sometimes barely) to internet marketing. Since it is for PRO members only, it’s fairly easy to keep spam in check since they usually don’t like to pay money. What we mainly look for here is to make sure that people are keeping in line with our Community Guidelines. When Twenty-four hours a day the community is asking and answering questions. Plus since many of our Associates who answer questions live in London and other “across the pond” cities, we’re able to have coverage all day long. Whee! How This all happens through our own proprietary Q&A system. We get asked quite often if we built this ourselves or used an out-of-box solution. This is 100% a homegrown system, which does have its own set of bugs. :) This system is only about a year old and is about 500% better than the old Q&A. Who While Keri manages both private and public Q&A, Dr. Pete and Erica also play a heavy role here. Keri makes sure your private questions are answered by our team of staff and expert Associates. Dr. Pete and Erica are usually in there answering questions for a few hours each day as well. Many of our Associates play a role in Q&A and you’ll see a number of them answering questions and endorsing answers every day. Even Rand goes in quite often and replies to questions personally, even ones asking how to contact him. :) Social Community Over the past couple years our community has grown by leaps and bounds through the help of social media sites. You may have noticed that we engage quite heavily on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn. It’s not that we’ve ignored other sites; we just tend to focus our energies on these four. Since many of our members follow us on these sites in addition to the blog, we had to figure out a way to be somewhat unique in all areas. Nothing worse than content overkill (ok, yea yea there really are lots of things that are worse, but you get my point.) Here’s a quick walk through of how we manage these four social media sites here at SEOmoz. Twitter Twitter is a bit of our “catch-all” and has the biggest following. With well over 100k followers, as expected this channel is used for customer service, SEO advice, content promotion and other forms of marketing. What We tweet about SEOmoz content, PRO membership updates, site outages, tool issues, tool upgrades/improvements, YouMoz posts, and anything related to the SEOmoz community. Additionally you’ll see a ton of replies to customer service type inquiries, issues, problems, questions, kudos, high-fives, etc. We keep the tone of the tweets as Mozzy as possible, and speak as if we are Roger. It makes may day when someone tweets to us saying “Hey Roger, thanks for great app” or something along those lines. It’s all about Roger! When Our community is very international, so we can’t just tweet from 9am-5pm Pacific time. We need to be available as often as possible to respond to questions, requests and such. While we do need to sleep at some point, you’ll notice that we have people covering Twitter from about 7am until around 11pm Pacific. Keri helps in the morning since she works from home and can jump right in. Then when I get into the office I take over for the day. She again takes over from about 5-8pm, when I jump back on. We also schedule tweets of our content to go out during “on” hours for many in our community. While we don’t schedule tweets that ask questions and specifically ask for engagement, we do need to schedule them to promote our content. On a side-note our most retweeted tweets usually happen between 2-4am Pacific. Whee! How We use CoTweet to manage Twitter, which allows multiple users to manage multiple accounts. It makes it easy to assign tweets to others plus you can tag tweets and set up extensive searches. I wrote a bit more about it here on Marketing Pilgrim. Who While I’m the main person managing the account, at any time throughout the day you may find Keri, Erica or Casey tweeting as well. I also encourage staff to reply to tweets if the see them and simply cc: @SEOmoz so we know it’s been handled. For example, Rand will often do this. He’ll see a tweet before we do and will respond plus let us know it’s been handled. It’s a great way to give people direct interaction with Mozzers as well! Facebook As I mentioned before, we wanted to figure out a different approach to Facebook so it wasn’t just the same ol’ content as Twitter. So we decided to make Facebook, the “face” of SEOmoz. What Yes, we do post all of our content on Facebook, the same as we do on Twitter but in addition to that we’ll post fun things about the company or publish photos of events. One thing I love to do is get photos from a Meetup or conference and post them to Facebook. We find that by tagging people in photos and having them tag themselves and others, we get a boost in “likes” each time. Additionally, I love to ask questions of the community here. People love to add their opinion and Facebook is a simple and easy way to do it. With so many people logged in all day either on their computers or through their phones or tablets, it’s very easy to get people’s attention on Facebook. We also love to change Roger’s outfit and add some “life” to him. When it comes to comments and wall posts, we manage them just as we would manage comments on our site. If it’s spam we remove it, if it’s obscene or someone cusses, we remove it. Essentially, as long as you’re on-topic and not a jerk, we keep your posts. :) When The timing of Facebook is somewhat similar to Twitter however we don’t schedule Facebook posts. We haven’t quite nailed down a science as to what time is best to post for us yet, but it’s something we’ll probably focus on this year. How Although I could use an outside app to manage Facebook, I choose not to. Facebook seems to not show posts created from outside apps as much in people’s feeds as they do posts directly from Facebook. I want us to show up in those feeds as often as possible. Plus I just like to know I’m seeing what users are seeing on our wall. Who Again, I’m the main person to manage the Facebook page, however Erica, Casey and quite a few others not a part of the official “Community team” others also have admin rights. Google+ As soon as Google+ brand pages came out, we jumped right on it. It has taken us a couple months to shake the bones out and figure out a strategy, but I think we’re going on a nice track now. What In order to not seem like drones showing the exact same content over and over, on our Google+ page we not only promote our own content, but we like to promote other’s as well. This is a great place for us to introduce our readers to hot topics or content on our sites that we think they’d be interested in. However the hottest content we’ve found, is our “Whiteboard+” video series. Essentially, it’s a Whiteboard Friday type of video, but is only posted to Google+. We’ll keep testing this and see what works best, so you might find some new content on there soon as well. J When Right now, since it’s so new we don’t have a specific schedule for posting to Google+. Over this past weekend we posted a special Whiteboard+ video on Friday night at 8pm Pacific and it went crazy! It currently has 353 pluses, 382 shares and 101 comments. And most of this happened over the weekend! I think we may be on to something here… How As far as I know there aren’t any third-party apps out there that let you set up Google+ posts, so I’m logged into Google+ all day long. I’m very happy that they started showing alerts when we get a new follower, comment, plus, etc. It makes it easier to manage than hitting refresh and scanning the page (like I did at first). Who Well since the account right now is connected to my personal account, I’m the only one to manage it. I sincerely hope that they allow the ability to add more users soon. A gal needs a break sometime! LinkedIn Ahh LinkedIn, the stepchild of our social efforts for far too long! Luckily we’re in the middle of building out our strategy, since so many people from the community are there. What As with the other social sites, we’ve set up our RSS feeds from both the Blog and YouMoz to show up on our group page. Additionally we’ll post updates about our tools, webinars coming up and other information the group may be interested in. We also manage people joining the group and as with the other sites, we manage comments and posts the way we manage our own blog. There is daily management on clearing out spam and keeping it clear of sales pitches. We’re also trying new things, like creating a book club and keeping the community connected in other ways. When We usually update LinkedIn during “regular business hours” on the West coast. How LinkedIn actually has some pretty good management features for letting you decline users and keeping out spam. Erica manages all this through LinkedIn directly. Who Erica manages the LinkedIn company page and group. Others on the team have admin access and can jump in at any time. But honestly Erica does such a great job, we haven’t really had to! Whew. Whether you're a member of the Moz community or you manage a community of your own, I hope you've found this insightful and gives you a better understanding of the community management process. Honestly, this just barely touches the surface of what happens behind the scenes. I look forward to getting more in-depth on many of these topics. If you have specific topics you'd like to see covered as it pertains to managing a community, running Social Media sites or even dealing with unruly members, please let me know in the comments. I'd love to cover topics you are interested in. Oh and around here, our motto is \"If all else fails, eat ice cream.\" Copied! Back to Top",
