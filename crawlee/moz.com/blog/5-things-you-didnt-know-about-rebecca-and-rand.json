By: Rebecca Kelley December 15, 2006 5 Things You Didn't Know About Rebecca and Rand Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Rand and I have been tagged by several SEOs to participate in Square Angle's game of blog tag. We thought we'd consolidate our answers in one post to avoid too much noise (hey, it's Friday. Give us a break!):5 Things You Didn't Know About Rebecca: In high school I was voted \"Most Likely to Take Over the World.\" I'll now amend that to be \"Most Likely to Take Over the SEO World.\" Mwuahahahaha!!! Between me and my boyfriend, we own over 800 DVDs. Needless to say, we love movies. It's like I live in a Netflix warehouse. My favorite book is Catch-22. One time I got stuck in my apartment's elevator for over an hour. Thankfully, I was neither going into labor or having to pee. Aaaaaaand, because you're all such a great audience, I'll share the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me: In middle school I inadvertantly (yes, believe it or not, it was an accident) tackled my portly Choir teacher out of his chair in front of the whole class. Picture an adolescent Rebecca slumped over a squat, overweight, middle-aged man in a Cosby sweater, all in a heap on the floor. Yep, that was harsh. Once you have something like that happen to you, you don't embarrass easily. 5 Things You Didn't Know About Rand:OK, I already share way too much, but here I go with a few more... I'm Jewish... well not the religious kind of Jew, but I do my best to call the grandparents on Rosh Hashanah, Passover, Yom Kippur (and if I'm a particuarly good grandson, Sukkot, too). However, I love Christmas, so Mystery Guest and I have a beautiful tree with a Star of David on top (oh so multicultural!) I'm a (humble) master of risotto and have been working on perfecting my own version of the dish (saffron, peas, proscuitto, toasted pine nuts) for several years. I never had much luck with girls until I met Mystery Guest. In fact, the grand total of people I dated before her was 3... including high school. I played intramural football at the Univ. of WA my senior year and was team captain. I played left guard on offense and linebacker on defense; needless to say, we didn't win a single game (but it was still a ton of fun). I'm an insufferable romantic; I love kids, old movies, songs from the '40's, dancing at weddings - all that jazz. Oh yeah, and I've seen pretty much every Simpsons episode ever made a minimum of 4 times. And now that we're through with that meme... I'd like to start another blog tag game (hopefully more relevant one). Any good ideas? Copied! Back to Top",
