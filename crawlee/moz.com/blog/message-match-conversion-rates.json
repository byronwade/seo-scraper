Table of Contents Copied! By: Brad Smith July 13, 2017 How \"Message Match\" Can Lift Conversion Rates by 212.74% [Case Study] Paid Search Marketing (PPC) The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Google offered to build a free mobile website for our past client. But rather than take them up on that very generous offer, they hired us to rebuild it for them (at about $20,000+ times Google’s initial estimate). Smart or dumb? The problem is that shoving an outdated legacy design onto a smaller screen won’t fix your problems. In fact, it’ll only amplify them. Instead, the trick is to zoom back out to the big picture. Then it’s a fairly straightforward process of: Figuring out who your customers are What they want And how they want it That way, you can align all of the critical variables (thereby making your \"messages match\") in order to improve their experience. Which, if done correctly, should also improve your bottom line; in the end, our client saw a 69.39% cost per conversion decrease with a 212.74% conversion rate lift. Here’s how you can do the same. How AdWords pricing works AdWords is an auction. Kinda, sorta. It's an auction-based system where (typically) the highest bidder receives the best positions on the page. But that’s not always the case. It’s possible for someone to rank in the coveted 1–2 positions above you and actually pay less per click than you. (Not to mention convert those people at a higher percentage once they hit your site — but we’ll leave that until later.) Any marketer worth their salt knows what’s coming up next. The Quality Score begins to dictate effective pricing. It’s not the end-all be-all PPC metric. But it’s a helpful gauge that lets you know if you’re on the right path to prosperity and profits — or not. It’s a blend of several factors, including the expected click-through rate, ad relevance, and landing page experience. Ad Rank is used in conjunction to determine position based on an ad’s performance. (That’s the 30-second explanation, anyway.) Years ago, Larry Kim analyzed Quality Score in-depth to determine just what kind of impact it had on what you pay. You should read the full thing. But one of the key takeaways was this: Note that if your Quality Score is below average, you'll basically pay a penalty — up to 64% more per conversion than your average advertiser. In a nutshell, for every Quality Score point above the average 5/10 score, your CPA will drop by 16%, on average. Conversely, for every Quality Score point below the average of 5/10, your CPA will rise by 16%. (Image source) Fast forward to just a few months ago, and Disruptive Advertising’s Jacob Baadsgaard analyzed their 2,000+ AdWords accounts (with millions in ad spend) to filter out a similar analysis. They ended up with strikingly similar results: In fact, our results are strikingly similar to those reported by Larry Kim. If your quality score increases by 1 point, your cost-per-conversion decreases by 13% (Larry puts it at 16%). If your quality score decreases by 1 point, your cost-per-conversion increases by 13%.” (Image source) Coincidence? Unlikely. But wait, there’s more! Jumping platforms for a second, Facebook introduced a \"Relevance Score\" recently. AdEspresso analyzed 104,256 ads over a 45-day period and saw a similar correlation between a higher Relevance Score and lower CPC rates. The inverse is also true. (Image source) Okay. Three different analyses, by three different people, across two channels, with three similar results. What can we learn from this? That the alignment of your ads, your keyword or audience targeting, and your landing pages significantly influence costs (not to mention, eventual results). And what’s the one underlying concept that affects these? Your \"message match.\" How to get message match right Oli from Unbounce is a masochist. You’d have to be anyway, in order to spend a day clicking on 300 different paid ads, noting message match along the way. The final tally? 98% of the 300 ads Oli clicked on did NOT successfully match. That’s incredibly bad, as this doesn’t take any PPC ninja skills. All it takes is a little attention to detail. Because what is message match? You use the same headline, description or value proposition, and image from your ad: (Image source) And include those same elements on the landing page people visit: (Image source) Sure, you probably don’t want to use clip art in your ads and on your landing pages in 2017, but at least they've got the basics down. When you think about this concept holistically, it makes perfect sense. In real life, the majority of communication is nonverbal. Fifty-five percent, in fact, comes down to your expressions, gestures, and posture. Online you lack that nuance and context. It’s difficult (if not impossible) to strike the same emotional chord with a text-only headline limited to 25 characters as you can through audio and video. It (literally) pays to be as specific and explicit as possible. And while it could take hours to distill all of this down, here’s the CliffsNotes version. Step #1: Your audience/keywords AdWords generated about 68% of Google’s revenue in 2014. Last year they made $75 billion. So we’re talking billions with a B here. A lot of that comes down to a searcher’s (1) intent and (2) urgency, where you bid on classically bottom-of-the-funnel keyphrases and convert ~2–10% of those clicks. (Image source) (Facebook’s kind of a different beast, where you instead build a funnel for each step.) Even though it sounds trite, the best ways to come up with keyphrases is a deeper understanding of what makes your potential customers tick (besides doing the obvious and dropping your competitor’s domain name into SEMrush or SpyFu to see what they’re all bidding on). A nice, actionable example of this is The Ad Grid from Digital Marketer, which helps you figure out which potential \"hooks\" should/would work for each customer type. (Image source) From there, you would obviously hit the keyword research market with your Keyword Explorers and SEMrushes and then distill all of your information down into one nice, neat little package. Again borrowing from the excellence of others, my favorite approach would be single-keyword ad group (SKAG) from Johnathan Dane at KlientBoost. For example, one Ad Group would have a single keyphrase with each match type, like the following: Broad: +marriage +proposal +planners Phrase: “marriage proposal planners” Exact: [marriage proposal planners] This, unsurprisingly, seems time-consuming. That’s because it is. Don’t worry, because it’s about to get even worse. Step #2: Your ads The best way to scale your PPC ad writing is to create a formula. You have different variables that you mix-and-match, watching CTRs and other metrics to determine which combination works best. Start with something simple, like Johnathan + Klientboost's example that incorporates the appropriate balance of keyphrase + benefits + action: (Image source) For bottom-of-the-funnel, no-frills keyphrases, sometimes simple and direct works best. You don’t have to get overly clever with reinventing the wheel. You just slap in your keyphrase in that little headline space and try to emphasize your primary value prop, USP, or benefit that might get people to click on your ad instead of all the others that look just like it. Ad writing can get difficult and messy if you get lost in the intangible fluffiness of jargon. Don’t. Instead, focus on emphasizing concrete examples, benefits, and outcomes of whatever it is you’re advertising. Here are some of Digital Marketer's hooks to borrow from: How does it compare the before and after effect? How does it make them feel emotionally/? How (specifically) does it improve their average day? How does it affect their status or vanity? Is there quantifiable proof of results? What’s the expected time to results (i.e. speed)? You can then again strip away the minutia by boiling everything down to variables. For more reading on this topic, here’s a deeper dive into scaling PPC ad writing on WordStream. Step #3: Landing page Okay — here comes the fun part. Marketing efforts in general fail when we can only (or are only allowed) to make surface-level changes. Marketing doesn’t equal just advertising, after all. Made a ton of updates to an AdWords account? Great. You’ll still struggle until you can take full control over the destinations those ads are sending to, and create new dedicated pages for each campaign. In an ideal world, each of your SKAGs created above would have their own specific landing page too. If you’re good at math, that landing page total in your head just jumped another 5X most likely. But as we’ve alluded, it’s worth it. You start with a single new landing page template. Then think of each element as its own interchangeable variable you can mix and match (get it?). For example, the headline, hero image, bullet points and CTAs can evolve or update for one type of customer: And be quickly duplicated/cloned, then switched out for another to increase message match as much as possible: Perfect. Another incredibly time-consuming task to add to your list to get done this week. Fortunately, there are a few tricks to scale this approach too. Possibility #1: Dynamic Text Replacement Unbounce’s ready-made solution will allow you to create a standard landing page, and then automatically (or dynamically) switch out that content based on what someone just searched for. You can enter these dynamic text fields using their visual builder, then hook it up to your AdWords account so you literally don’t have to lift a finger. (Image source) Each section allows you to specify default text to use (similar to how you’d specify a fallback font for all browsers for example). Possibility #2: Advanced Custom Fields This one requires a little bit of extra leg work, but it makes technical people smile. My company used Advanced Custom Fields + Flexible Content to create these variable options on the backend of WordPress pages, so we (and clients) can simply mass-produce unique content at scale. For the example used earlier, here’s what switching out the Hero section on the earlier landing page example would look like: Click and upload an image to a pre-formatted space. Select a few radio options for page placement. Easy-peasy. Here’s what the headline and subhead space looks like: Now making changes or updates to landing pages (to get message match right) takes just a few seconds per page. We even build out these options for secondary calls-to-action on a page as well, like footer CTAs: This way, with the click of a button, we can set up and test how different CTA options might work. For example, how does simple and direct... …compare with one of the hooks that we came up with in a previous step? For extra credit, you can combine these customizable features based on your inbound traffic segmentation with your exit intent (or overlay) messaging. How increasing PPC message match drives results So back to the results. After updating the ad account and making major modifications to our client’s landing page infrastructure, here’s what improved message match can deliver (in a competitive industry with mid-five figure monthly spend). In 2015, before all of this work, the cost per converted click was $482.41 and conversion rate across all accounts was only 4.08%. During the same 30-day period in 2016 (after all of this work), the cost per converted click fell to only $147.65 and the conversion rate jumped to 12.76%. That means way more leads, for far less. And this just scratches the surface, because in many cases, AdWords conversions are still just leads. Not true sales. We haven’t even discussed post-lead conversion tactics to combine all of this with, like marketing automation, where you would combine the same message match approach by sending targeted content that builds on the same topics or hooks that people originally searched for and converted on. Or layering in newer (read: less competitive or expensive) options like Facebook, automatically syncing these leads to your aforementioned marketing automation workflows that are pre-configured with the same message match in mind. The possibilities are endless, and the same laser-focus on aligning message match with each channel has the potential to increase results throughout the entire funnel. Conclusion When a sale is moved from offline to on, we lose a lot of the context for communication that we commonly rely upon. As a result, the focus tends to shift more towards clarity and specificity. There’s no greater example than looking at how today’s most popular online ad platforms work, where the costs people pay are directly tied to their performance and ability to \"match\" or align their ads and content to what people are looking for. Clever vs. clear? Who cares — as long as your messages match. Copied! Back to Top",
