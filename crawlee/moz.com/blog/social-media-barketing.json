By: David Pierce April 1, 2016 Introducing UpDog: Untangling the World of Social Media Barketing Social Media [Estimated read time: 3 minutes] Technology makes it easier than ever to learn about people and the world around you. Despite significant progress, however, the tech community has left a gaping hole unaddressed: the tools available to our dogs to engage in social media marketing are completely unsatisfactory. So, what's UpDog?UpDog is our new company-wide initiative to bring the benefits of human social media marketing to the canine world. If you haven't noticed, we love dogs here at Moz. A photo posted by Moz (@moz_hq) on Aug 26, 2015 at 1:01pm PDTWe're uniquely positioned to hear and empathize with the needs of our aspiring barketers. Now that we have finished our second-quarter planning, we're ecstatic to share that the future is looking up for dogs! We intend to strategically fold canine marketing tools into all of our platforms. Feeling skeptical? Not sure this is right for your social media barketing strategy? Well, check out what Moz's founder has to say: \"Every day, when I walk to work, hop on a plane, or speak at a conference, I see them. Thousands of humans, buried in their phones, swiping for hours through potential dating partners or friends' baby photos or short videos surrounded by crayon scratches. It made me realize — it's not fair that only our species gets this privilege. We need to be thinking about Earth's other inhabitants too, especially our best friends, dogs.\" – Rand Fishkin #InternetOfDogsBefore we can make progress on improving the landscape of marketing tools for dogs, we have to improve the state of content creation itself. That's why we're hereby announcing the Moz Bark-Activated InstaShot Pro tool! We developed this sophisticated technology in-house so we could precisely meet the needs of our furry friends in the office. Each device is uniquely associated with your dog, and connects to WiFi to upload photos to the cloud. Simply bark, upload, and watch the Likes and Hearts roll in for days. Want a taste of the kind of 10x content YOUR dog can start creating without the help of opposable thumbs? Take a look!: Choose from your favorite filters to give your canine perspective that modern human touch! Gratuitous pictures of breakfast, lunch, and dinner have gone to the dogs! Duckface? Welcome to the new obsession to sweep millennial pups — dogface! Seriously, watch out — dogs love selfies. This whole new perspective is sure to draw tons of new followers, likes, and shares! Beautiful design for beautiful dogsThe device itself is sleek and beautiful. Our design team turned to the past to inspire the device of the future. This led us to a design that seamlessly blends with all shapes, sizes, and colors. Moreover, our innovative strategy for collar customization means no dog will have to compromise to match their (probably broodingly artistic) mood on any given day. We'll launch with our original RogerPup model, and are working on partnerships with top designer brands to innovate on iterations of future collars. Looking aheadAs the year progresses, keep your eyes out for improvements, integrations, and renewed focus on shaping our tools for the barketers of the world! Here's what we have in the pipeline for the coming months: Followerwonk – Explore the success of your top Treats on your Twitter account. Compare your main competitors, animalyze trends, and track scents! Click to open a bigger version in a new tab! Moz Local – Understand what drives traffic to your favorite park benches, fire hydrants, and light poles. Be sure your local search barketers know what a zip code is first, though. Moz Content – Support both the analysis and posting of blog posts powered by our top-notch Bark Translation Team. Our newest product will turn over an even newer leaf with cutting-edge bark-to-speech software! The possibilities are as limitless as an off-leash dog park! We're confident this is only the beginning, and we can't wait to see what the future holds as we continue to evolve our business model to meet the avid marketing demands of our furry comrades.
