By: Jane Copland September 3, 2008 New Guide Release: The Professional's Guide to PageRank Optimization Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. As promised last week and earlier today via our Twitter account, we have a new PRO guide to release today. Written by Darren Slatten, The Professional's Guide to PageRank Optimization is a fantastic resource on both the theory and mathematics behind PageRank, and on how SEOs can efficiently practice PageRank sculpting. I was impressed with this guide and think it's an important document. Answering a lot of Q&A, I often read gross misconceptions about how PageRank works. This guide puts many of those misunderstandings to rest. It is also probably our most diagram-heavy guide; the graphics really add to the quality of the article and help explain some of its complexities. Even if you know/understand very little about how real PageRank works (not the green bar in your toolbar which lies, cheats and laughs at you), the guide is both easy to read and to comprehend. After reading this, there is really no excuse for not having a good understanding of PageRank and how to sculpt it for your advantage. PRO members have access to the guide already, but if you'd like to purchase it separately, it's available in the articles section of our SEOmoz store. The individual article's page is here. Happy reading: the 10-question quiz will be administered in a week from today :) Copied! Back to Top",
