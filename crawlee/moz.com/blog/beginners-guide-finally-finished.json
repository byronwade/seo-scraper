By: Rand Fishkin December 5, 2005 Beginner's Guide Finally Finished Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. For the last 4 weeks, I've been toiling away in my non-existant free time on a Beginner's Guide to SEO. My goal was to have a comprehensive document that I could reference to the many newcomers I engage through email, forums and in person. The final product is something I'm already proud of, though I hope to get even more feedback and improve it over time. I've already gotten great advice from my staff (thanks, Kat & Si), some folks at Cre8asite and my good friend, Bill Slawski. This isn't a project I could accomplish single-handedly and my appreciation goes out to the contributors. With a bit of luck, this can be a document that others in the industry can use as a pointer for newbies as well. It's offered in multiple versions - a giant, single page version; a 9-page walkthrough and a printable MS Word version. As always, I'm soliciting your help to make the guide better than it is. There's a thread I've started at Cre8asite with that goal in mind. Tomorrow, I start on a new long-term project for SEOmoz - stay tuned. Copied! Back to Top",
