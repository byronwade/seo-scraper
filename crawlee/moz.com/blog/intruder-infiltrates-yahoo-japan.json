Table of Contents Copied! K By: katfive August 2, 2006 Intruder Infiltrates YaHOO! Japan Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. If this were America, surely security would haul off this man in a heartbeat. But it's not. This is Japan, land of the weird and wacky (I know, did I mention I lived there for 10 months?) and Japanese comedian Razor Ramon merely brushes them aside with a... thrust... of his hips. Razor Ramon plays a character called Hard Gay on a Japanese variety show. In this episode, Hard Gay discovers that Yahoo! has been using his trademark exclamation, \"HOO!\", without his permission. He barges into their offices and demands to be featured in a commercial based on the \"Hoo!\" connection alone. Hilarity ensues. (It should be noted that Hard Gay is just that, a character. He's hilariously flamboyant... and therefore a rather offensive stereotype. But putting all that aside for a moment...) Watch one of his videos for a peek inside Yahoo! Japan. But only if you're not offended by crazy leather-clad hip-pumping comedic freakiness. Copied! Back to Top",
