The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Ok … here is a list that will tell you if you’re a Blogaholic. Just a fun post before we get back to business. So … 21 signs you’re a blogaholic. You’re thinking about naming your kids “Blog” and “Blogriss” At least once, during “intercourse”, you thought about a good blog topic You visit, write and read other blogs on the weekend You’d rather have your car burned than your blog erased with no back up (just imagine this) For some reason you visit your blog 20 times a day You have over 30 blog post drafts waiting to be finished Your spouse has to comment on your blog to get your attention You check your blog stats (Technorati, Feed count, etc) at least 3 times a day. You consider commenting on blogs to be the best and only way of communication. Your kids think that your favorite food, name, TV show, city, country, car, etc is called “Blog” Your relatives and loved ones sign up to MyBlogLog just to be sure you’ll remember their faces Your spouse learned more about you on your blog than she/he knew in the last 20 years You feel like lowering your nation’s flag whenever a blog you like is shutting down You have over 1,300 unread posts in your blog reader AND YOU PLAN TO READ THEM ALL! You own/contribute to more than one blog You’d rather post about your family than be with them at that moment You check your blog every 20 min for new comments (sometimes you're even happy to see those SPAM comments) You leave comments on your own blog when you feel lonely. Worst case … you even start to argue You write at least 5 posts per day and you feel they all deserve a first page on Digg You keep a notepad and a pen handy in case you think of a good blog post You show a video of your marriage proposal on your blog. (hint, hint) (BONUS). You read every word of this post. Don’t let this get you down. Now go back to spaming on MyBlogLog and Digging your own posts. Copied! Back to Top",
