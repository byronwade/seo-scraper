Table of Contents Copied! By: Rebecca Kelley September 19, 2006 What's the ROI on an MBA When You're in the SEO Industry? Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Although I've had my Bachelor's degree for less than a year, I've already begun considering going back to school for a Master's degree. Working in the SEO industry has sparked an interest in getting an MBA (a Master's in Business Administration for you initialism-inept readers). My desire to get an MBA doesn't stem from the notion that more degrees = better pay (though it does); rather, in this instance I feel that the knowledge I'd gain from such a degree would be a great benefit to the continuing success and growth of SEOmoz.With that in mind, I attended an MBA information session at the University of Washington (my alma mater). I was immediately gung-ho about the Technology Management MBA Program. It's an 18-month long program and flexible for full-time professionals, plus it seems like it would give me the most applicable experience (given the industry I'm in). Then I saw the cost of the program. $52,800. Holy. Crap. Mind you, this cost covers tuition, textbooks, class materials, registration, parking, and even meals, but nonetheless...that's friggin' spendy. My next alternative, the Evening MBA Program, is considerably cheaper at $13,410/year, but it's for a 3-year program. A program that's cheaper but twice as long and meets twice as often vs. one that's shorter but pricier? How does a girl choose?Which led me to thinking...what is the ROI of pursuing an MBA when you work in the SEO industry? I'd thought I'd open the forum to any and all SEO professionals out there who can give me some input. Would pumping loads of money into a Master's degree be a huge benefit to me and to SEOmoz? Or do I work in an industry where the most successful experience is hands-on learning and time spent in the industry? Does Rand need to give me a whopping raise so that I can afford to go to school again? Would investing in my education pay off? Copied! Back to Top",
