By: Rand Fishkin September 8, 2005 The Importance of an About Page Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Kim's got a terrific thread going at Cre8asite on the importance of \"about us\" or \"about me\" pages. She starts by pointing to Andy Beal's new about page (although, if I remember correctly, it's remarkably similiar to his old one) on his brand new blog. She writes: For usability, an About Us page is a workhorse in my opinion. When I test sites, I've noticed that the kind of introductory content I'm hoping to find on the homepage, such as the what/where/how/why/when details, is hiding quietly in the About Us page. While I'm happy to find this information, it's a click away from the homepage, where its most needed to make a quick impression. And she ends with: We like to think the Internet has brought us all a little bit closer to each other, but the truth is, we're still seeking ways with our writing and design skills to make profitable or friendly connections. An About Us/Me page, when presented with humor, honesty and true facts, can bring you one step closer to letting someone shake your hand. I've tried my hand at my own about page - it's relatively personal, but I wonder if it provides the right kind of information... I guess the first question I need to answer is, \"what do I want people to know about me?\", followed immediately by \"what do people want to know about me?\" If you've got advice, I'm ready to make changes.
