By: Rand Fishkin January 5, 2012 Interim Linkscape Update for January Moz Tools The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. If you've been following my posts on Linkscape's index, you know that we've been trying to aim for fresher, better and larger indices over the past few months, but have been finding some very tough challenges. It turns out that indexing the web, canonicalizing millions of pages and calculating a link graph with quality metrics is super-hard; who knew? :-) As part of those efforts, we've been working toward an experimental index that leverages a more search-engine style crawler that crawls fresher pages/sites more often and less fresh stuff less frequently. That index, however, is taking its sweet time (and we're doing a lot of babysitting and monitoring to make sure it's smooth). Our tentative plan is to have that index launched in the next 2 weeks, but we felt that since our last index was at the very end of November, a new one with fresher data was warranted. Hence, last night, we launched an interim index with the following metrics: 36,660,519,013 (36 billion) URLs 427,626,242 (427 million) Subdomains 128,149,029 (128 million) Root Domains 387,656,119,262 (387 billion) Links Followed vs. Nofollowed 2.05% of all links found were nofollowed 55.00% of nofollowed links are internal, 45.00% are external Rel Canonical - 10.57% of all pages now employ a rel=canonical tag The average page has 69.12 links on it (negligible from last index) 57.76 internal links on average 11.36 external links on average This index is smalller than our last few, but the numbers look reasonably solid and the data's from the first few weeks of December, so it should be helpful to all you link builders and analyzers. Do be aware, though, that this update is likely to only last a couple weeks before we replace it with our new version, for which we have high expectations (but don't want to promise the moon just yet). Also noteworthy - last night, when the index first launched, we experienced some wackiness with Page and Domain Authority scores. Those should have largely settled down to normalcy now, but if you see anything odd, please let us know. Copied! Back to Top",
