G By: GeoffreyF67 September 6, 2006 Variation on Type-In Traffic SEO Analytics The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I recently had the opportunity to renew 1000 of my spam domains.Since the domains only cost me 99 cents each when I bought them and renewal was nearly $6 at the time, I decided it wasn't worth it.In fact, my evil plan was that I was going to simply let these sites expire and then buy them back once they expired and went into the domain pool...Imagine my surprise, then, when RegisterFly started snatching up the domains:Domain ID:D10433389-LRMSDomain Name:THEOFFICIALSCOOP1.INFOCreated On:17-Jun-2005 19:01:42 UTCLast Updated On:18-Jun-2006 15:17:44 UTCExpiration Date:17-Jun-2007 19:01:42 UTCSponsoring Registrar:eNom, Inc. (R126-LRMS)Status:OKRegistrant ID:C635403-LRMSRegistrant Name:Domain RegistrationRegistrant Organization:Registerfly.comRegistrant Street1:623 Eagle Rock AvenueNow, the interesting thing to note is that they didn't snatch all of the domains I let drop, but they did do the ones that were getting traffic.To make it even more interesting, RegisterFly put up a domain parking page.So, pick whatever registrar you like so much and here's what they're most likely doing... Register domains in quantity for folks. Wait for those domains to expire. When they expire, the domain registrar has a certain period of time (45 days?) to keep the domain in case the person who owned it wants to renew. In that time frame, they've got plenty of time to test a domain parking page and see if it generates revenue, and... If it does generate 99 cents or more revenue in that 45 days, they've got a winner on their hands and will register it themselves. I don't know about you, but that looks like a cash cow business model to me when you can get customers to register domains and build traffic to them FOR you!The only thing I haven't been able to work out yet is how they're tracking the amount of money they make on the clicks by domain.I'm not sure what the search engines do (if anything) to combat this.G-ManEdit: renew domains not subodmains :P Copied!
