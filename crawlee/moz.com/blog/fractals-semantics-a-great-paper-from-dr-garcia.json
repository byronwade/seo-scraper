By: Rand Fishkin April 29, 2005 Fractals & Semantics - A Great Paper from Dr. Garcia Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Dr. Garcia, known on the forums as Orion, has written what will surely become one of the most linked to documents in the SEO world over the next few days. The article - Fractals, L-Systems and Semantics - explains how and why the structures of sentences and therefore documents can be reduced to their fractal nature via analysis. This \"fractal nature\" would help to confirm many SEO's suspicions about the ability of search engines in the future to use greater on-page analysis techniques to rank documents. The search engines' implementation of fractal text analysis could help to further eliminate spam and auto-generated content form the SERPs, as well as give higher rankings to exceptional or particularly relevant content (as opposed to the current heavy reliance on link data). Orion has opened a thread at SEW to discuss the paper. Copied! Back to Top",
