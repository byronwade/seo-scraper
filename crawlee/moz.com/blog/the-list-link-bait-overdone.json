S By: Sujan Sarkar July 31, 2008 List Link Bait = Overdone Social Media This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Blogs are a good way to set up some fine quality link baits (mind you, link baiting is good thing). Write something great about (or at least related to) what you're selling and if it's good, you'll find all kinds of people linking to ya...or even digging you on Digg, stumbling you StumbleUpon, or \"whateva they do\" on del.ico.us. But I've recently seen that people who can't write a great article (I mean can't write a great article at that moment in time--some of them really put some great articles up.) go ahead and make a list of all those related articles, like \"30 Best Jquery Tuts,\" \"57 Great Photoshop Resources,\" and so on. I would like to say here that some of them are really great, like the ones on Smashing Magazine. But then I have seen some lesser-known bloggers churning out lists like \"Best SEO Tools\" and having 2 or 3 links to really ridiculous sites with some rudimentary tools (I believe they put links to such tools so that they aren't filtered out as duplicates). But what's the point? Your so-so \"unique\" post lacks quality, so no one diggs it except you. That ain't getting you very far. TO ALL THOSE NOVICE LIST MAKERS: For any blog or article, you need to keep in mind things that would give value to your reader. Uniquely make the list longer/shorter, or add your precious comments to each item on the list. And if you can't get down to making a great list, find something to whine about...wait a minute...oops! Last, but not least, I didn't mean to offend any of you guys who often come out with those great lists. I've dugg some of you on Digg (my profile). I also might put up some lists soon, like \"My 10 Fav FF addons,\" \"Why I Luv Digg,\" \"10 People I'd Love to Meet,\" \"Top 10 People I Would Like to Kill\" [note to self: do not disclose the existence of such a list in public; they make you look like a Psycho]... ;) Copied!
