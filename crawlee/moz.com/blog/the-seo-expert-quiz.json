J By: Jeff Pollard September 10, 2007 Are You a Newbie, a Novice, a Master or a Dark Lord of SEO - Take our Quiz & Find Out Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. So, you think you know your SEO inside and out, eh? Well, now's your chance to show your stuff. SEOmoz is proud to announce the SEO Expert Quiz. 75 action-packed questions designed to test your mettle, covering all corners of the SEO universe from beginner knowledge to sneaky tricks only true Dark Lords of the SERPs will know. Once completed, you'll have the chance to share in your triumph (or tragedy) by slapping your SEOmoz SEO Quiz badge on your site to let the world know how hard you rock the SEO game. SEOmoz SEO Expert Quiz UPDATE from Rand: Just a warning to folks - this is a tough quiz, and it's a bit time consuming. However, I do think there's a lot of good knowledge to be gained from taking it, and even if you disagree with some of the answers, that debate alone should add to the value of the quiz. Jeff & Scott both put a ton of work into this, and I'm really proud of the results. Great work to both of them. p.s. There's 271 points available because the questions are weighted - easy questions aren't worth as much as hard questions. And yes, Rebecca only scored a 4.. :) Copied! Back to Top",
