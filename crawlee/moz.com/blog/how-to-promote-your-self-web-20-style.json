O By: Oliver Bayes-Shelton February 10, 2009 How to Promote Yourself, Web 2.0 Style Social Media This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. As we all know, there are a lot of so-called SEO experts sending out emails telling you that they guarantee page 1 ranking but then ask for your link. I don't agree with that strategy; instead, I think that taking these 7 steps will help get your name out there and connect with the people within our industry and make you look like a real SEO expert. Write down on a piece of paper your overall life goal with regards to work. Decide what you are going to do to make this goal an achievement. For us marketers I feel it is SEO, SMO and blogging. Once you have made your decision on what your expertise is, you need to buy a domain relevant to you and also your own name. For example, I bought www.seoandsmo.com and www.obayesshelton.com. This tells the user that the site is about SEO and SMO and also who they are reading about. Once you have your domain, you need to get a blog up and running, too. Not only will a blog help your site start to pick traffic, it tells the reader you know what you are talking about. If you're an Internet marketer, try and keep your blog focused on SEO and SMO related articles (like how you would on YOUmoz). Make your website a place of worship for yourself--write about yourself, your portfolio, contact details, and customer reviews. Once you have worked on your own domain and blog, start on some social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, SEOmoz, Flickr, YouTube, etc. The things you need to remember is that you should never have a profile picture featuring you holding a vodka bottle or sticking your rear out. You need to make sure your profiles all link together (if possible). Also, add social networking badges to your blog and website if you can. Make sure you have a professional email address set up for contacting people. Use your domain to set up email addresses to Sales, your name, Admin, and Info@yourdomain.com. Make sure all your email signatures and social networking contact details are all up to date and correct. Finally, make your resume. Mashable has a great article on building the ultimate social media resume. I don't want you to think that SEOmoz readers don't know how to do this--I just wanted to share some of my ideas. I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback in the comments! Copied! Back to Top",
