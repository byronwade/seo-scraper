By: Rand Fishkin August 19, 2005 Link Analysis Tool from SEOBook Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Aaron Wall has put together a very impressive link analysis tool. Sadly, I don't have time to check it out personally, as I'm deep in tool building myself. However, his review of the tool is exceptional and walks through every aspect of what is being analyzed and retrieved. This tool is Windows based and downloadable, rather than web-based due to API query concerns (which I'm very familiar with). Great work, Aaron. You've raised the bar on free tools, and I'll have to reciprocate when I can. Copied! Back to Top",
