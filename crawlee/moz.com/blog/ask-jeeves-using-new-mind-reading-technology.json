Mobile SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Last Saturday night I fell asleep on a friend's couch after watching a really funny television program. I couldn't remember the name until yesterday, when a visitor to our offices mentioned it - My Name is Earl. I'm not typically much of an Ask user, but I figured I'd go over to their site this morning and see what time it's normally on... that's when things got spooky. First off, the small text below the butler titled \"Search with Keywords or Questions\" had the link \"My Name is Earl\"... I literally looked around to see if Rahul Lahiri (one of Ask's search engineers) was playing a practical joke on me. Then, by clicking the link, Ask gave me this great snippet telling me what time it aired and on what network - very impressive. Asks' results in general may not always be strong, but secret mind-reading powers is something the SEs have been working on for a long time. Let's see if lightning strikes twice - next Friday, I'll make sure to visit again. Copied! Back to Top",
