By: Rand Fishkin October 7, 2010 SEOmoz Meetups Coming to New York, Sofia, Las Vegas, Dublin, San Diego and More SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. You've probably already noticed that here at SEOmoz, we tend to travel quite a bit. Often times we're speaking at a conference or covering it on the blog, but sometimes we find ourselves wishing we had more time to hang out with the community. We needed to come up with a way to spend some quality time with you. So, we're sending mozzers out to cities all over the world to have Meetups and give us a chance to get to know you in a more intimate setting. We're interested in learning first-hand what we can we do to make our software work harder for you, if you'd like to learn about a specific subject on the blog and in general, anything you'd like to tell us! Of course, we'll provide the beer, probably some food and at the very least some interesting conversation. Upcoming Meetups New York City - Oct. 19, 6-9pm Eastern New York City is probably the best place we could think of to have our first SEOmoz meetup. Promediacorp has been gracious enough to let us use their amazing office to host the event. This should be a really great event as we'll have a few speakers in addition to food and drink. We are limiting the event to 50 people, so if you can definitely join us, please be sure to RSVP! NYC Speakers: Rand Fishkin, CEO, SEOmoz Topic: Shhhh.... A sneak peek at new research from SEOmoz Chris Winfield, CMO & Managing Partner, BlueGlass Topic: Major Trends in SEO as seen from the team at BlueGlass Greg Gortz, VP Sales, Zemanta Topic: Link Building Best Practices for 2010 and beyond Sofia, Bulgaria - Oct. 29, 7-9pm We're still waiting to finish the final touches on this event. Be sure to follow us on Twitter or keep an eye on our events page and we'll announce changes as they come up. I'll be speaking at the Webit Expo on Friday, October 29th, and we're planning to host a pub meetup that evening somewhere nearby. Las Vegas - Nov. 10, 5:30-7:30pm Pacific For the past few years we've held our annual Search Spam Party. This year at PubCon we'll be hosting a happy hour with free drinks and light appetizers for all PubCon attendees. We're still looking to finalize the exact location but we're planning on having it at or near the Wynn. So after the last session of the day head on over for a fun, relaxing happy hour with all your favorite peeps. Don't miss it! As PubCon gets closer we'll have more information about the location and a place to sign up. San Diego - December We'll have more information about this one soon. The event should take place around December 20th. But what about my city? Don't worry! We are planning more SEOmoz events. You can stay up-to-date on the location of the moz team on this new fancy looking page. This calendar not only shows our meetups but also shows what conferences we'll be speaking at and who's speaking and/or attending. It will be updated often, so if you're ever curious where we are and what we're up to, you can find out here. Copied! Back to Top",
