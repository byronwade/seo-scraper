By: Rebecca Kelley July 25, 2007 I Got Naked With Michael Arrington... SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. ...and John Cook from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Tricia Duryee from the Seattle Times, Fred Vogelstein from Wired Magazine, and Becky Buckman from the Wall Street Journal. Quite the title and intro, huh? Let me elaborate. Last night I attended a seminar at The Havana Social Club called \"The Naked Truth.\" It was put on by Redfin, the Madrona Venture Group, Farecast, iLike, Jobster, Wetpaint, and WildTangent. The purpose of the seminar was to discuss ways to get your stories into newspapers, blogs, and other high-profile publications. It was a concise hour-long discussion, and there was a party afterwards that provided drinks and barbecue (which I did not partake in due to the fact that it's hard to eat ribs when you only have one functioning thumb). I'll share some of the most interesting questions and responses below: Q: What are some ways entrepreneurs can approach journalists? What works and what doesn't? Michael: The best way to get a positive mention on TechCrunch is to have a really cool product. You can be a stupid, unlikeable CEO who can still get your company mentioned if your product or service is really cool. Also, get rid of boring, traditional marketing pitches--we've heard them all. Becky: Requests via email are typically better because they're much more manageable. Phone calls will work if we know who you are. You also need to decide if you want blog or newspaper attention, because the two can be quite different. Also, we're only as smart as the people we talk to. We like being told trends. Economic issues are especially interesting themes. Fred: There's not much of a difference in what I'm looking for vs. what Becky or Michael are looking for. We basically want to be in touch with connected people who know what's going on and are aware of upcoming trends/what's hot today. Q: How can a company get mentioned in both Seattle newspapers? John: We realize that it's a two newspaper town, so we understand if there's some overlap with news. Tricia: You should think about what's better for your business. If you just want publicity, you can try and approach both newspapers; however, if you want a piece that's specific about your business and gets to know you, it may be better to get only one newspaper to cover your story. Q: What do you think of PR firms? Should an entrepreneur hire them or just do the work himself? Michael: Some are okay, but a lot lie and manipulate to get what they want. I don't really care about getting the \"exclusive\", the breaking story. I only ask that PR firms play it straight--don't tell me the same thing you're turning around and telling the Wall Street Journal. Fred: They're useful if they're used sparingly. There are a handful of good PR firms out there. Lots are well-connected, so I'd recommend trying to find one of those firms. Don't get a PR firm just to lessen your workload, because they can end up sucking a lot of money out of your budget. Becky: PR firms can suck the life/passion out of you. We like writing about passionate people, and PR companies can steal some of that from you. Q: What's a good story angle to get you interested in writing about someone/something? John: Anything with a news hook, such as a financing event, which is typically a transformative event in a company's history. Tricia: Trend pieces. Michael: Any story that can be spiced up with a unique fact, such as a company with a very young founder, a company whose founder is from a country with few startups, etc. Fred: Tell me about the world you live in. If you help me, I'll help you. Michael (to Fred): That's bullshit. These people want to know how to get written about, and you're telling them \"It's good if you're a source for me.\" Fred: Well, I work for mainstream media! I'm a bit of a dinosaur. Question: What are some tips for the actual interview process? John: Don't lie! Just be straight if you can't answer a question. I've been a journalist for ten years, and I've caught people lying a lot. Tricia: If you can't answer a question, try to redirect it onto other facts. Say something like \"I can't tell you, but I can say this...\" Michael: Try not to waste time. A five minute conversation can be more valuable than an hour-long conversation. Becky: I am under the assumption that everything is on the record, so be sure that everyone's aware of ground rules before starting the interview. We don't generally check quotes after the interview before publishing. We ask that you trust us not to take something out of context--we're the professionals; we can be trusted. Michael: I've never broken a \"Please don't print that\" request. It usually builds a good relationship because I know I have them by the balls. Q: Are you worried about exacerbating negative trends by reporting on them? For example, Pay Per Post? Michael: I write about interesting stories. I'm not interested in 3rd party effects. My goal is to make a ton of money and retire as young as I can, so I'm not worried about the repercussions of covering negative trends. Q: What do you think about entrepreneur blogs? Michael: I think they're really important. You should have a company and/or a personal blog--it's what makes you interesting. It gives you a voice. My crappy photo of the panel: John Cook, Tricia Duryee, Michael Arrington, Fred Vogelstein, and Becky Buckman Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the seminar. It was short but engaging. The panelists were all interesting and passionate people, and they weren't afraid to disagree with one another. I would love to attend quick seminars like this one again in the future, and I think that The Naked Truth was a good start. Copied! Back to Top",
