M By: mozUser1469147917838 January 6, 2006 Google experiments mixing country specific and global results together Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. A recent topic in SC brought up an interesting update with Google: they are adding country specific results to global results. And even interesting is the way they do it - instead of doing a wide scale mixture, they seem to take only #1 from country specific search and place it somewhere in top30 of global search. Take for example search phrase XHTML. When I search for XHTML in google.fi (finnish language option selected), there is our XHTML-series (in finnish) as #1. When I do a global search (no language option selected), there we are placed on 4th position right below W3C and other big names. This is new and welcome addition to Google search. Personally I have very little to complain with this experiment, but I would sure love to get options to a) wipe out localised results if wanted, b) and get a more versatile selection of localised results in top30. Interesting note is that the mixture seems to be related to keyword competiviness. So far I have found this mixture occurring only for minor to medium competed keywords, but if I look something highly competed (like \"seo\" or \"web design\") the results are still the same old without any country specific results. As always, feel free to share your comments and notes. Copied! Back to Top",
