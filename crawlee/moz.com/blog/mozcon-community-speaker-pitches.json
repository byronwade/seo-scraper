By: Cheryl Draper Edited By: Emilie Martin January 29, 2024 It’s Your Time to Shine — MozCon Community Speaker Application Form is Open! SEO Events | Moz News MozCon is bringing the Future of Digital Marketing to Seattle this June 3 & 4, and we’re excited to announce the return of our annual call for up-and-coming community speakers to pitch! Every year, we take great pride in reserving space on our stage exclusively for new voices. Are you the person that everyone in your network looks to for digital marketing advice? Perhaps you’ve been honing your voice on podcasts, at meetups, or blogs, all the while dreaming of stepping onto the big stage to share your innovative ideas? Now’s your chance to submit your pitch for the opportunity to join industry leaders on the MozCon stage in front of 1,500 of your peers. (No pressure!) Not sure what a community speaker is? At MozCon, we have a speaker selection committee that identifies practitioners at the top of their professional field with a mean speaking game. But these spots are by invite only, and we know the community is bursting at the seams with hidden gems ready to share groundbreaking research, hot tips, and SEO tests that drive results. Cue our MozCon community speaker program! We’ve reserved two 15-minute community speaker slots throughout our conference for fresh faces to shine on the big stage. We encourage anyone in the SEO community to submit their best and most exciting presentation ideas for a chance to be selected as a community speaker at MozCon. Not only are these sessions incredibly well-received by our attendees, but they’re also a fantastic way to get your foot in the door when it comes to the SEO speaking circuit. Interested in pitching your own idea? Read on for everything you need to know: How to submit To submit a pitch, fill out the community speaker submission form. Only submit one talk! We want the one you’re most passionate about. Talks must be related to digital marketing and be a topic you can cover in 15 minutes. [Pro tip: Keep it actionable, and be sure to include a few key learning outcomes the audience will come away with from your session in the pitch.] Submissions close on Wednesday, February 14, 2024, at 5 pm PT — no exceptions! If chosen, you’ll be required to present your talk in person at MozCon in Seattle, WA, on June 3 & 4, 2024. Incomplete submissions will not be considered, and all decisions are final. All speakers must adhere to the MozCon Code of Conduct. Submit my pitch! Our internal team reviews all submissions and will reach out to you if your pitch is accepted. We’ll work hard to make our decisions as quickly as we can, but please note that due to the volume of submissions we typically receive, we’re unable to provide specific feedback on individual applications. What do speakers receive? As a community speaker, you will receive: 15 minutes on the MozCon stage for a keynote-style presentationA free ticket to MozCon (we can issue a refund or transfer if you’ve already purchased yours)Travel and accommodations during MozConSupport and feedback as you build your final presentation deck to make sure you deliver the talk of your life on our stage. And a few more surprises… How we select our speakers We have an internal committee of experienced Moz team members, seasoned speakers, and subject matter experts who review every pitch. We analyze each topic to make sure there’s no overlap and to confirm that it’s a good fit for our audience and conference focus. Next, we look at the entirety of the pitch to help us get a comprehensive idea of what to expect from your talk on the MozCon stage and how it might be received by the audience. This is where links to previous decks, content, and videos of past presentations are helpful (but aren’t required). Here’s how to make your pitch stand out: Keep your pitch focused on digital marketing. SEO topics are great, but we also love topics that complement or sit adjacent to SEO. The more actionable the pitch, the better.Be focused and concise. What value does your talk provide? We want to hear the actual takeaways our audience will learn about and why it’s important — not just a vague reference to them. Remember, we receive a ton of pitches, so the more clearly you can explain the tactical steps and learning objectives for the audience, the better you’ll stand out. Do your research! Review the topics presented at past MozCons, on the Moz Blog, and in our Whiteboard Friday videos for a sense of what resonates with our audience — we’re looking for fresh, new presentations that round out our agenda to add to the stage. Brush up on how to prepare for speaking. No pitches will be evaluated in advance, so please don’t ask :) Using social media to lobby your pitch won’t help. Instead, put your time and energy into the actual pitch itself!Linking to a previous example of a slide deck or presentation isn’t required, but it does help the committee get a fuller picture of your unique presentation style. Leading up to MozCon If your pitch is selected, the MozCon team is here to support you along the way. It’s our goal to make sure this is your best talk to date, whether it’s your first time under those bright stage lights or you’re a seasoned speaker who feels perfectly at home in front of a big crowd.
