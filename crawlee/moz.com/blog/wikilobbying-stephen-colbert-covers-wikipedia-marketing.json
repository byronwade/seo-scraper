Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin January 30, 2007 WikiLobbying - Stephen Colbert Covers Wikipedia Marketing Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I don't really need to say anything here - Colbert's covered it all: The video embed system doesn't work so click here to watch it. This is clearly a program that \"gets it.\" The lines in this piece are almost too good to be true, including: Wikipedia - The encyclopedia where you can be an authority, even if you don't know what the hell you're talking about. and When Wikipedia becomes our most trusted reference source, reality is just what the majority agrees upon. and, last but not least, When money determines Wikipedia entries, reality has become a commodity. It's hard not to laugh, not just because he hits the issues square in the jaw, but because so many folks that play in the SEO sphere do accept payment for what amounts to \"Wikilobbying.\" Thanks for the word, Mr. Colbert, we promise to use it as best we can.
