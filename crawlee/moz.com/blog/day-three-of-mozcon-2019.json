Table of Contents Copied! By: Kameron Jenkins July 17, 2019 MozCon 2019: Everything You Need to Know About Day Three Moz News | SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. If the last day of MozCon felt like it went too fast or if you forgot everything that happened today (we wouldn't judge — there were so many insights), don't fret. We captured all of day three's takeaways so you could relive the magic of day three. Don't forget to check out all the photos with Roger from the photobooth! They're available here in the MozCon Facebook group. Plus: You asked and we delivered: the 2019 MozCon speaker walk-on playlist is now live and available here for your streaming pleasure. Cindy Krum— Fraggles, Mobile-First Indexing, & the SERP of the Future If you were hit with an instant wave of nostalgia after hearing Cindy's walk out music, then you are in good company and you probably were not disappointed in the slightest by Cindy’s talk on Fraggles. First learning of the day: Fraggles. Fragment + Handles. A piece of information and an anchor that scrolls directly to the information on the page @Suzzicks #MozCon— Warrior Forum (@warriorforum) July 17, 2019 “Fraggles” are fragments + handles. A fragment is a piece of info on a page. A handle is something like a bookmark, jump link, or named anchor — they help people navigate through long pages to get what they’re looking for faster. Ranking pages is an inefficient way to answer questions. One page can answer innumerable questions, so Google’s now can pull a single answer from multiple parts of your page, skipping sections they don’t think are as useful for a particular answer.The implications for voice are huge! It means you don’t have to listen to your voice device spout off a page’s worth of text before your question is answered. Google wants to index more than just websites. They want to organize the world’s information, not websites. Fraggles are a demonstration of that. Luke Carthy — Killer Ecommerce CRO and UX Wins Using A SEO Crawler Luke Carthy did warn us in his talk description that we should all flex our notetaking muscles for all the takeaways we would furiously jot down — and he wasn’t wrong. “Traffic doesn’t always mean sales, and sales doesn’t always mean traffic.” @MrLukeCarthy #MozCon— Melina Beeston (@mkbeesto) July 17, 2019 Traffic doesn’t always mean sales and sales don’t always mean traffic!Custom extraction is a great tool for finding missed CRO opportunities. For example, Luke found huge opportunity on Best Buy’s website — thousands of people’s site searches were leading them to an unoptimized “no results found” page. You can also use custom extraction to find what product recommendations you or your customers are using at scale! Did you know that 35% of what customers buy on Amazon and 75 percent of what people watch on Netflix are the results of these recommendations?For example, are you showing near-exact products or are you showing complementary products? (hint: try the latter and you’ll likely increase your sales!)Custom extraction from Screaming Frog allows you to scrape any data from the HTML of the web pages while crawling them. Andy Crestodina — Content, Rankings, and Lead Generation: A Breakdown of the 1% Content Strategy Next up, Andy of Orbit Media took the stage with a comprehensive breakdown of the most effective tactics for turning content into a high-powered content strategy. He also brought the fire with this sound advice that we can apply in both our work life and personal life. If you write an amazing, high-traffic blog post, the people visiting it don't have commercial intent. People landing on a sales page have 50x higher intent. #mozcon @crestodina— Mike Arnesen (@Mike_Arnesen) July 17, 2019 Blog visitors often don’t have commercial intent. One of the greatest ways to leverage blog posts for leads is by using the equity we generate from links to our helpful posts and passing that onto our product and service pages. If you want links and shares, invest in original research! Not sure what to research? Look for unanswered questions or unproven statements in your industry and provide the data. Original research may take longer than a standard post, but it’s much more effective! When you think about it this way, do you really have time to put out more, mediocre posts?Give what you want to get. Want links? Link to people. Want comments? Comment on others people's work. To optimize content for social engagement, it should feature real people, their faces, and their quotes.Collaborating with other content creators on your content not only gives it built-in amplification, but it also leads to great connections and is just generally more fun. Rob Ousbey — Running Your Own SEO Tests: Why It Matters & How to Do It Right Google’s algorithms have changed a heck of a lot in recent years — what’s an SEO to do? Follow Rob’s advice — both fashion and SEO — who says that the answer lies in testing. in head terms, it's about user engagement metrics. However, links are more correllated with long tail searches. @RobOusbey #Mozcon— Matthew Decuir (@MattBasically) July 17, 2019 “This is the way we’ve always done it” isn’t sufficient justification for SEO tactics in today’s search landscape.In the earlier days of the algorithm, it was much easier to demote spam than it was to promote what’s truly good. Rob and his team had a theory that Google was beginning to rely more heavily on user experience and satisfaction than some of the more traditional ranking factors like links. Through SEO A/B testing, they found that:Google relies less heavily on link signals when it comes to the top half of the results on page 1.Google relies more heavily on user experience for head terms (terms with high search volume), likely because they have more user data to draw from.In the process of A/B testing, they also found that the same test often produces different results on different sites. The best way to succeed in today’s SEO landscape is to cultivate a culture of testing! Greg Gifford — Dark Helmet's Guide to Local Domination with Google Posts and Q&A If you’re a movie buff, you probably really appreciated Greg’s talk — he schooled us all in movie references and brought the fire with his insights on Google Posts and Q&A Google Posts allows you to drive conversions without driving people to your site - convert on zero-click searches! @GregGifford #MozCon— Ruth Burr Reedy (@ruthburr) July 17, 2019 The man behind #shoesofmozcon taught us that Google is the new home page for local businesses, so we should be leveraging the tools Google has given us to make our Google My Business profiles great. For example… Google Posts Images should be 1200x900 on google postsImages are cropped slightly higher than the center and it’s not consistent every timeThe image size of the thumbnail is different on desktop than it is on mobileUse Greg’s free tool at bit.ly/posts-image-guide to make sizing your Google Post images easierYou can also upload videos. The file size limit is 100mb and/or 30 secondsAdd a call-to-action button to make your Posts worth it! Just know that the button often means you get less real estate for text in your Posts Don’t share social fluff. Attract with an offer that makes you stand outMake sure you use UTM tracking so you can understand how your Posts are performing in Google Analytics. Otherwise, it’ll be attributed as direct traffic. Google Q&A Anyone can ask and answer questions — why not the business owner! Control the conversation and treat this feature like it's your new FAQ page. This feature works on an upvote system. The answer with the most upvotes will show first. Don’t include a URL or phone number in these because it’ll get filtered out. A lot of these questions are potential customers! Out of 640 car dealerships’ Q&As Greg evaluated, 40 percent were leads! Of that 40 percent, only 2 questions were answered by the dealership. Emily Triplett Lentz — How to Audit for Inclusive Content Emily of Help Scout walked dropped major knowledge on the importance of spotting and eliminating biases that frequently find their way into online copy. She also hung out backstage after her talk to cheer on her fellow speakers. #GOAT. #notallheroeswearcapes. \"My desire for a specific word choice doesn't negate someone else's need for safety\" -- @emilytlentz #MozCon pic.twitter.com/sXF2CjXVzo— Yosef Silver (@ysilver) July 17, 2019 As content creators, we’d all do well to keep ableism in mind: discrimination in favor of able-bodied people. However, we’re often guilty of this without even knowing it. One example of ableism that often makes its way into our copy is comparing dire or subideal situations with the physical state of another human (ex: “crippling”). While we should work on making our casual conversation more inclusive too, this is particularly important for brands.Create a list of ableist words, crawl your site for them, and then replace them. However, you’ll likely find that there is no one-size-fits-all replacement for these words. We often use words like “crazy” as filler words. By removing or replacing with a more appropriate word, we make our content better and more descriptive in the process. At the end of the day, brands should remember that their desire for freedom of word choice isn’t more important than people’s right not to feel excluded and hurt. When there’s really no downside to more inclusive content, why wouldn’t we do it? Visit http://content.helpscout.net/mozcon-2019 to learn how to audit your site for inclusive content! Joelle Irvine — Image & Visual Search Optimization Opportunities Curious about image optimization and visual search? Joelle has the goods for you — and was blowing people's minds with her tips for visual optimization and how to leverage Google Lens, Pinterest, and AR for visual search. “Visual search is easier when you don’t know what you’re looking for, when you’re looking to match a particular style, and when your search way is too long or complicated.” @joelleirvine #MozCon— Melina Beeston (@mkbeesto) July 17, 2019 Visual search is not the same thing as searching for images. We’re talking about the process of using an image to search for other content. Visual search like Google Lens makes it easier to search when you don’t know what you’re looking for.Pinterest has made a lot of progress in this area. They have a hybrid search that allows you to find complimentary items to the one you searched. It’s like finding a rug that matches a chair you like rather than finding more of the same type of chair. 62 percent of millennials surveyed said they would like to be able to search by visual, so while this is mostly being used by clothing retailers and home decor right now, visual search is only going to get better, so think about the ways you can leverage it for your brand! Joy Hawkins — Factors that Affect the Local Algorithm that Don't Impact Organic Proximity varies greatly when comparing local and organic results — just ask Joy of Sterling Sky, who gets real about fake listings while walking through the findings of a recent study. Local results not only vary by city, but even within the same zip codes, there can be drastically different local results. @JoyanneHawkins #mozcon pic.twitter.com/8g6acxUDAq— Lily Ray (@lilyraynyc) July 17, 2019 Here are the seven areas in which the local algorithm diverges from the organic algorithm: Proximity (AKA: how close is the biz to the searcher?)Proximity is the #1 local ranking factor, but the #27 ranking factor on organic. Studies show that having a business that’s close in proximity to the searcher is more beneficial for ranking in the local pack than in traditional organic results. Rank trackingBecause there is so much variance by latitude/longitude, as well as hourly variances, Joy recommends not sending your local business clients ranking reports.Use rank tracking internally, but send clients the leads/sales. This causes less confusion and gets them focused on the main goal. Visit bit.ly/mozcon3 for insights on how to track leads from GMBGMB landing pages (AKA: the website URL you link to from your GMB account)Joy tested linking to the home page (which had more authority/prominence) vs. linking to the local landing page (which had more relevance) and found that traffic went way up when linking to the home page.Before you go switching all your GMB links though, test this for yourself!ReviewsJoy wanted to know how much reviews actually impacted ranking, and what it was exactly about reviews that would help or hurt. She decided to see what would happen to rankings when reviews were removed. This happened to a business who was review gating (a violation of Google’s guidelines) but Joy found that reviews flagged for violations aren’t actually removed, they’re hidden, explaining why “removed” reviews don’t negatively impact local rankings. Possum filterOrganic results can get filtered because of duplicate content, whereas local results can get filtered because they’re too close to another business in the same category. This is called the Possum filter. Keywords in a business name This is against Google’s guidelines but it works sadlyFor example, Joy tested adding the word “salad bar” to a listing that didn’t even have a salad bar and their local rankings for that keyword shot up. Although it works, don’t do it! Google can remove your listing for this type of violation, and they’ve been removing more listings for this reason lately. Fake listingsNew listings can rank even if they have no website, authority, citations, etc. simply because they keyword stuffed their business name. These types of rankings can happen overnight, whereas it can take a year or more to achieve certain organic rankings. Spend time reporting spam listings in your clients’ niches because it can improve your clients’ local rankings. Britney Muller — Featured Snippets: Essentials to Know & How to Target Closing out day three of MozCon was our very own Britney, Sr. SEO scientist extraordinaire, on everyone’s favorite SEO topic: Featured snippets! Why are we so concerned about traffic? What about branding/messaging/share of voice? You can't NOT target a keyword just because it has a Featured Snippet @BritneyMuller #MozCon— Ruth Burr Reedy (@ruthburr) July 17, 2019 We’re seeing more featured snippets than ever before, and they’re not likely going away. It’s time to start capitalizing on this SERP feature so we can start earning brand awareness and traffic for our clients! Here’s how: Know what keywords trigger featured snippets that you rank on page 1 forKnow the searcher’s intentProvide succinct answers Add summaries to popular posts Identify commonly asked questionsLeverage Google’s NLP APIMonitor featured snippets If all else fails, leverage ranking third party sites. Maybe your own site has low authority and isn’t ranking well, but try publishing on Linkedin or Medium instead to get the snippet! There’s lots of debate over whether featured snippets send you more traffic or take it away due to zero-click results, but consider the benefits featured snippets can bring even without the click. Whether featured snippets bring you traffic, increased brand visibility in the SERPs, or both, they’re an opportunity worth chasing. Aaaand, that's a wrap! Thanks for joining us at this year's MozCon! And a HUGE thank you to everyone (Mozzers, partners, and crew) who helped make this year's MozCon possible — we couldn't have done it without all of you.
