Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin January 13, 2006 SEOmoz Induces Blog Posting! SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Early this week I called out some prominent SEO bloggers for not blogging enough. As of today, almost everyone has picked up the slack - I'm humbled and thankful... Now I don't have to cry myself to sleep without my favorite reading. Proving the Point: Dave's got 5 new posts since Tuesday (and he's been interviewed by the new UKGimp - worth a read) Oilman posted something on new year's spam Scott Fish has two good new posts, including this one on SEO & marketing ISOS has two new posts - one on expletives and forums that I particularly enjoyed. Webguerilla has an enjoyable note on Yahoo! Patrick kicks in on the subject of spammy domain names Ralph remains silent... I think we've done fairly well with this. Is there anyone else you'd like to see blogging more regularly? How about less reuglarly? Is it annoying getting 4-6 entries a day on SEOmoz in your feed reader? Do you think to yourself - \"shut the hell up and get some work done Rand!\"? Would it shock you to learn that I can pound out 4 blog entries in 25 minutes? Copied! Back to Top",
