Moz News We’re stoked to announce Moz Academy! Have you ever wanted a resource to learn inbound marketing or a place your team can reference marketing best practices? Well, we hope you do a backflip over Moz Academy. If you have a Moz Subscription, check it out now! Subscription-based content At Moz we produce a wealth of free content in the blog, our guides, Q&A, and pretty much everywhere on the site. We want to do something special for Moz subscribers by transforming our free content and reinventing it for Moz Academy. You could probably scour the Moz Blog and other websites to obtain the information in Moz Academy, but we think having it easily digestible and all in one place is a huge win for Moz subscribers. Moz is excited to add the simplicity and power of Moz Academy to the list of Moz subscription benefits. Why create an inbound marketing school? Moz is extremely passionate about educating our community. In fact, our entire business started as a blog where people could learn about SEO. Moz Academy gives subscribers the power to be better marketers, which will enable them to use our products in more depth and with greater confidence. We want to provide a hub of marketing knowledge that will create a stronger community where people can teach each other while using the Academy as a frame of reference. One could say that Moz Academy is the Mr. Miyagi of inbound marketing. The key to this project is empowering you to kick even more butt than you already do! We hope Moz Academy turns into the one-stop-shop for inbound knowledge for Moz subscribers. Everyone on the team is committed to continually refreshing content and adding new lessons. Again, we really want this to be the easiest and most comprehensive place to learn internet marketing on the web. Furthermore, we’ve designed each lesson with empathy in mind; they will be easily digestible and considerate of your time. That means you can drop in whenever you like and have comfortable breakpoints if you’re brain is exploding with inbound marketing knowledge. Wait, how do I use Moz Academy? Moz Academy is easy to use! Check out these six simple steps: Step 1: Log into your Moz account. Step 2: Go to moz.com/academy. Step 3: Look through the lessons. Step 4: Click a lesson you find interesting. Step 5: Enjoy a video and/or read the lesson below it! Step 6: Crane kick. What lessons do you have right now? We're starting with the following lessons: Inbound Marketing SEO Link Building Social Media Content Marketing We plan to add a lot more! Look for lessons on local SEO, community management, video marketing, email marketing and web analytics. Yup, it's going to be pretty sweet! Well, Moz, what's next for Moz Academy? The future of Moz Academy really depends on how everyone uses it. In the next few months, we want to create a good foundation for beginners and subsequently build up to intermediate-level content. Eventually, we'd like to have sections for beginners lessons, intermediate lessons, and advanced lessons. Keep your eyes peeled, because we’ll be releasing a lot of new stuff! Some of our longer-term goals for Moz Academy are to have interactive quizzes and some sort of gamification. Yes, we know you'd like to track your progress and unlock achievements. That way you can show off how awesome you are at Moz Academy! Eventually, we want Moz Academy to look more like Treehouse and Code School’s online learning platforms. We have a long way to go, but are excited about the journey to get there. With your help and feedback, we can make Moz Academy something awesome. Thanks in advance, and enjoy! Copied! Back to Top",
