By: David Mihm July 21, 2015 Moz Local Officially Launches in the UK Local SEO | Moz Tools To all Moz Local fans in the UK, I'm excited to announce that your wait is over. As the sun rises \"across the pond\" this morning, Moz Local is officially live in the United Kingdom! A bit of backgroundAs many of you know, we released the US version of Moz Local in March 2014. After 12 months of terrific growth in the US, and a boatload of technical improvements and feature releases--especially for Enterprise customers--we released the Check Listing feature for a limited set of partner search engines and directories in the UK in April of this year. Over 20,000 of you have checked your listings (or your clients' listings) in the last 3-1/2 months. Those lookups have helped us refine and improve the background technology immensely (more on that below). We've been just as eager to release the fully-featured product as you've been to use it, and the technical pieces have finally fallen into place for us to do so. How does it work?The concept is the same as the US version of Moz Local: show you how accurately and completely your business is listed on the most important local search platforms and directories, and optimize and perfect as many of those business listings as we can on your behalf. For customers specifically looking for you, accurate business listings are obviously important. For customers who might not know about you yet, they're also among the most important factors for ranking in local searches on Google. Basically, the more times Google sees your name, address, phone, and website listed the same way on quality local websites, the more trust they have in your business, and the higher you're likely to rank. Moz Local is designed to help on both these fronts. To use the product, you simply need to type a name and postcode at moz.com/local. We'll then show you a list of the closest matching listings we found. We prioritize verified listing information that we find on Google or Facebook, and selecting one of those verified listings means we'll be able to distribute it on your behalf. Clicking on a result brings you to a full details report for that listing. We'll show you how accurate and complete your listings are now, and where they could be after using our product. Clicking the tabs beneath the Listing Score graphic will show you some of the incompletions and inconsistencies that publishing your listing with Moz Local will address. For customers with hundreds or thousands of locations, bulk upload is also available using a modified version of your data from Google My Business--feel free to e-mail enterpriselocal@moz.com for more details. Where do we distribute your data?We've prioritized the most important commercial sites in the UK local search ecosystem, and made them the centerpieces of Moz Local. We'll update your data directly on globally-important players Factual and Foursquare, and the UK-specific players CentralIndex, Thomson Local, and the Scoot network--which includes key directories like TouchLocal, The Independent, The Sun, The Mirror, The Daily Scotsman, and Wales Online. We'll be adding two more major destinations shortly, and for those of you who sign up before that time, your listings will be automatically distributed to the additional destinations when the integrations are complete. How much does it cost?The cost per listing is £84/year, which includes distribution to the sites mentioned above with unlimited updates throughout the year, monitoring of your progress over time, geographically- focused reporting, and the ability to find and close duplicate listings right from your Moz Local dashboard--all the great upgrades that my colleague Noam Chitayat blogged about here. What's next?Well, as I mentioned just a couple paragraphs ago, we've got two additional destinations to which we'll be sending your data in very short order. Once those integrations are complete, we'll be just a few weeks away from releasing our biggest set of features since we launched. I look forward to sharing more about these features at BrightonSEO at the end of the summer! For those of you around the world in Canada, Australia, and other countries, we know there's plenty of demand for Moz Local overseas, and we're working as quickly as we can to build additional relationships abroad. And to our friends in the UK, please let us know how we can continue to make the product even better! Copied! Back to Top",
