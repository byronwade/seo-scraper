By: Rand Fishkin February 23, 2006 Wufoo - Woo Hoo! Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. For those of us who have to constantly reference HTML form help pages to create new forms for websites and surveys, there's nothing better than this cool new \"AJAX\" automated form builder. It's intuitive, easy-to-use, well designed and very flexible. It even allows you to specify if a form element is required. I'm not sure what their revenue model will be, but the link love will be coming their way fast and I predict they could charge $2-$5 a shot easily and get it. I know I'd be happy to pay to avoid having to build the darn things by hand. p.s. Big Complaint - It only works in Firefox for me... Broken in IE. Copied! Back to Top",
