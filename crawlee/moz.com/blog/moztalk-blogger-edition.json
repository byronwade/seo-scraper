By: Charlene Ditch November 13, 2014 Need-to-Know SEO and Making Your Blog Audience Fall in Love - Videos from MozTalk 1 Content Marketing | SEO Events Have you ever noticed how Rand is often speaking at conferences all around the world? Well, we realized that those of us here in Seattle rarely get to see them. So we started MozTalks, a free event here at the MozPlex. It normally runs 2-3 hours with multiple speakers, one of whom is Rand. The event is hosted at the Moz HQ and offers time for mingling, appetizers, refreshments and of course, swag. The series is still evolving as we continue to test out new ideas (maybe taking the show on the road), so be on the lookout for any updates. Our most recent MozTalk back in September was a smashing success. Rand and his wife Geraldine, widely known as The Everywhereist, were our featured speakers, and the event focused on blogging, driving traffic to your site, and finding your online personality. Wouldn't it be amazing if driving traffic and building your blog's brand were easy? You launch your blog, you publish awesome content, your metrics go through the roof and everyone just absolutely loves you. Bada bing, bada boom! We all know, however, that the Web is a crazy beast, and the number of individuals constantly sharing their thoughts, stories, expertise, and experiences can be overwhelming. Not to mention that search engine optimization itself has become considerably more advanced and challenging over the years. So how do you stand out from the millions of personalities, blogs, tweets, and other search results? In the presentations below, Rand and Geraldine dive in and offer tips and tricks on how to drive traffic to your site and get your readers to fall in love with you. Rand: What Bloggers Need to Know About SEO in 2014 Geraldine: How to Make Your Audience Fall in Love with Your Blog Top three takeaways As someone who's in the midst of launching my own personal blog, these particular takeaways really resonated with me: Give SEO some love. For many marketers, SEO is a no-brainer, but often times it's harder to convince bloggers that SEO is important. The fact is, search continues to grow massively. There are more than 6 billion searches performed every day, and guess what? 80% of clicks go to organic results. That's where SEO comes in. Here's a little secret: You actually don't have to be an SEO expert to be effective; you just have to be kinda good at it. Be authentic. Connect with your audience through familiarity and by being genuine. This will not only help you grow a loyal and dedicated following, but create a bond between you and the readers. There's no better voice for you than your own. Be patient. If something's not working, don't panic. Traffic doesn't happen overnight but if you stick to your guns and stay true to your efforts then the results will be rewarding. Also, don't be afraid to switch it up and try new things if you have to.Next in the MozTalk seriesRand and Dr. Pete spoke at the second MozTalk in mid-November of 2014.
