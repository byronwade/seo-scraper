(An April Fools' Day Alternative) Moz News After five years at Moz, I’ve found that I work with some of the most creative and talented people I’ve ever met. When it came time to brainstorm ideas for an April Fools video this year, rather than tricking people like every other company does, we decided instead to showcase a few of the talented folks around the Mozplex. Alongside Kristina Keyser, we shot and edited this video so you can see what makes us Mozzers tick when we aren’t building sweet SEO software. We know a lot of you, in the community, have random hobbies like us — we’d love to hear about them! Please share them with us in the comments. Looking for more information on all the cool stuff you just saw? We have that for you, too! Check out my movie, The Last Buck Hunt, on Amazon Prime. If you want to sing Teenage Dirtbag like Chiaryn, start with this karaoke wiki. David would like for you to check out his Seattle-based band, Your Favorite Friend. The Modern Quilt Guild is a great place to meet other quilters and find meet-ups to show off your work. If you're looking for a great community around knitting, Alex recommends Ravelry.

Abe would like for you to know more about making old-school gaming beats by checking out Chip Music’s forum. It's really cool to see that Katie does martial arts at Seven Star Women's Kung Fu, because it's rare to see schools like this just for ladies. Looking for beautiful pictures from around the world?
