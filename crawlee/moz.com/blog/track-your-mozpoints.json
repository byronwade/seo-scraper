Table of Contents Copied! By: Casey Henry October 7, 2009 Track Your MozPoints Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I’m sure many of you are like me and one of the first things you do in the morning is head to SEOmoz and check out the blogs. Along with seeing the new posts, I'm also always checking out my MozPoints and watching them grow, or shrink sometimes. In one of my past posts I did a case study of MozPoints and a few members discussed how they would like to see real-time related graphs of their MozPoints over time. That time is now, I would like to introduce a new little side project I’ve been working on, Mozpoints.com. Mozpoints.com started out as a way for me to see who is moving and shaking things at SEOmoz without having to read everything and try to remember who said what. On the main page of the site you will see it shows the “movers and shakers” for three different time periods, daily, weekly, and monthly. It also shows some thumbing and comment stats for the time period also. Entering your SEOmoz username or click on someone’s name will display a graph of their MozPoints. Currently the graph only displays the lasts 30 days worth of information, but once more data is collected and stored, a new feature will become available to change the time period. When hovering over a data point it will display a few important pieces of information, number of points, rank, number of comments, and number of posts. MozPoint data is updated every night so this data in not exactly real-time, but close enough. Another great little feature is the dynamic badge for your website. This badge is much like the original that SEOmoz offers but with a new feature that self-updates your rank at SEOmoz. I hope that this is something that the SEOmoz community will enjoy and use. I’m hoping to hear suggestions from all of you and make this community grow and connect. If you have any suggestions or ideas for MozPoints.com please feel free to contact me via SEOmoz or leave them in the comments. Special thanks to Danny for giving me the idea via his comment on my previous post. Copied! Back to Top",
