By: Carl Sednaoui August 7, 2013 A One-Stop SEO Bookmarklet That Includes Social Metadata On-page SEO This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Couple years back, as I was just getting started with SEO, I ran across this amazing SEO bookmarklet created by a fellow Mozzer, Troy Meier. I’ve been a faithful user of this SEO bookmarklet for years now but realized that there were some things I wished the bookmarklet included. More specifically, I wish I could see a page’s social metadata at a glance. Inspired by Troy’s work, I created my own version of an SEO bookmarklet. The bookmarklet is broken down in three sections: Overall SEO, Open Graph Metadata for Facebook and Twitter Metadata for Twitter Cards. Below is a full list of what’s included in the bookmarklet -- I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback and suggestions:Basic SEO Title (with character count) Meta description (with character count) Image count with Alt Text count Count of: total links, links with title and, nofollow links Number of H1s, H2s and H3s Rel Canonical Site Cookie Open Graph Metadata for Facebook Facebook App ID OG URL OG Site Name OG Title OG Description OG Type OG Image Twitter Metadata for Twitter Cards Card Type Creator Card Title Card Description Card Image Best of all? There are no ads in the bookmarklet AND the code is fully open sourced on GitHub. To install the bookmarklet simply go to http://carlsednaoui.github.io/seo-bookmarklet/install.html and drag the link to your bookmark toolbar. Here is a preview of the bookmarklet in action: Copied!
