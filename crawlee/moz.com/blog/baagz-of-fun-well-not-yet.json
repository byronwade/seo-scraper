By: Rishi Lakhani September 25, 2007 Baagz of Fun - Well, Not Yet... Technical SEO This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. This is a short one…. I was quite impressed by the YOUmoz blog post on browser compatibility. Funnily enough, I was thinking about it when I came across the new social media site to be – Baagz.com in Mashable earlier today. I bookmarked it to visit it later… but boy was I disappointed. Not that I see anything wrong with the concept, sounds quite interesting and fun: With BAAGZ' simple, integrated user interface it's easy to store and organize your favorite things online in a format that can be easily retrieved, shared and searched by you and other baagerz. What got me was the fact that the site wouldn’t function well in IE 6.0! The truth comes out – if I can't see a site in IE, I kind of put it away - being too lazy to use FF. Now I am not sure how many of their target audience uses FF – but I would bet quite a hefty chunk. The fact that I had to scroll to the bottom of the page to notice a bit of the page missing, and then scroll to the far right to come across the notice that the site only works in FF 2.0 kind of put me off. Maybe they did it intentionally, but to be honest, I am not sure – I would be inclined to make sure that a social networking site is definitely available in IE (most versions), unless of course it's targeted to a niche, e.g for Mac users a Safari version launch would make sense. I may be missing a trick here, but if I am, someone please tell me and put me out of my misery… Copied! Back to Top",
