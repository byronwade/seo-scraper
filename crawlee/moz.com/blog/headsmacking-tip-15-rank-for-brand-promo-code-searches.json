T By: Tom Critchlow October 18, 2009 Headsmacking Tip #15: Rank for Brand Promo Code Searches On-page SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Here's a directly actionable tip that any large brand should probably start doing right now. In fact most people should already have started doing it. Hopefully after reading this post they will. Take a look at these two searches: Promo Codes (US keyphrase:) Voucher Codes (UK keyphrase) Out of all those brand searches across both the UK and the US not a single brand ranks number 1 for their own brand keyphrase. Yes, I was shocked too. In fact, not many of them rank on the first page of results for that query. What to do about it? Sure, you might be wondering how you rank for that phrase - after all you don't want to give away free codes do you? Well why not? Create a page that offers your users a chance to get a promo/voucher code in some way. The most obvious I can think of is to offer a promo code if you sign up to an email newsletter, but if that's too easy perhaps offering a promo code to every 5th email newsletter signup.... Or offer a promo code to anyone who fills out a feedback form...... Or offer a promo code to anyone who links to you ok I've gone too far! You get the idea, if you have any sort of codes then give your users a way of getting them and make a page that can rank for that juicy branded search term. Here's a perfect example of the kind of page I'm talking about: Except of course they neglected to do any SEO for the page, like including the phrase \"Argos voucher codes\" in the title tag so it only ranks 10th...... Still, better than nothing. Anyway, there you go, short but sweet. In fact this post is so short that you could probably fit the whole post in a tweet.
