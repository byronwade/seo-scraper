By: Adam Green July 10, 2007 KeYwORd INSErtioN - A few PPC tips and tricks. Paid Search Marketing (PPC) This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Most PPC account managers know about the keyword insertion tool and the benefits of dynamically inserting the search term into your ad titles. Few, however know about the variations on this tool that can produce some dramatic results for your CTR. The most common way to dynamically insert search queries into an ad is displayed below: {Keyword:internet marketing} - this would result in an add that would look something like this for the search term “search marketing” Provided the search term is within 25 characters long, the user will see whatever their search term dynamically inserted into your ad. If the search term is longer than 25 characters, the default title will appear, in this case “internet marketing”... nothing new here right? What I recently learned are some variations on using the keyword insertion tool that you can try in your campaigns and hopefully improve your results. Fair warning however, using some of these can violate Google’s ad text policy, especially the ALL CAPS keyword insertion. I would be interested to hear anyone’s experiences with these variations and if they have had success. {keyword:internet marketing} - No capitalization, all word(s) are in lower case, this example is used above. {Keyword:internet marketing} - The first word is capitalized and the resulting ad would be: {KeyWord:internet marketing} - The first letter of each word is capitalized {KEYword:internet marketing} - Every letter in first word is capitalized {KEYWord:internet marketing} -Every letter in the first word AND the first letter of the second {KEYWORD:internet marketing} - Every letter is capitalized I am not sure if this tool would recognize/accept variations like {KeyWORd} or {kEYworD} or not but it might be worth testing. I would recommend using {KeyWord:} because it would most likely make your ad appear professional and clean looking to the user. Looking forward to reading the communities experiences using these variations. Copied! Back to Top",
