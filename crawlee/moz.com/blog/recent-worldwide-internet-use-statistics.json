Two excellent reports were released over the past week, highlighting growth and trends in the worldwide Internet adoption and growth market, Europe in particular. The first report, from E-consultancy is called the Internet Statistics Compendium and a small free version of the report is available for download with some great information: The NOP study of UK internet users revealed that 71% of respondents were aware of cookies. [Gomez, 2004] 82% knew how to delete cookies. 55% of them were deleting them on a monthly basis. Screen resolutions are heading towards 1024x768 as the standard. 1024x768 - 51% in Oct. of 2004 800x600 - 34% Higher than 1024x768 - 10% Lower than 800x600 - 1% 93.2% of B2B consumers indicated they would use the net to research the purchase before buying. [Enquiro 2004] Of those using net research, only 4.46% would not use a search engine. Search was the â€˜first resourceâ€™ for research for 63.9% of respondents, beating manufacturer sites and portals. 82.9% used Google.The second report of interest comes from a CRM Today report on growth in the European Search Marketing segement.
