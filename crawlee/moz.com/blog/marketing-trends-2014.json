By: Cyrus Shepard January 28, 2014 New Top Strategies, Salaries and Tools: Announcing the 2014 Industry Survey Results Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Late last year we set out to discover the top tools, tactics, and trends of the online marketing world. With the help of our partners, over 3700 participated in this year's Industry Survey. Today, Moz is proud to present the results. Read the Industry Survey 2014 Results Shifting demographics and salaries This year's data was analyzed by Dr. Pete Meyers, Moz's Resident Marketing Scientist. One area we've tracked for several years is the demographic makeup of professionals working in the online marketing industry. Among the shifts the survey has revealed is a rise in the number of women working in the field. This year's respondents were 28.3% female, up from 20.7% in 2010, although theses numbers indicate we still have a long way to go. The survey also examines salaries, as indicated by the graphic below showing the median salary by role of respondents around the world. The full data set (see below) contains even more granular information. Median Salary by Role Tools and strategies in 2014 In the age of (not provided), Google's Hummingbird update and changing practices in the world of link building and content marketing, the survey tracts both shifting tactics and tools inbound marketers most use to perform their jobs.
