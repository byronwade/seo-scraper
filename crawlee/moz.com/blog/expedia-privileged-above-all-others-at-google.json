By: Rand Fishkin September 6, 2006 Expedia Privileged Above All Others at Google Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Google has been using \"onebox\" results for travel related searches since at least October of 2005. I'm forced to wonder if, during the entirety of that period, Google's been sending the default link to Expedia. For example: I searched for Seattle to New York and got:Then clicked the \"Flights from Seattle/Tacoma, WA to New York, NY\" - the most obvious of the links, which sent me to: This seems very un-Google-like... Am I the only one being served Expedia by default? I tried the searches in SF this morning and at home in Seattle tonight with the same results. More searches produced similar defaults: Hong Kong to Tapei Calcutta to Mumbai (interesting that they show \"Bombay\" in the results) Chicago to Denver London to Paris The choices (Expedia, Travelocity, Priceline, Orbitz & Hotwire) represent the most popular travel booking sites, and there's already some inherent bias in serving those choices, but defaulting to Expedia seems like playing favorites...
