By: rmccarley February 12, 2007 Power to the People! 7 Tips for Using Your Voice Online Content Marketing This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. When you write with your own voice you can break through to the reader on an emotional level. This gives them a tangible connection with you. This also enhances the user experience by letting them know there is a real human being in the company and it adds personality to your website. When working with a medium as impersonal as a website having a voice can be a real comfort and build trust with your readers. As mentioned previously, I love Rebecca's blog-writing style. It comes through as genuine and all her own. When reading a post by Rebecca I feel I could be listening to her in person. No doubt about it, Rebecca's \"voice\" comes through her writing. Enough moz-butt kissing: It's great Rebecca has a writing ability that resonates with the viewer but what about the rest of us? I've struggled with finding my own voice online. At first it was in the forums as an SEO-newbie trying (desperately) to not sound too stupid. It didn't work. Tip #1: Be yourself even if you sound dumb. What?! I can feel the resistance already: I have to make a good impression I have professional services to offer I have to watch my reputation And so on... We're all learning. It's part of being a human being. And the Internet - as technical as it is - is driven by people-power. Nobody expects you to be perfect or know everything. In fact, one of the biggest mistakes you can make is giving a customer a convincing bullshit answer. Just look at all the damage that has already done to our industry! Please don't be that guy! …or gal! \"Freedom is not worth having if it does not connote freedom to err. It passes my comprehension how human beings, be they ever so experienced and able, can delight in depriving other human beings of that precious right.\" - Mahatma Gandhi, 1931 Tip #2: Passion kicks ass - love (notes) will set you free. Years ago I lived in Tacoma, WA. I dated a girl that moved to California. We did the long-distance thing and money was tight so long phone conversations were out. And NOBODY can read my handwriting. So that left us with this new thing called email. I was a big hit with email. It turns out I could write to her in ways I couldn't talk to her (I'm pretty shy about... certain... uh, things). Fast-forward a bunch of years and the same technique worked with my last girlfriend - who is now my wife - thank you very much! If you write about things you are passionate about your voice can’t help but come through! Tip #3: Use verbal nofollows. Closely related to the first tip but a little different, if you know something for sure then state it as fact. If you believe something, think something, or figure something should, may, might, possibly be... say so. Just be sure to differentiate between fact and feeling. By doing this you are being honest and that comes through. This is liberating for me. I like discussing stuff I don't know about - it's how I learn. Without the pressure of being The Authority there is a lot more I can write about and even more conversations I can be a part of. Tip #4: Use your own words. In the trap to impress, people sometimes drag out a dictionary to find big words to say simple things. When you do this you end up sounding artificial, turning off your audience. You also risk using the wrong word. Maybe this tip should be renamed: Be yourself even if it keeps you from sounding dumb. Smaller, common words are easier to read. If you don't have a big vocabulary, don't sweat it. Part of why viewers are at your site is because they want your take on things, not Webster's. Tip #5: Never release anything without proofing it several times. By just getting words on paper with the sure knowledge that you will go back and clean it up, you’ll find more of your natural voice coming through. The key is to always - always! - proof your writing so you gain confidence in your system. This removes the stress of trying to get things right the fist time, muting your voice. Tip #6: Don't polish the life out of your writing. When I was an art major, the biggest lesson I got was when to stop painting. I can paint any object, person or landscape with almost photographic results. But then, why not use a camera? Paintings with too much polish lack style... they lack life. The same applies to writing. Too much editing can silence your voice. Be perfectly imperfect. Tip #7: Write often to get past the fear of your own voice. Remember listening to yourself on a tape recorder for the first time? It sounded weird. Writing is the same way. We are often uncomfortable inserting our personalities into writing because it just “sounds” strange to us. But the more you do it, the more you get used to it. If this is a real problem for you try writing every day. You don’t have to publish the writing – it can be between you and your computer. And you can even delete it later. Many websites become cold and distant from the viewer by being too “professional”. By adding your voice you can make a real difference in how your website is perceived by the reader. You can make the ordinary… a connection. You can turn a task into an experience. A journey for two: you and the viewer. PS. One last bonus tip: Have Fun! Even technical information can be easier to read with a couple dorky jokes thrown in. This doesn't just add a personal touch; it takes your writing one step further making it more usable! Copied! Back to Top",
