By: Charlie Gray October 2, 2007 Keyword Difficulty tool: Have you ever seen one over 91%? SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Most of us have use the SEOmoz keyword difficulty tool at one time or another. I became curious today as I was running some reports that I expected very high competition from, and yet I still didn't break 91%. Intrigued, I ran a report on something that should easily break 91%. \"Car\" returned a 76% difficulty. Going for the gold, I ran a report on the most competitive term I could possibly think of: Porn. I never knew how easy it was to own that term, because it actually returned a difficulty of 66%! We can all make a lot more money by just going after this reasonably easy keyword, right? Based on this, I don't even think it's possible to get over 91% difficulty. Has anyone ever seen it? Furthermore, I think the tool might actually be broken. One part of the tool checks Google to see how many results there are for the term in quotes. It reported (incorrectly) that \"porn\" and \"car\" both returned 0 results. Maybe the IP address was banned? Summation: The question is, have you ever seen a keyword with a difficulty over 91%?
