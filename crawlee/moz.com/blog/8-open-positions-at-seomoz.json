By: Rand Fishkin April 29, 2011 8 Open Positions at SEOmoz, Just Named Seattle's #6 Best Place to Work Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Out of the many recent accomplishments that we've had, perhaps none is more exciting than the recent publicity we received from being named in Seattle's Top 10 Places to Work by Seattle Met Magazine: What do rubber band balls, coffee, cupcakes & a workspace w/ no computer have in common? The cover of this month's Seattle Met magazine! But, magazine articles aren't the only things that should entice you to join our ragtag bunch... Our Office When you step foot inside SEOmoz, you'll be forced to breakdance... Well, OK, that's only if you mindlessly obey floor diagrams. You will, however, find a space that's fun, productive, light-filled and only a block away from the Pike Place Market. We have pretty cool meeting rooms, too. Lots of windows help keep the gloomy Seattle weather from damaging our sun-starved bodies Xbox Kinect on Friday Nights Our Team The 34 people who work at the MozPlex are absolutely amazing. I noted in the Seattle Met piece that we bias toward folks who are not only smart and capable, but fit our culture of TAGFEE. That's resulted in a group that I'm proud to call co-workers and friends. Cyrus + Jen from Marketing, Chas from Engineering + Miranda from Product If you've met Moz team members at events or interacted with us over the web or phone, you've probably already been impressed. If you haven't... you should apply for an interview at one of the positions below just to come to say Hi! :-) (OK, probably not really, but you should at least come to our NYC meetup May 12, the Distilled Boston conference or MozCon this summer). Our Mission: Simplify Organic Web Marketing We're privileged to tackle a huge, meaningful problem in a massive market. It's our goal to take what is today a massive, complex set of tasks + challenges and make them accessible to non-experts, trackable via solid data and provide recommendations + automation to make improvement easy. This stuff is really hard. We're building software to make it less so. If that's something you're passionate about, we think there's no better place to be. Our Customers + Community: More than a million strong! In March, SEOmoz + OSE had its first ever combined 1million+ visit month: As if you needed another reason not to trust Alexa, Compete, Quantcast, etc. :-) Over the years, millions of people have used our tools + resources to learn more about search/web marketing and improve their sites. Our market position is an exciting one, filled with opportunity, but we know that great responsibility comes with that privilege. One of the best things we can offer to prospective employees is the chance to have a big impact on an emerging field - it's the same thing that makes me excited to come to the office (or hop on a plane) every morning. We're Hiring Eight Exceptional People! In addition to our ongoing search for world-class software engineers, I’m thrilled to announce eight new positions on the Moz team: SEOmoz wants people who believe in our mission and in TAGFEE.

If you're new to SEOmoz but curious to learn more, we are too and we hope you'll take that first step by clicking and applying to one of the positions below: Awesome Job #1: Marketing Oracle (aka Quality Content Honcho) Producing exceptional content has been the foundation of our strategy since the beginning. We're looking for someone to produce extraordinary content for us and manage our entire content production process (the blog, news, guides, videos, and lots more). Whether it's original research, data analysis, or thought leadership in the inbound marketing space, we're looking for someone who can become our best blogger and produce our most linked-to content. You should have a proven track record of producing quality, engaging content for social media audiences, experience and knowledge of all forms of inbound marketing, and the ability to see where things are headed (i.e. be a marketing oracle). Quality content is of the utmost importance to us, and you must share this obsession. You should be able to distill complex ideas into simple ones, create visualizations and infographics of data sets, and have a deep-rooted desire to teach and communicate ideas online. You’re abreast of the latest industry news and able to quickly respond and communicate the implications to our community.

You’re obsessed with managing data to a positive ROI. You know how to take charge of new channels that aren’t even popular yet (Twitter Advertising, for example) or can learn how to very quickly. You make use of acronyms like PPC, CRO, CPA, CPM, CPC in daily conversation. You don’t just know these acronyms, you have years of practical experience working with them. When it comes to performance marketing, you believe in a data-driven culture and the power of ongoing testing. If you like getting creative on a daily basis, testing new marketing waters, and collaborating with other passionate marketers, then this position is all you.

You have a desire to work with a bunch of technology rockstars who are passionate about developing stellar Internet marketing software. You often find yourself daydreaming about networking, development support, and production support. People often catch you using words like Cisco, MySql, and Samba constantly. You’ll provide desktop support for over thirty MozStaff and those to come in our rapidly growing office. We would love for you to work with and support the development team from prototype to staging to production; providing systems resources, setup, and monitoring.

This role will also be involved with periodic maintenance of current site design material. You should be a solid communicator (iambic pentameter optional), actively seeking and spreading inspiration, regularly challenging the status quo of our current designs, and curiously seeking out and learning about new tools and design trends.
