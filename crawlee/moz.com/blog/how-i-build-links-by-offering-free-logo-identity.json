By: Moosa Hemani September 13, 2013 How I build Links by Offering Free Logo Identity Link Building This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Link building sounds easy in some of the common niches like Technology, Marketing and Finance because there are tons of blogs already available and bloggers and industry people are already ready to give away links to good resources. The problem with these niches is that they are extremely competitive and some links from good blogs are not enough, you might need to have tons and literally tons of links from diversified ways to achieve your target and win over others. Guest blogging, broken link building and good outreach does help but I had to do something extraordinary to bring quality links that point back to my client’s website. I tried something that really works well for me; not only I get some good links from quality websites but also managed to get considerable reputation and connections with other peers in the industry. Although the idea was paid but if you are getting positive branding and good connections with other peers in the industry a little investment is not bad at all. Help Them Re-Brand their Identities! I have noticed the trend that bloggers and websites (nonprofits) when change or rebrand their logo identities, they tend to tell people about it either through their blog posts or through a press release. If the blog or a website is very famous among the niche new journalists and quick blog owners usually tend to talk about this. The idea was pretty much clear to me, I have to find the websites and blogs who are ready to rebrand their logos and I have to send them the logos for FREE. Even if they don’t change their logos and only positively discuss about my effort on their blog will be enough for me because this way I can cater targeted audience as well as links. Problem! The idea was good but there are several problems that I knew can arise, I need the help of the creative designer because no one is going to like the clip art logos plus I have to give them several different design concepts as one is not enough for anyone and they can easily say no to it. Solution! Having a designer was not really a solution as it will be extremely expensive for me to hire one but a little research on the internet allow me to find a logo maker website called Design Mantic and the reason why it was special among other is because the logos are all custom made and are not clip art so it can easily cater the attention of anyone. How I go with it! Ok, now I knew how to go with this idea step by step! Step 1: Find Websites and Blogs under your niche I tried to focus and target the blogs and websites (nonprofits) under my niche. Although this could be done manually but it would have taken a lot more time than usual so I used link prospector for that! I added the keywords that I was targeting and it give me the list of blogs and websites under my niche. The data was all mixed up so I manually had to sort the data and exclude the blogs and websites (non profits) under my niche. Pro Tip: Use the Exclude feature on link prospector or you will end up having lots of junk data that you probably don’t need! Step 2: Sort and Select Manually I prefer and recommend you to do this step manually and this is because I don’t think any tool can tell help you analyse which blogs and websites are perfect target for you. While I was selecting the websites here are thing things i considered as important. DA of the website, I would prefer to select the websites and blogs with decent domain authority. Link profile of the selected website/blogs should be clean Should have a considerably good readership Have a bad or at least not really goo brand’s identity (logo) It’s good if the blog or website have a good social circle on different social platforms. Step 3: Outreach and Offer The way you are going to write an email will be the most important part of the success or failure of you campaign. Try reading this article by me on Moz that talks about how to write an email that gets a better rate of response. Describe your offer them in a nice and humble manner so that they gets interested in it! One of the emails that I sent to one of my prospect was something like this! Hello Jack, I was going through your blog to learn some new stuff about design and how it impacts on conversion rate; your latest post about this was really informative and actionable for SMB owners. I simply loved and share it to my network! Your overall blog is superb but one thing I wondered about was your brand’s identity design, which is kind of below the average mark in my opinion! How about I pass you few samples that might fit your blog and if you like them you can use it as your blog’s logo identity and may be share the word about this with your readers? :) Looking forward to hearing from you! Regards, Moosa Hemani. Step 4: Sort Responses and Send the samples One you will send the personalized emails to all the websites and blogs you will start getting responses within few days. Just put the positive responses at one end and start sending the samples by using design Mantic. All you have to do is to write your perspective’s website/blog’s name in the bar and within few seconds you will be able to see multiple logo design concepts. Not all will be fit but you can always select few of them and make a jpg of it and send it to that person for review purposes. Once they finalize the logo, you can proceed from there, make necessary edits and download the final version by paying a small amount. Step 5: Stay Connected and Encourage them to talk about it! Once they take the final logo, it is important for you to stay connected with them and encourages them about marketing their new (upcoming) logo through their blog, social media and may be press release. Do not push them too much or else you might end up losing this relationship. Once they talk about the logo and you on any of the channel that includes PR, social media or blog just stay active their and communicate with their readership positively as this can help you double your links and may be some good relationships that might help the business grow! Pro Tip: Just be patient and calm down because sometime it will take a little more time than usual. Offering a free logo identity to niche related blogs and non profits is defiantly going to give you good links but this will also offer you quality relationships and a positive word of mouth within the niche which is always more powerful than any other form of marketing.
