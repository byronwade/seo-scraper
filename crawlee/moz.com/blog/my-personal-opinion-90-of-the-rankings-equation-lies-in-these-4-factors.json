By: Rand Fishkin September 26, 2007 My Personal Opinion - 90% of the Rankings Equation Lies in These 4 Factors Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I think that sometimes, we in the field of search marketing try to make the concept of ranking more difficult than it really is. True - there are hundreds of ways to build a link, an infinite number of keywords, thousands of unique sources to drive traffic along with analytics, design, usability, code structure, conversion testing, etc. However, when it comes to the very specific question of how to rank well for a particular keyword in standard organic results at the engines, you're really only talking about a few big key components. #1 - Keyword Usage & Content Relevance While I don't believe in keyword density (reference: nonsense), there's no doubt that using your keywords intelligently and creating a page that is actually relevant to the query and searcher intent is critical to ranking well. My general best practice is to use the primary keyword phrase as follows: In the title tag once, and possibly twice (or as a variation) if it makes sense and sounds good (subjective, but necessary) Once in the H1 header tag of the page At least 3X in the body copy on the page (sometimes a few more times if there's a lot of text content) At least once in bold At least once in the alt tag of an image Once in the URL At least once (sometimes 2X when it makes sense) in the meta description tag Generally not in link anchor text on the page itself (this is a bit more complex - see this post for details) For those who've done the nonsense words testing to see how the engines respond, you know that you can certainly get some extra value out of going wild and stuffing the keywords all over the page, but we've also seen that once you reach about this level of saturation I've described above, you're getting about 95% of the value you can get, and even the tiniest amount of extra link juice can make a page like this outrank a \"super-stuffed\" page (usually). #2 - Raw Link Juice Some people call this PageRank or link weight or link power - basically it refers to the raw quantity of global link popularity ascribed to the page. You can grow this with internal links (from your own site) and external links (from other sites). A page with a phenomenal amount of global link power, even if the sources aren't particularly relevant and the keywords are barely used, can still rank remarkably well in Google & Yahoo! (MSN & Ask are both a bit more keyword & subject focused from what we've seen). Link juice operates on the basic principle that was used in the early PageRank formula - that pages on the web have some (low) inherent level of importance and that the link structure of the web could help to point out pages with greater and lesser value. Those pages that were linked to by many thousands of pages were very important and thus, when they linked to other pages, those pages must, by extension, also have great importance. Carrying this theory back to your own pages, you can see how raw link juice will have a large impact on how the search engines score their rankings. Growing global link popularity requires both link building (so your site has enough link juice) and intelligent internal link structure (to ensure that you're flowing that juice to the right places). #3 - Anchor Text Weight As the search engines evolved in the early 2000's, they picked up on the usage of anchor text and found that by weighting the keywords and phrases pages used to link, they could get an even better idea of what pages would be about and which were most relevant to particular subjects. The anchor text of links is now a critical part of the ranking equation, and when seen in great quantity, it can overshadow many other ranking factors - you can see plenty of web pages that are weaker in all the other three factors I describe here ranking primarily because they've earned (or, oftentimes for commercial terms, bought) many hundreds or thousands of links with the precise anchor text of the phrase they're targeting. Note that anchor text comes from both internal and external links, so if you're trying to optimize, it's wise to think about how you're linking to material from your own pages - using generic links or image links may cost you some of the ranking power you'd otherwise earn by having internal links with accurate, relevant anchor text. However, you can go overboard here, so be cautious - and note that 100,000 internal pages linking with anchor text doesn't provide the same value as 100,000 external links with that text. #4 - Domain Authority This is the most complex of the factors I describe in this post. Basically, domain trust refers to a variety of signals about a site that the search engines use to determine legitimacy. Does the domain have a history in the engine? Do lots of people search for and use the domain? Does the domain have high quality links pointing to it from other trustworthy sources? Does the domain link out primarily to other trusted sites? Do analytics and registration information and temporal link growth fit with expected patterns? To influence this variable positively, all you really need to do is operate your site in a manner consistent with the engines' guidelines. If you want to earn a lot of trust early on in a domain's life, get lots of sites that the engines already trust to link to you. And if you're looking to spoil that trust, link out to bad neighborhoods, use manipulative link growth practices that don't match up to queries or traffic patterns and play the churn & burn game. As a wrap up, I'd love to hear your opinions on these four factors and whether you think there should be 5, 3 or 20 instead. p.s. Remember that this post is my personal opinion only! Sure - I'm basing it on my experience, which is relatively robust, but I don't doubt that others have there have very different conceptions of what comprises the bulk of the rankings equation, so please use your own judgment (note our new blog disclaimer, which applies to everything you read here).
