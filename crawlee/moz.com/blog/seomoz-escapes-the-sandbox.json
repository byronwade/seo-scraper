By: Rand Fishkin November 4, 2005 SEOmoz Escapes the Sandbox Blogging The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I suppose it had to happen at some point. SEOmoz is finally sandbox free for the first time since our move to this domain 9 months ago. We aren't alone, either. Many folks had sites escape, and I'm happy for all of them. It looks like our 12,000+ all-natural links (never link built for this site, just link-baited) finally paid off. Check out our current rankings for all sorts of nifty (but no traffic) phrases: Search Engine Ranking Factors - #1 SEO Quiz - #1 Sandbox Detection - #1 Keyword Difficulty - #1 Ebay it Campaign - #1 SEM Exam - #1 SEO Articles - #14 SES NYC - #3 Free SEO Tools - #496 (OK, so bad example there, but at least we're #7 allinanchor) Black Hat Spam - #4 MSN Interview - #4 and #5 301 Redirects - #7 Link Building Tactics - #1 Google's Sandbox - #5 SEO - not in the top 1000, but allinanchor, we're #183, right behind SEO Tech (a Las Vegas firm with a very... classic... design) So... We're doing better. We don't yet rank for any big money terms, but Google's sent about 100 visitors per day to us, as opposed to the 10-20 they've been sending over the past 9 months. If you've got a happy sandbox escaping story, please share. p.s. I'm thinking about re-directing SEOmoz.org to SEOmoz.com just to mess with GG and see how long we can get put back in :) Copied!
