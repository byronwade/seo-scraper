By: Jon July 30, 2015 ​​Measure Your Mobile Rankings and Search Visibility in Moz Analytics Moz Tools | Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. We have launched a couple of new things in Moz Pro that we are excited to share with you all: Mobile Rankings and a Search Visibility score. If you want, you can jump right in by heading to a campaign and adding a mobile engine, or keep reading for more details! Track your mobile vs. desktop rankings in Moz AnalyticsMobilegeddon came and went with slightly less fanfare than expected, somewhat due to the vast 'Mobile Friendly' updates we all did at super short notice (nice work everyone!). Nevertheless, mobile rankings visibility is now firmly on everyone's radar, and will only become more important over time. Now you can track your campaigns' mobile rankings for all of the same keywords and locations you are tracking on desktop. For this campaign my mobile visibility is almost 20% lower than my desktop visibility and falling; I can drill down to find out why Clicking on this will take you into a new Engines tab within your Keyword Rankings page where you can find a more detailed version of this chart as well as a tabular view by keyword for both desktop and mobile. Here you can also filter by label and location. Here I can see Search Visibility across engines including mobile; in this case, for my branded keywords. We have given an extra engine to all campaignsWe've given customers an extra engine for each campaign, increasing the number from 3 to 4. Use the extra slot to add the mobile engine and unlock your mobile data! We will begin to track mobile rankings within 24 hours of adding to a campaign. Once you are set up, you will notice a new chart on your dashboard showing visibility for Desktop vs. Mobile Search Visibility. Measure your Search Visibility score vs. competitors The overall Search Visibility for my campaign Along with this change we have also added a Search Visibility score to your rankings data. Use your visibility score to track and report on your overall campaign ranking performance, compare to your competitors, and look for any large shifts that might indicate penalties or algorithm changes. For a deeper drill-down into your data you can also segment your visibility score by keyword labels or locations. Visit the rankings summary page on any campaign to get started. How is Search Visibility calculated?Good question! The Search Visibility score is the percentage of clicks we estimate you receive based on your rankings positions, across all of your keywords. We take each ranking position for each keyword, multiply by an estimated click-thru-rate, and then take the average of all of your keywords. You can think of it as the percentage of your SERPs that you own. The score is expressed as a percentage, though scores of 100% would be almost impossible unless you are tracking keywords using the \"site:\" modifier. It is probably more useful to measure yourself vs. your competitors rather than focus on the actual score, but, as a rule of thumb, mid-40s is probably the realistic maximum for non-branded keywords. Jeremy, our Moz Analytics TPM, came up with this metaphor: Think of the SERPs for your keywords as villages. Each position on the SERP is a plot of land in SERP-village. The Search Visibility score is the average amount of plots you own in each SERP-village. Prime real estate plots (i.e., better ranking positions, like #1) are worth more. A complete monopoly of real estate in SERP-village would equate to a score of 100%. The Search Visibility score equates to how much total land you own in all SERP-villages. Some neat ways to use this feature Label and group your keywords, particularly when you add them – As visibility score is an average of all of your keywords, when you add or remove keywords from your campaign you will likely see fluctuations in the score that are unrelated to performance. Solve this by getting in the habit of labeling keywords when you add them. Then segment your data by these labels to track performance of specific keyword groups over time. See how location affects your mobile rankings – Using the Engines tab in Keyword Rankings, use the filters to select just local keywords. Look for big differences between Mobile and Desktop where Google might be assuming local intent for mobile searches but not for desktop. Check out how your competitors perform for these keywords.
