Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin August 31, 2005 Got 15 Minutes? We've got a new SEO/M Exam Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. After a much longer than expected delay from May, when I posted the original SEO Quiz, we've got a new, full-featured SEM Exam. It's fun and a great way to pass the last few lazy days of summer before activity picks up again after Labor Day. The exam is longer than the quiz; 44 questions in 4 sections. Once again, it features a leaderboard and the results of the exam are viewable via your user profile. Note that taking the quiz multiple times is possible and fun, but your first score will be the one we stick you with, so study up (but please, don't cheat - it ruins all the fun). If you'd like, we've even got a neat little graphic you can display on your own site to show your score. Of note: the last time we did this I got a lot of angry e-mails about the quiz's format and questions. I want to make clear that this is primarily for fun and learning, and while I'd love to receive responses about any errors or omissions (feel free to post them in this thread), the exam, like the quiz is purely for your enjoyment, so please try not to get too upset. One last feature - if you forget to fill in a question, the exam will ask you to enter it before submitting (this helps prevent folks from accidentally missing something).
