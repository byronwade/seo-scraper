By: Rand Fishkin December 19, 2006 Everything in the Digg, Reddit & Netscape Algorithms Content Marketing The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. At work today, Matt noted that he found Digg's algorithm far more interesting than Google's. I was shocked - after all, Digg isn't nearly as complex or widely used as Google, but with its rising popularity in the tech space, I could, at least, empathize with why he might feel that way. I also took it as a challenge to expose all the possible elements that might be in an algorithm at Digg, Reddit, Netscape, Shoutwire or other social-news-voting sites. Let's see how I do: BTW - I'm going to use a lot of Digg-specific terminology, despite the fact that I'm referring to all of the sites above. Number of votes over time Uses a floating target based on relative levels of popularity (as mentioned in timing below) Any number of votes in a very short period (if not manipulative) is stronger than the same number of votes over a longer period. Domain of link Has it previously had content submitted? If so, did that content receive votes, get marked as spam/lame, make the front page, etc? Has the domain been manually/automatically flagged for being manipulative Profile of submitter Have they submitted high quality stories in the past? Have they submitted spam/lame stories in the past? How many friends do they have? This could make it harder or easier to get a story Dugg (harder if they have thousands of friends, but possibly easier if they have at least a few) How many submissions have they made? What is their success rate? How long has the member been around? New registrants could be a clear sign of spam Profiles of voters (as above) Timing of submission If a low number of stories have recently made the front page in a given sector or overall, the story is more likely to get on top with fewer votes If a high number of recent submissions, the opposite may be true Time of day - if 50 people all tag a site at 3:00am, that might be a red flag Similarity to other links (duplicate) Source of votes From the same IP address or IP block From the same geographic region (that's not a hotspot for Digg users) From the same group as has voted on previous content from a domain or string of domains From a group of users who aren't regular participants/voters Manual review as it hits the homepage Many Digg users may not realize it, but all stories to hit the frontpage get a manual, editorial review that may pull the story. This often happens with content the editors feel is marketing-focused, driven by marketing dollars or has a marketing agenda. Reddit does this, too, but it's not instantaneous Netscape used to do it, but some have speculated the the level of oversight fluctuates As a quick example, Brian Clark (of Copyblogger) had this post hit Digg's homepage last week for a scant minute or so before the editors pulled it. Number of comments Potentially could be used to detect patterns, though I've seen a lot of Dugg stories that had very few comments, so this might not be a great signal Number of views An abnormally high ratio of views with few Diggs could mean that people aren't fans of the content In my opinion, this is a low signal, and down votes or lame/spam would earn more weight in bringing down a story Down votes Although Digg doesn't specifically have them, Reddit does and surely uses them as an influential factor Digg, Netscape and Shoutwire all use flag systems which could be similarly interpreted Source of Votes I suspect that Digg would follow how users normally reach pages (through friends, via direct links, via email/type-in, etc.) If an abnormally high number of folks came via an uncommon method to a Digg page (for example, with no referring URL, possibly signifying a mass email or IM link), Digg might want to discount the value of those votes In a wonderful irony, the Digg website appears to have crashed tonight (a likely cause could be the new re-design, which Neil details at SELand). So, what do you think? Are there other elements you'd consider having in your own social media voting site? Any obvious ones I neglected to mention? Copied! Back to Top",
