With a healthy mix of fresh faces joining us for the first time and fan favorites making a return appearance, our speaker lineup this year is bound to make waves.

Register for MozCon The Emcees We have two incredibly entertaining MozCon Emcees this year to guide you through each day and keep the show rolling along: Ola King User Researcher | Moz Rob Ousbey SEO Consultant The Speakers + Agenda Take a gander at the full lineup of who you'll see on stage this year, along with what they'll be presenting: Amalia Fowler Founder | Good AF Consulting Leadership and Community in Search Marketing: Strong Teams, Better Results As search marketers, we spend a lot of time optimizing our campaigns, but don't have the same time to put into nurturing our teams. This is especially true when faced with things like a global pandemic, the great resignation, increased competition and the whims of Google. It's easy to forget that taking purposeful action in our working relationships can help lead us to better results. In this practical and actionable talk, we'll bust the myth that you have to be a manager to have influence, discuss the importance of leadership and community, identify three key characteristics strong teams have in common, get tips on fostering those characteristics regardless of your role, and discuss how taking the time to do this serves all of us, clients included. Amanda Milligan Head of Marketing | Stacker The Untapped Power of Content Syndication Many marketers have long wondered whether syndicated content has SEO value. To help provide an answer, Amanda walks through case studies that illustrate the significant impact syndicated content strategies can have on your site's authority, rankings, and traffic. Amanda Jordan Director of Digital Strategy | RicketyRoo The Future of Local Landing Pages Location landing pages are extremely important for local business but are often repetitive and uninteresting.

We'll discuss ways to incorporate first party data, third party data, and user generated content to create local landing pages that don't fall short. Andy Crestodina Co-founder / CMO | Orbit Media Studios SERP Strategies Every keyphrase is a competition. But the best competitor for that competition depends on what you see in the SERP. Getting your page to rank organically is only one of the many possible strategies. In this talk, Andy will explain big picture strategies in the context of ever-more crowded search results pages. Areej AbuAli Head of SEO | Papier Unlocking the Hidden Potential of Product Listing Pages E-commerce website product listing pages contain hidden potential. This talk is all about unlocking the magic of your listing pages by making the most out of filters and internal linking. Instead of being fixated on those landing page head terms, let’s turn our attention to the indexability of long-tail pages with high conversion. Whether you work in e-commerce or not, we’ll also cover how to embed yourself within tech teams and analyze impactful changes. Chris Long VP of Marketing | Go Fish Digital Advanced On-Page Optimization Take your on-page optimizations to the next-level using advanced tactics for one of the most common SEO tasks. This presentation goes beyond simply adding keywords.

Debbie Chew SEO Manager | Dialpad How to Capitalize on the Link Potential of a Research Report There are many types of link magnets, but there's one that'll never go out of style: data-backed research reports. When done well, you're creating a piece of content that helps your E-A-T, drives backlinks, and is genuinely interesting content for your target audience. This talk will cover the different steps needed not just to create a research report, but to create one that can get links. Emily Brady SEO Consultant Get Your Local SEO Recipe Right with Content & Schema Local SEO can be so much more than off-site listings, so let’s talk about it!

Karen Hopper Performance Marketing Strategist | Razorfish Beyond the Button: Tests that Actually Move the Needle In a world that has a million different options for every creative element... where do you start?

This session will walk through how to understand your testing opportunities, generate test ideas, and measure your results with scientific accuracy. Lidia Infante Senior SEO Manager | Big Commerce SEO Gap Analysis: Leverage Your Competitor's Performance Ranking is as easy or as hard as doing better than your competitors.

Lily Ray Senior Director, SEO & Head of Organic Research | Amsive Digital Why Real Expertise is the Most Important Ranking Factor of Them All In this presentation, Lily will use real data to demonstrate how the rise of E-A-T has led to Google prioritizing expertise and authority above all else. Miracle Inameti-Archibong SEO Lead (Insurance) | MoneySuperMarket Group Achieve Accessibility Goals with Machine Learning 3.8 million US adults aged 21-64 have a visual impairment, but 98% of the world’s top one million websites don’t offer full accessibility.

Discover what these factors are, how to root them out, and how to help your existing team members reach their potential. Dr. Pete Meyers Marketing Scientist | Moz Rabbit Holes: How Google Pushes Us Down The Funnel As an SEO, you've probably fallen down the rabbit hole of \"organic\" results that lead to more Google SERPs. If you map that rabbit hole, you'll see a systematic effort to push searchers down the funnel to commercial results. Why is Google doing this, what does it mean for SEO, and what can we learn about our own customers' journeys? Petra Kis-Herczegh Solutions Engineer | Yext Things I Learned from Sales Teams that Every SEO Should Know Whether you're trying to build a business case or get buy-in for your SEO project, some of the core challenges will come down to the same thing: How well can you sell it? As SEOs, we often forget that, even though we spend our day-to-day analyzing data and optimizing content and websites for bots, at the end of the day, we are working with human beings — and some of those people have decision-making power over what we can and can't achieve in our roles. This is where learning a good set of sales skills becomes crucial. In this talk, Petra will explore some of the key skills and methods sales teams use, and how you can apply these to your SEO work. Tina Fleming Senior Brand Strategist | Designzillas How Marketing Data Intelligence Skyrocketed Our B2B Conversions If you want to geek out on data, you've come to the right session. And we're not talking about Google Analytics or your plain old CRM data.

In this presentation, Tina will demystify the basics of marketing data intelligence, reveal actionable strategies for your day-to-day conversion marketing, and share real examples of how her agency has skyrocketed B2B conversions with the addition of marketing intelligence. Tom Capper Senior Search Scientist | Moz Trash In, Garbage Out: A Guide to Non-Catastrophic Keyword Research Keyword research is one of the first and most basic tasks that SEOs learn.

In this talk, Tom will walk you through the various ways the wrong data can lead you astray, and how to leverage the right techniques for the right tasks. Wil Reynolds Founder & VP of Innovation | Seer Interactive Keyword Research for Thanks Instead of Ranks Seer Interactive has used keyword research methods to uncover ways to help clients understand their customers better.
