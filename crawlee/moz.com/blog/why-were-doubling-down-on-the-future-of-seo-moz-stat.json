  "content": "Why We're Doubling Down on the Future of SEO - Moz + STAT Moz News | Marketing Industry By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers October 11, 2018 Table of Contents Copied! By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers October 11, 2018 Why We're Doubling Down on the Future of SEO - Moz + STAT Moz News | Marketing Industry Search is changing. As a 200-person search marketing software company, this isn't just a pithy intro – it's a daily threat to our survival. Being an organic search marketer can be frustrating when even a search like \"What is SEO?\" returns something like this... ...or this... ...or even this... So, why don't we just give up on search marketing altogether? If I had to pick just one answer, it's this – because search still drives the lion's share of targeted, relevant traffic to business websites (and Google drives the vast majority of that traffic, at least in the US, Canada, Australia, and Western Europe). We have to do everything better The answer isn't to give up – it's to recognize all of this new complexity, study it, and do our jobs better. Earlier this year, for example, we embarked on a study to understand how SERP features impact click-through rates (CTR). It turns out to be a difficult problem, but even the initial insights of the data were useful (and a bit startling). For example, here's the average organic (SERPs with no features) curve from that study... Various studies show the starting point at various places, but the shape itself is consistent and familiar. We know, though, that reducing everything to one average ignores a lot. Here's a dramatic example. Let's compare the organic curve to the curve for SERPs with expanded sitelinks (which are highly correlated with dominant and/or branded intent)... Results with sitelinks in the #1 position have a massive 80% average CTR, with a steep drop to #2. These two curves represent two wildly different animals. Now, let's look at SERPs with Knowledge Cards (AKA \"answer boxes\" – Knowledge Graph entities with no organic link)... The CTR in the #1 organic position drops to almost 1/3 of the organic-only curve, with corresponding drops throughout all positions. Organic opportunity on these SERPs is severely limited. Opportunity isn't disappearing, but it is evolving. We have to do better. This is why Moz has teamed up with STAT, and why we're doubling down on search. We recognize the complexity of SERP analytics in 2018, but we also truly believe that there's real opportunity for those willing to do the hard work and build better tools. Doubling down on RANKINGS It hurts a bit to admit, but there's been more than once in the past couple of years where a client outgrew Moz for rank tracking. When they did, we had one thing to say to those clients: \"We'll miss you, and you should talk to STAT Search Analytics.\" STAT has been a market leader in daily rank tracking, and they take that job very seriously, with true enterprise-scale capabilities and reporting. For the past couple of years, STAT's team has also been a generous source of knowledge, and even as competitors our engineering teams have shared intel on Google's latest changes. As of now, all brakes are off, and we're going to dive deep into each other's brains (figuratively, of course – I only take mad science so far) to find out what each team does best. We're going to work to combine the best of STAT's daily tracking technology with Moz's proprietary metrics (such as Keyword Difficulty) to chart the future of rank tracking. We'll also be working together to redefine what \"ranking\" means, in an organic sense. There are multiple SERP features, from Featured Snippets to Video Carousels to People Also Ask boxes that represent significant organic opportunity. STAT and Moz both have a long history of researching these opportunities and recognize the importance of reflecting them in our products. Doubling down on RESEARCH One area Moz has excelled at, showcased in the launch and evolution of Keyword Explorer, is keyword research. We'll be working hard to put that knowledge to work for STAT customers even as we evolve Moz's own toolsets. We're already doing work to better understand keyword intent and how it impacts keyword research – beyond semantically related keywords, how do you find the best keywords with local intent or targeted at the appropriate part of the sales funnel? In an age of answer engines, how do you find the best questions to target? Together, we hope to answer these questions in our products. In August, we literally doubled our keyword corpus in Keyword Explorer to supercharge your keyword research. You can now tap into suggestions from 160 million keywords across the US, Canada, UK, and Australia. Beyond keywords, Moz and STAT have both been market leaders in original industry research, and we'll be stronger together. We're going to have access to more data and more in-house experts, and we'll be putting that data to work for the search industry. Doubling down on RESULTS Finally, we recognize that SERP analytics are much more than just a number from 1–50. You need to understand how results drive clicks, traffic, and revenue. You need to understand your competitive landscape. You need to understand the entire ecosystem of keywords, links, and on-page SEO, and how those work together. By combining STAT's enterprise-level analytics with Moz's keyword research, link graph, and technical SEO tools (including both Site Crawl and On-demand Crawl), we're going to bring you the tools you need to demonstrate and drive bottom-line results. In the short-term, we're going to be listening and learning from each other, and hopefully from you (both our community and our customers). What's missing in your search marketing workflow today? What data do you love in Moz or STAT that's missing from the other side? How can we help you do your job better? Let us know in the comments.
