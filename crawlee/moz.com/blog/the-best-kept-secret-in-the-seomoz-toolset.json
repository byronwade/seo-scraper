By: Rand Fishkin July 16, 2011 The Best Kept Secret in the SEOmoz Toolset SEO Tools The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I'm embarrassed to say that sometimes, I really don't do a good job of putting SEOmoz's best foot forward. Case-in-point: this past week, our SERPs Analysis Tool, one of the most requested, most exciting and most useful projects we've ever crafted had a new release that now includes social data in the report. Thomas and Evan, two remarkable engineers at Moz, have done some kickass work to make sure this product can scale, handle high load requests and (usually) returns with a full report in under 24 hours (it's been returning in less than 30 minutes for me!). At the fundamental level, every SEO has been in this situation: In trying to understand Google's ranking algorithm for a specific query, we often create hacked-together Excel spreadsheets of data from numerous sources in an attempt to identify a pattern, and hopefully, find the answer to the next question - \"How Can I Get My Site Ranking Here?\" The SERPs Analysis Tool saves hours of time, and pulls metrics that would be incredibly hard to collect in one place. It makes a nice, pretty, interactive interface and it's already part of PRO. But... We've done a horrible thing and buried it in an extremely hard-to-find place. Sorry about that - totally my bad. In the future, we'll get it fixed so that you can run this from right inside your PRO web app (which, let's face it, is where/when most of us actually need it). In the meantime, here's how to access it: Step 1: Run a Keyword Difficulty Report _ Step 2: Use the \"Run Full Report\" Button _ Step 3: Go to the \"Recent Reports\" List Step 4: Look for the \"in progress\" Message to Change to a Link _ Step 5: Get Ready for Awesome _ The individual tabs at the top will scroll you horizontally through the report, and you can export to Excel to do even more crazy cool custom stuff with the data. I hope that, like me, you can save yourself endless hours of metrics collection for individual SERPs using this tool. For a deep dive on an individual set of results, it's the best thing I've found. And, if you have suggestions, let us know! p.s. One thing we're already planning is to switch out Google Buzz Shares for Google +1 count :-) Copied! Back to Top",
