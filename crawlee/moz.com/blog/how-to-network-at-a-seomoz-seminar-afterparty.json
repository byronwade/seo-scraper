J By: Jessica Eballar September 8, 2009 How to Network at an SEOmoz Seminar After-Party SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Audiore is an in-house internet marketer for Bill4Time - a time billing company. Ok, fellow SEOmozzers, this is my very first YouMoz post and I’m pretty nervous about it. It’s just like songwriting where you compose something from your personal perspective and cringe a bit as you put it out there for everyone to see. (And if any of you are even thinking about checking to see if I know what I’m talking about, let’s make it easy for you.) Now, this post is coming from someone who is not much of a socialite butterfly. I admit, I procrastinated 30 minutes before I gathered enough courage to get in the door. Ominous Doors So for all you shy introverts or nervous newbies, I know where you’re coming from. You’re not alone. In Response to Lunch For all you skeptics out there who find that the lunch during the conference is enough, let me dedicate this paragraph to you. Yes, yes, there is a one-hour lunch break and yes, you do some networking then. But it’s only an hour, and people use it to eat, catch up on emails, do quick phone calls, etc. People are more likely to think about what time they need to be back to the conference room. It doesn’t compare to the after-party. If anything, the lunch conversation is to prepare you for the after-party. Hopefully the other person will be there too, and you can start off talking to him/her again to build your confidence to talk to others. Those that leave the seminar when the presentations are done, are leaving the event early. They’re missing out on the part of the event that gives the entire experience life. There’s even a few gems waiting for you. Unlike Your Typical Networking Events We remember all those other networking events. You know what I’m talking about. You’ve been there: you talk while the other person is looking around at other people. It’s either that or they’re merely being polite but utilitarian about it. You exchange cards and then go to the next guy to do it all over again. You wonder if they’ll ever speak to you if you passed by them on the street. It’s almost like those speed-dating scenes you see in the movies. A networking event after an intense seminar is completely different from this. Sure, there will be those that take it like they’re at a typical networking event. And that’s to be expected. Not everyone gets it. But not to worry. They will soon leave you very quickly since that’s what they’re supposed to do in order to “cover the room.” What You Have in Common You’re probably saying to yourself, “I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if I were there. What do I have in common with them?” The answer is: Plenty! And there’s going to be no dating around there, so rest assured - despite what you've been told - we’re strictly professional (of course if it was SEOmoz that brought you two together, it’s only fair to invite Rand & the staff to the wedding). Besides the fact that we’re all into SEO, all of us just got our minds blown from receiving massive amounts of useful information at a rapid speed for several consecutive days. People in this state - when with other people of a similar state - tend to bond quicker. It’s just like college again! Although we all come from different levels and different SEO backgrounds, we were just exposed to the same information. Newbies, you have something intelligent you can discuss with the seasoned SEO-ers! And if there is any residual fear you brought with you when you entered the room, there’s probably liquid courage not too far away. Then What? If immediately coming up to someone isn’t your style, try joining a small group of people listening to a single person (it’s most likely Rand or one of the presenters). You just entered into a little extension of the seminar! It’s a gem that only a few will get. And why shouldn’t you be amongst them? Afterwards, talk to the person next to you. If you were blown away by what the speaker said, say so. If you didn’t understand, voice it out. Maybe even ask the speaker. Chances are, the person you talk to will have his/her own insights to share on the subject. Who Else Can I Talk To? Ok, let’s say you just finished talking with someone from that group, his friend comes along, you give your thanks and then walk around. Who else can you talk to? The presenters are the easiest to start with. They are very approachable and more than happy to impart knowledge. They wished they had more time to elaborate on what was rushed through in their 45 minute set. Try asking them about their SEO beginnings. You’d be surprised. Their answer will make them human. They started out as a newbie, too, once upon a time. A connection will be made and you won’t feel so distant anymore. You might even get out of your shell and let your own personality shine! Some side people you don’t want to miss talking to is the SEOmoz staff. Jen is one of the most approachable people you will ever meet at the party (yes, the more you get into this, the less it feels like a networking event). Her warm personality will get you out of your shell in no time. By the time you’re done talking with her, you’re pretty confident you can talk to anyone else in the room. And then there’s Danny. Remember those string of emails you’ve been exchanging with him over technical difficulties? He brings his MacBook Pro wherever he goes, and he will troubleshoot right there and then. He gives you his 100% attention and if it’s still unresolved, you’ll see him – with your own eyes – put your issue on his \"To Do Right Away\" list. No joke! Pool of Friends My favorite approach is by pool. I like to start with doing what I find enjoyable. It gives me more time with the person and we have fun doing something together. You don’t have to talk all the time, and when you do, it comes naturally. Rest assured, no one will bash you if you’re not that good. Sometimes one of the presenters will step up to play. One of the presenters, Dharmesh Shah from OnStartups.com. They will become even more human and down-to-earth, and you will have more face time with them. Another gem! “But I’m really not that good at pool. Maybe I don’t want to play,” you object. Ok fine, but you can still be a part of it. Be on the sidelines and contribute from there by giving comments to various shots. If one of players did a good shot, let him/her know. Chances are, he/she will appreciate it. Every piece of encouragement helps. The Rewards By the end of the party, you will feel like the knowledge you got from the seminar had some life breathed into it. You just hung out with like-minded people who understand you and your obsession with SEO. Someone once told me, “The best person who appreciates a body-builder is another body-builder.” You’ll also feel inspired to work hard just like the presenters did when they were in your shoes. Maybe someday you’ll find yourself also speaking at a podium sharing what you learned along the way. All in all, you will come back to work knowing you’re a part of something great. You’re included in a group of crazy, creative, hard-working, dedicated SEOers. After the After-Party A moment of courage is rewarded a hundred-fold. With the business cards you earned, write something on each card that describes the conversation you had with them. Email them back with your thanks or follow them on Twitter. I recommend Twitter – you keep in touch with them, quickly exchange thoughts, and continue to build a relationship with them. In the future, they’ll more likely bounce SEO ideas and questions with you. And don’t forget to follow the presenters, too, to continue the stream of gems. If you have pictures from the party, post them and give your new SEO friends a link. Chances are, they’ll reference your post and give a link back. Susan Urban, one of my first SEO mentors, calls this “link love.” Left to Right: Tom Critchlow from Distilled, Adrian Ridner from Remilon, Jen Sable Lopez from SEOmoz, Sam Niccolls from SEOmoz, me from Bill4Time, Fabio Ricotta from MestreSEO, and Cassiano Travareli from BrasilSEO.

Ray Watson from audio123 & me To Sum It Up When you develop a genuine interest in someone or a common interest, it isn’t hard to talk to them. But if self-consciousness gets the best of you, allow me to share: The Little Icebreaker Cheat Sheet • Ask them what fascinated them most in the seminar. Then ask why. Elaborate on it or give your own insights. • Ask what the SEO industry is like from their hometown. • Give your own take on a single subject of the seminar and ask their opinion. • Ask what they did previously and how they got into SEO in the first place. • If watching a game, ask if you can play the next game. • If playing, invite the onlookers to play the next game with you. • After talking for awhile, be the first to ask for their business card. • Offer your sincere gratitude to a presenter that inspired you. Tell how you’re inspired. And if you haven't been hovering over the diamonds, here are the diamonds waiting for you at the next after-party: Bridging the gap between you and those more advanced Extension of seminar presentations Personal SEOmoz Tech Support More face time with the presenters More genuine Twitter friends Fellow SEOers off of whom you can bounce ideas Opportunity to get a link And in a special party like this, you’ll want to bring as many business cards as you can carry. Chances are, you’ll run out by the end of the evening. Copied! Back to Top",
