K By: Kate Morris May 13, 2008 Social Marketing and Web 2.0: It's About Passion Social Media This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. A true question: \"How do you create a community/forum to start? I am in the mortgage business and wondering if I were to start something like that, how I would go about getting people there.\" That prompted a debate about how to get a community going. Buying the community, starting off in other communities and luring people over, making up identities to build conversation. All really good ideas -- based on what industry you are in. But it really came down to one thing. People are going to participate in what they are passionate about. Got a forum on cars? Great! Computers? Sure! An author or series of books? Perfect. Financing? Not so much. Someone make a good point that people only care about mortgages when they are buying a house and that is not all the time. They don't have the time, drive or patience to keep up with it, they just want an answer right now. In the finance world (which I happen to be in as well, but a different side), people don't want to answer other people's questions about finance, they want professionals to answer their questions. What's Your Point? Social Marketing and Web 2.0 ideas are centered around the consumer. You. Yes, you. Are you going to blog about your realtor or buying your car if it went well? Nope. Are you going to tell someone about the awesome iPod Touch you just got? Oh yeah! The bulk of social marketing, blogs, and forums are going to work only if there is a PASSION behind it. It doesn't have to be a physical product like cars or computers, it can be an industry where people really talk (take, say...SEM for instance). But the passion has to be there for it to be big. Does This Mean Social Marketing is a Bust For You? Nope. I am working the financial world right now. Social marketing works for my company but in a different way. I take time every day to answer questions. I search out those people who need help, and I help them. I don't always offer my company's services, but if it's part of the answer, sure! Yahoo! Answers is the perfect place to do that. There are so many more, but that is where I spend my time. Find forums where people ask questions about your product or service and help them. The time will come when someone sees your answer and thinks, \"Hey, they know what they are talking about. Maybe I'll contact them directly.\" Seek and ye shall find. If there is passion, it'll happen. If there isn't, just be there to assist. Karma works where passion is void. Copied! Back to Top",
