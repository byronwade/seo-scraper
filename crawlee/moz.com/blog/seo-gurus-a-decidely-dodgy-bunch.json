By: Rand Fishkin December 6, 2005 SEO Gurus - A Decidely Dodgy Bunch SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Jill Whalen's linking to a good post on her (new?) blog through her signature at HighRankings. I like what she's got to say: Often, when they get their answer, they write back with something like, “But, so-and-so SEO guru wrote this article here at [insert stupid SEO site that prints any article they can get their hands on] which says the opposite of what you just said.” Fine, then listen to them if you prefer. Folks, you need to choose your SEO guru and stick with them. Who do you believe? Who makes sense? Who uses an SEO method that you can live with? Very good points, Jill. I run into the same thing myself and have to turn to evidence to back up my findings. I always try to point out some smart things about the argument against my point, then return with common sense answers to finish it off. I can't blame folks for being skeptical and looking at all sides, though - it's what we tell them to do! Copied! Back to Top",
