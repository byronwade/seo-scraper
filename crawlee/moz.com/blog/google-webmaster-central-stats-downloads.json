By: CarstenC February 8, 2007 Google Webmaster Central Stats Downloads Search Engines This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. If you have a problem with the \"Query Stats for your Site\" feed from Google Webmaster Central, which includes all Keywords with Ranking per Website Sub folder, Google Location (Google.com, Google.de etc.) and Search Type (Web Search, Image Search etc.), here is a tool for you. Have a look at the: Google Query and Link Stats File Conversion Tool The tool breaks records which have multiple keywords stored in a single column and creates a new CSV file for you with one record for each keyword. It also allows you to convert the feed (and all other 6 feeds available at Google Webmaster Central) to another delimited format, if you want to import it into another software application which either does not support CSV or has a problem with the double-quote (\") text qualifier formatting. Some software does have problems with the way text qualifiers work. CSV might stands for \"comma delimited values\", but there is a bit more to it, which is sometimes forgotten by developers. The Tool also provides a simple API for automation purposes. No Web Service, just a basic HTTP interface and straight forward. I hope this will help some folks out there. Please send me comments or suggestions on how to improve the tool and its usability. Thanks, I appreciate that.Cheers!
