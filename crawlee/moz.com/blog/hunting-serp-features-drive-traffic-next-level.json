By: Jo Cameron December 27, 2016 Hunting Down SERP Features to Understand Intent & Drive Traffic - Next Level SEO Basics | Content Marketing | Keyword Research Welcome to the seventh installment of our educational Next Level series! In our last episode, Jo showed us how to better optimize our sites when we think we've done it all (but still aren't ranking). This time around she's giving us the tools and the knowledge to finally capture ourselves a SERP feature. Read on and level up!Are you within striking distance of traffic-bumping SERP features?The content on your freakin' awesome site better be targeting the intent of the searcher. People of the world want different types of content depending on what they search. If you get this right, your content will earn the engagement signals that tell search engines you’re fighting the good fight. The stakes are even higher now. Not only are you battling it out in the organic results, but there are attention-grabbing features that draw clicks away from organic results. But, hey now, chin up! You can use these features to focus on keywords with higher opportunity and win those bobby-dazzlers to drive even more traffic. I’m going to show you how to use the ever-impressive SERP features to check whether you’re targeting intent and whether the entirety of your content satisfies searcher intent, putting you within striking distance of owning some of those queue-jumping features. Follow along in your Moz Pro account or start a free trial, it’ll be fun, trust me. What is searcher intent?Intent is the nuanced language people use to search different things, and it drastically changes what they're really, truly seeking. Every single time a human inputs their heart’s desire into that blank, judgement-free rectangle, they’re asking Google to satisfy their intent. Show me your best “headphone reviews,” your most reliable “sewing machine repairs,” your funniest “cat vs printer gifs,” I command thee! Headphone reviews – I want comparisons, specs, images, first-hand experiences. Maybe I’ll buy something, eventually. Sewing machine repairs – I’m looking for a local business who I can call or visit. Or an instructional article or video. Cat vs printer gifs – Desperately seeking images in the .gif format of a furry friend freaking out over a machine friend. With a few simple clicks on my keyboard, my intention is revealed. As a marketer, if you’re targeting keywords with particular intent, then this needs to be reflected in your content. As a searcher, I haven’t got time to read a long article about cat gifs and printers. I want an array of images to choose from. Likewise, I don’t want to scroll through an image gallery when I’m looking for a service, or an in-depth guide when I’m on the precipice of entering that ever-so-tempting sales funnel. Now let’s look more specifically at the headphone niche. If you sell headphones you might think, “If I can stuff my landing page with a bit of jazzy content and get it in front of every person who searches for ‘headphones’ in every weird and wonderful way, I’m bound to get a chunk of traffic and *bam*, I’ll sell a bunch of headphones.” It doesn’t really work like that. If your content doesn’t satisfy the intent indicated by the searcher, they're likely to head back to search — and you just know Google is paying attention to this behavior. So you could end up sending signals to Google that your content isn’t all that good as it sends your visitors back to search. And because Google wants everyone to find what they’re after, your rankings could take a trip to page-two obscurity. The different types of searcher intentIntent for the purpose of marketing your content can be lumped into three different types that broadly encapsulate what warm bodies are looking for. This is explained in more detail in this post by Tom Anthony. Here is a brief recap that looks at how searches in the headphone niche can fit into vastly different intent types: Informational: what were the first earbud headphones?* Navigational: cnet headphone reviews Transactional: cheap travel headphones * I’m going to go all hipster on you and say it was the stethoscope, which morphed into it’s current shape around the 1850s according to Wiki. Can you see how the implied intent varies depending on the phrasing around the search term? As you research your own target keywords, build up lists, and use those lists to formulate content, the implied intent of the searcher plays an important role in what form your awesome content will take. It also goes hand-in-hand with your journey into long-tail keywords. As the marketers of the world have been paying attention to the implied intent to guide their content creation, so indeed has the biggest website on the planet. The website that reduced internet usage by 40% when it went down for 2 minutes a few years ago. Yeah, you’ve heard of them, right? Well, they're taking a big, old, sloppy bite of the intent pie. In their quest to give the people what they want right in the results pages, Google unleashed The Glorious SERP Feature. What the wicky-wack are SERP features?The fancy-schmancy SERP feature is Google’s way of dazzling users with its more-than-a-result result. It’s Google’s way of saying ‘I hear you’ with its finger guns out, blowing imaginary smoke and reholstering them back into its pockets whilst leaning over the back of your chair, all pleased with itself. Features might pop up all over the results, like this: The one with its paw in the air ready to swat? Argh, too cute. Or they might shuffle into the results, like so: Then again, they may hang out over here, all nonchalant but desperate to please at the same time: With 16 different varieties currently documented, they’re like the chameleon of the SERP kingdom: taking relevant content and reinventing itself like a shapeshifting lizard queen (or Madonna). What SERP features can I win?There are a handful of features you can reasonably have a punt at without throwing cash at Google: Featured Snippets, Related Questions, Image Packs, Site Links, Tweets, Videos, and the News Box. I’m going to focus on Featured Snippets, Related Questions, and Image Packs. The rest of the features are within the reach of larger sites, Google partners, or local businesses. I’m not going to dive into the local aspect in this post, as our Local Learning Center is a good place to start that journey. For regular schmoes like us, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on all 16 features and their presence in the results for keywords you’re tracking. Even if you can’t win them they will elbow out organic results. Featured Snippets: These are like having those fast-track passes at your local theme park. You can jump from somewhere else in the results to position ZERO, and then you’re pretty much owning that SERP. Rob Bucci is my featured snippet guru and you’ll probably join the ranks after watching his talk at Brighton SEO. Related Questions: If you’re tracking Featured Snippets, then you’ll want to familiarize yourself with their buddies, the Related Question. Winning a Related Question will most likely get you a small bump in clicks through to your site; nothing wrong with that. However, the treat you don’t want to miss out on is grabbing those questions and adding them to your tracked keywords in Moz Pro. Often, this will help you sniff out a Featured Snippet you can target. Image Packs: I looove image packs — there aren’t enough ways to display that in text form. I’m very visually motivated and I spend a fair bit of time searching for animated .gifs. If you watch Rob Bucci’s talk then you’ll know that they didn’t tend to find overlap with Featured Snippets. So these are a good opportunity to target the visually minded and increase your chances of getting traffic through features across more keywords. How to use SERP Features to target intentBack in the olden days, like 6 months ago, you would look at keyword modifiers and find transactional terms like ‘buy,’ ‘cheap,’ and so on, then bundle these into the ‘transactional’ pile, and so on and so forth and rinse and repeat. Now, in the bright and shiny land-of-the-future, we can use the presence of particular features to understand the intent as Google sees it. You’re doing two very important things here: lumping your keywords into piles to understand intent that you will use to guide your content, AND identifying features you can win and those that may push you out of the results. Identify the features present for your target keywordsAs with every job there is a manual method and a tool-based method. Manual is totally fine for people with small sites, like a personal blog, and a handful of keywords. I hope that by explaining the basic manual method it will lay the foundation of understanding when we ramp up to the tool-based method. Okey dokey spreadsheet fans, get ready for the keyboard + mouse dance we do when filling up a spreadsheet with lovely data. Start by searching your keywords one-by-one, use incognito mode to avoid personalised results, and add a mark to the sheet next to the features that are present. Here's a sheet with all the features already added to get you started. I even added some gentle colors inspired by the first episode of Black Mirror Season 3. Lacie’s giving it 5 stars. Don’t forget to check out the second tab with your handy-dandy SERP feature cheatsheet. This is a good way to start understanding more about the different SERP features, identify what they look like, where they hang out, and how intrusive they are. Identify and track SERP features with Moz ProGot more than a handful of keywords? Want all this data for your site and your competitors? Want a tool to do the heavy lifting for you? Don’t we all. Did I mention before about the Moz Pro has a 30-day free trial? I’m pretty sure I did, but it was so far up the page and the follow-along-with-me part is starting right now! It will do all the SERP feature hunting, tracking, and cataloguing for you. Moz Pro will identify the presence of all 16 SERP features and will also be able to show you if your site is present in Featured Snippets, Image Packs, In-depth Articles, Local Packs, Reviews, Site Links, and Videos. First off, head to the SERP Features tab under Rankings. You’ll see the percentage of features present for the keywords you’re tracking (in gray), along with the percentage of features your site is present in (in blue). Find out how you are performing against your competitorsUnderneath the Overview chart look for the filter icon, click it and scroll down to choose SERP Features and enter your desired feature. I’m going to start with Image Packs. It’s fairly easy to optimize some image — don’t forget to add informative file names, alt text, and correctly compress your images. This little feature key will help you decipher the results: Blue: Your site is in the feature. Orange: You and one or more of your competitors are in the feature. Red: You are not in the feature, but one or more of your competitors are. Gray: A SERP Feature exists but no one in your campaign is present. Keep an eye out for features your competitor is dominating by clicking the SERP Features header to filter the results. Identify keywords you're on page one for with features that you could winIf you’re on page one for your desired keyword, and there is a Feature Snippet present, then there is a gift there, just waiting for you. Kind of like when you had that Amazon parcel sitting on your front doorstep, getting chewed on by your neighbor's dog and piddled on by their cat and you’re in your house just meters away, blissfully unaware. Become aware by heading to the SERP Features tab and filtering by Featured Snippets. Hit that Rank header until the arrow is pointing up, then scroll down to peruse keywords with Feature Snippets present sorted by your rank. The tooltip Insights indicates I’m within striking distance of owning this snippet. Ronell outlines a strategy for winning and keeping a Featured Snippet. At its heart, it’s about pure laser-focus on intent, find the question, answer said question, add value, and make it accessible to humans and bots. Identify pages that are dropping in the rankings and check that the content matches intentFor this I’m going to head to my Rankings tab, containing all the keywords I’m tracking in my Moz Pro campaign. Double click the little up/down icon header twice to filter all the down-arrow keywords to the top of the pile. I’ve noticed that my rankings have dropped for my coveted keyword ”learn how to moz,” and I want to figure out if there are some SERP features present that could indicate whether my content could be targeting intent better. So I’ll click the keyword to open up the Keyword Analysis. Then scroll down to Your Performance and toggle to SERP Features from the drop-down menu. You’ll see all the different types of features on the left-hand column and when they were present in the results for your keyword indicated by the light gray line. I’m not seeing any Featured Snippets or Image Packs, but lookie here! A Related Question... Remember what we said about Related Questions? Track those beauties down and add the questions to your bundle — you might just find a Featured Snippet hiding out there. So that’s what I’m going to do. I’ll snap up those questions and add them to my Moz Pro campaign. Now the next time my campaign updates I can check for tasty little Featured Snippets to target. Now back to analyzing intent. I’m going to look at that page and see what can be improved to better match the intent as implied by Google. I can see that videos are present, so I’m going to pop a video into my content. It may not show up as a feature on the results page, but I’m responding to what the searchers of the world are seeking, and I’m also thinking this will keep people on the page whilst serving their needs. Repeat, and sort your Tracked Keywords by RankYou can also follow this same process by sorting by Rank to find keywords where you’re on the bottom of the first page or the top of the second page to suss out the intent as indicated by the presence of certain SERP Features. Then zip back up to the last step and repeat the process of analyzing keywords for features to figure out intent and hunt down those tasty features. Wrapping upHere’s a quick recap: SERP features are your insight into what content Google thinks best serves the needs of searchers for any given keyword. You can use the presence of features to quickly understand the implied intent for your target keywords and cross-reference this with a drop in rankings to improve how your content meets the needs of searchers. By combining the feature power of Image Packs, Related Keywords, and Featured Snippets you’ll be covering the most effective organic features and potentially queue-jumping your way to position ZERO. For the organic fanatics, you’ll also be able to track all 16 features and give more love to those with features you can win whilst artfully stepping around keywords with unobtainable features overcrowding the results and pushing your tasty URL into the lost land of page 2.
