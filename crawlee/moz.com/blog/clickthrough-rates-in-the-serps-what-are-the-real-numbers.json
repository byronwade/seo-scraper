Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin August 7, 2007 Click-Through Rates in the SERPs - What Are the Real Numbers? Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Today on SearchEngineLand, I caught this graphic: Despite my great trust in all things Danny Sullivan (yes, I know this technically comes via Elliance), I've got to say that I find this somewhat hard to believe. Do 28% of all searchers really click on results within page 2 or 3? In my experience, the traffic difference from position #1 to position #11 is far more disparate - something closer to 1/100th of the visits. I'd be extremely curious to see truly accurate and industry-wide data on all of the following: Average CTR on positions #1-#40 (at each of the major engines) Average CTR on ad listings vs. organic listings (at each of the major engines) Comparison of visitor behaviors from paid search vs. organic search Comparison of visitor behaviors from top 3 listings vs. bottom 7-30 listings Percentage of CTR on onebox and other vertical-style results Percentage of traffic driven by each of the 4 major search engines (I'm somewhat suspicious of ComScore's numbers - Google lost share at Microsoft's expense?) If anyone has this data, or links that point to valuable sources, please do share. I suspect that my limited experience in a few hundred SERPs is no match for truly robust, industry-wide data. BTW - Loving the vacation. I have my heart set on this place for the wedding, but Mystery Guest remains open-minded.
