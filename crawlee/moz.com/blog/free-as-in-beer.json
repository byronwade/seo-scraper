By: Will Critchlow October 16, 2009 Free as in beer SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. As many of you are now aware, the \"across the bloody pond\" edition of the Pro SEO training that we are hosting in London with the SEOmoz crew is now sold out. What you may not know is that we (Distilled and SEOmoz) are sponsoring a LondonSEO event on Tuesday evening after the end of the seminar. Here's the official write-up from Jane. What does this mean for you? Well, it means that whether you are coming to the seminar or not, if you can get to London you can head for the Crown & Sceptre pub on the corner of Great Titchfield Street and Foley Street on Tuesday evening for free beer, scintillating SEO chat and a chance to hang out with all the cool kids of the London SEO scene (yes, I'll be there as well). We are paying for the beer, so if you can get into central London, you really don't have an excuse. This post is really just a short informational one. Here's the lowdown: when Tuesday 20th October, from 6pm where Crown & Sceptre pub on the corner of Great Titchfield Street and Foley Street how much? FREE! (free entry and free beer) I hope to see many of you there. If you can make it, do introduce yourself. Most of the Distilled guys will be there, as will (I believe) Rand, Ben and Danny from SEOmoz. Short and sweet. I think that'll do for a Friday evening post. Have a good weekend all! Copied! Back to Top",
