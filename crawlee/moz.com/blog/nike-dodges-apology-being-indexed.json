By: Rand Fishkin July 8, 2005 Nike Dodges Apology Being Indexed Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Since 1968, a blog I recently came across, points to Nike's fascinating technique of using a gif image of their apology letter to avoid having it indexed by the major search engines. Some users comment that they believe it to be purely coincidental and that Nike simply doesn't have the technical staff to write HTML, so they used an image instead. Whatever the reason, it's a great technique to dodge public humiliations becoming searchable - sadly for Nike, 1968 published the text of their letter and linked to the image; which somewath defeats the purpose.
