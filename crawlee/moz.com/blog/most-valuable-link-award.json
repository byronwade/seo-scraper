By: Rand Fishkin March 26, 2005 Most Valuable Link Award Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. EGOL from SEOChat asked me to blog on the subject of the \"most valuable link\". The MVL award is something I think I'll blog on monthly and perhaps give a prize at the end of the year.The first thing I had to do was consider criteria: Authority site Tons of traffic Lots of visibility in a web active community (so you get more links after folks see it) Lots of click-throughs to linked content Multi-theme website so it doesn't skew your \"on-topic\" relevance Uses descriptive anchor text and descriptive surrounding text Credible and respected source High PR (just for kicks) Tons of inbound links A whole section of content about just your linkThis narrowed down the choices somewhat, but an obvious candidate was... Slashdot, and thus they receive this month's MVL award. Congratulations /. - you're kickin' it old school and making people wealthy every day, just by linking. Copied! Back to Top",
