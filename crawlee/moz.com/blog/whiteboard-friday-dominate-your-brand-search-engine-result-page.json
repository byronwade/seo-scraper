Use these types of websites to promote what other domains are saying about you or your brand elsewhere on the Internet. This gives those pages (social media profiles, interviews, etc...) link juice and improves their relevancy, thus helping them rank for your brand SERP. (Hint: Use anchor text like \"SEOmoz on Twitter\" or \"John Doe in the New York Times\"). You can see an example of me doing this tactic on DannyDover.com Build an Alternative Brand Site After building your brand hub and linking from its homepage to the other pages you want to rank, you should build another brand site. In practical terms I recommend using a single page on a related domain. (I use this page targeting just my first name, Danny as my alternate). This helps you command a second result in the SERP because it is on a separate (and in this case, a more powerful) domain. Create Social Media Profiles This is obvious. Social media profiles (Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, etc...) are both great search results for people/brand searches and are on very powerful domains. This makes them great resources to fill up your brand SERP. Do Interviews/News Linking to relevant articles/interviews on your brand hub site is an excellent tactic for filling the remaining spots on your brand SERP. Like the last tactic, these pages are helpful search results for searchers and are usually on powerful domains. Do PPC This final tactic is less intuitive. Bidding on your name/brand allows you to control the ads on your brand SERP. This is helpful for branding (der...) and it actually tends to increase the click through rates of the number one result on the page as well as the ad.
