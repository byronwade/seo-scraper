(Actually, this is a Roundup Post) SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. As always, there's all sorts of good stuff in the search world this week: Best response to the Wall Street Journal's odd article on site moves goes to... Lisa Barone - who goes to great depths to really explain the issue. Hey, look at Google, getting involved with German webmasters just before SES Munich. Very nice touch. ComputerWorld magazine did an interesting piece on Google's \"secret sauce\" that featured SEOmoz in a roundabout way. Since ComputerWorld forces an interstitial and breaks up the content, I've linked to the far friendlier article at MacWorld. While I really enjoyed the blogger face off between ProBlogger & ShoeMoney, something about the one between Lee & I just isn't as compelling - can't quite put my finger on it. Wow... The Ask team is right, their new map drawing functionality is amazing. Google, you're making a big fan out of me with this privacy protection announcement (swoon) Man, Brett Tabke's blogged more in the last 10 days than the previous 10 months; very interesting material, too. Why is Reddit my favorite social site? Because... it linked to this on home investments, this on rental cars, this on homework, and this on this on how Marty McFly & Doc Brown were totally right. Tool of the week? Article Checker - similar to Copyscape, but you can pre-check text (a very nice feature). Anything you'd like to share? Copied! Back to Top",
