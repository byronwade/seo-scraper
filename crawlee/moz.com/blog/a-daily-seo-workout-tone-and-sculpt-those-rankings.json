M By: Martin Holland November 24, 2009 A Daily SEO Workout - Tone and Sculpt Those Rankings! Link Building This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Hello and welcome to my daily SEO workout, I'm new to SEO but think you will find my program highly effective, within weeks your SEO will be toned and sculpted to improve search engine posture and MozRank, let's begin; You will hear many trainers tell you that hydration is important but I say; \"Why hydrate when you can caffeinate!\" Make sure you have a strong coffee close by at all times during your SEO workout... 1. Let's Begin With Some Stretching Before beginning any workout it's important to stretch. In our SEO workout we are going to equate stretching or \"increasing flexibility\" to increasing link diversity. The more diverse your inbound link portfolio the better. So let's stretch that portfolio, remember to breath deep (and imbibe some coffee)... One of my favorite ways to increase my link diversity is to sign up for a BloggersChoiceAwards account, nominate one of my own sites, and then find other sites that catch my eye. Once you find a site that you like, vote for them and then visit their blog. Leave a comment such as; \"Hi there, I love your blog about <<insert relevant content here>> and I voted for you, I wondered if you would like to vote for me, I am at <<insert your BloggersChoiceAwards link here>>\" This simple stretching exercise will get you networked in with a whole range of diverse bloggers and it can build some genuine friendships if you follow up on votes etc. The next stage is to work on those friendships and try to gain a blogroll link or a review of your site on theirs! 2. Put in Some Time on the Tread-Mill Cardio exercise is all about endurance and getting your heart rate up, let's think of it as perservering with some of the more tedious SEO tasks combined with a boost in your pulse (That's right people, take another sip of that coffee!) I find the most boring SEO task is advertising, it takes time to correctly sculpt a great advert and it may take several months to get a good idea of how well an advert is performing, but it's worth it! I always look for ways to use PPC adverts which will steadily increase traffic whilst remaining low cost; One way is to create a site widget using a service such as WidgetBox, ClearSpring or Yahoo Widgets and then start a PPC campaign which links to the widget download page. The more the widget is downloaded the higher up the leader board it will climb and your widget will eventually reach a natural search results front page thus generating natural downloads... Widgetized blog content is a great way to generate traffic to your site and boosting your \"blidgets\" number of installs with low cost PPC is a great tactic! 3. Let's Do Some Heavy Lifting! Now that we've stretched and done some good cardio it's time to hit the weights! The heavy lifting of our SEO workout is going to focus on real world networking. For this heavy lifting exercise you will need strength and determination, and some business cards! (Take your coffee and transfer it to a travel mug, you will still need it for the heavy lifting) Your challenge here is to go forth into the real world and interview local businesses or organizations relevant to your own niche... Carry a stash of business cards with your name, email and website and hand them out to your local business of choice asking if they would like to be interviewed for an article on your website. If you operate an SEO website you might ask local businesses for their search engine ranking experiences etc., most local companies are happy to be intereviewed and relish the opportunity to be featured in online articles. Once you have made your \"real world\"contact you can write an article and send them the link. Once your heavy lifting is complete you may just find that the local company you wrote about links back to your article from their website, Twitter, Facebook, Myspace page etc...Hey Presto, lifting those heavy SEO weights has paid off! SAFETY NOTE: When performing some of these heavy lifting exercises don't exercise the same muscle group on consecutive days, or in SEO terms, don't repeat an article more than once! I have tried duplicating the same article putting in different titles and image \"alt\" text to try and leverage multiple key phrases and it doesn't work! In fact the major search engines will likely penalize your content if they find too much duplicated content. I hope you enjoyed my daily SEO workout, please let me know if my routine helps you get that optimized site physique you always wanted and remember; Sweat Equals Opportunity! Copied! Back to Top",
