By: Rand Fishkin April 17, 2007 Help Make Stephen Colbert the \"Greatest Living American\" Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Jonah Stein from Alchemist Media hung out with some writers from the Colbert Report last week and told them about the powers of \"Google-Bombing.\" Naturally, being the fun and mischievous crew that they are, they loved the idea and asked him if he could make Stephen #1 for \"Giant Brass Balls\" - he accepted, but offered them one better... to help make Mr. Colbert Google's top result for the \"Greatest Living American.\" Tough task? Absolutely. However, I think it's possible and I'm happy to spread the meme. If you're a fan of the Colbert Report (and really, if you're not, you probably don't enjoy SEOmoz, kittens, apple pie or sunshine either) and you run a site of any kind, be kind enough to slip it into a few posts or pages over the next few days and you'll have the opportunity to earn a nice reward from SEOmoz. What's that you say? A reward from SEOmoz? Yep. Post a link to your creative use of the link - \"Greatest Living American\" in the comments below and our own Rebecca Kelley (possibly the moz crew's biggest Colbert fan) will be judge and jury and decide which of you will receive 2 (two) months of free premium membership. Even if you're a premium member, we'll tack it onto the end of your year, so there's no excuse for anyone not to participate. The deadline for links is next Monday, April 23rd, so you've even got a weekend to brainstorm. Mr. Colbert purportedly said; \"I don't know what Google-Bombing is, but I want it.\" For eligibility you must: Link to this URL - http://www.colbertnation.com/cn/letter-from-stephen.php - from your page (no link condoms allowed) Use the anchor text \"Greatest Living American\" Link to your page in the comments of this post (no need to write the URL out, you can just use the WYSIWYG link button) Complete all this by Monday, April 23rd Those two free months are worth $80 (Hey Matt, are those paid links?), so get to work and do us proud (and make us laugh, too).
