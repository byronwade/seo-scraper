By: Rand Fishkin March 26, 2011 4 SEO Presentations w/ Tips, Graphics + Data You Can Use Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. NOTE: All of the slide decks in this post are free to download and distribute, as are any of the stats/graphics in them (please reference the source if you do). Hopefully they'll be helpful learning tools and will make your deck-building processes easier than mine have been! The past few weeks have been a whirlwind for me, and they're not slowing down anytime soon. Just 2 weeks ago, I jetted off to San Marino (a small country in the northeastern part of Italy) with my travel blogging wife, Hannah Smith from Distilled, Marcus Tandler + Niels Dorje of TandlerDorje, Gianluca Fiorelli and Google's Avinash Kaushik (along with several great local speakers). Below are two of my presentations from that event (Be-Wizard): The Evolution of Google's Rankings View more presentations from randfish Social Media Marketing for Traffic + SEO View more presentations from randfish From there, I headed to Rome, where, thanks to the US State Department and LUISS University, I gave a talk on entrepreneurship and told the story of SEOmoz, which contains my usual level of oversharing and transparency: The Story of Moz: 1981-2011 View more presentations from randfish In Rome, I also did a video interview with Robin Good of MasterNewMedia on a number of SEO related topics. After our interview, he filmed my presentation of the \"Story of Moz\" deck above, which, depending on quality, may be available sometime in the near future.Next up was London for the awesome Link Building event from Distilled (can't share decks from that, sorry) followed by 2 days at home in Seattle and then a mad dash to Phoenix for Infusioncon (just before Link Building V2 in New Orleans). At InfusionCon, I gave a fairly comprehensive, SEO 101 style talk that was quite well received: 10 Steps to Great SEO: InfusionCon 2011 View more presentations from randfish One thing I've noticed that's very powerful as a marketing/influence tactic for me personally is the sharing of my slidedecks on services like Slideshare. Because I'll often tweet the link to the presentation as I go on stage or just prior, I'm able to give the audience an opportunity to download and follow along. This has several cool effects: The slideshow URL gets tweeted and re-tweeted and seen by thousands more people than just the few hundred usually in the room. Those attendees are often the most active sharers, resulting in a terrific, positive re-inforcement cycle (so long as I do a good job) :-) Having the slideshow seen by so many often means it goes to the frontpage of Slideshare, getting even more exposure. When I spend a dozen or more hours making a slide deck for a presentation to 300 people, it's great to know that there's the potential to get much more exposure via inbound marketing of that content afterward The slideshow pages contain lots of links, which drives visits to many web marketing sites I reference, as well as SEOmoz itself. Those sites who get traffic often send me notes of thanks (when it's I who should be thanking them for making my job easier) and everyone wins as the audience gets valuable links and the sites, Moz included, get high quality, relevant traffic. If you're on the road at events large or small, let me highly recommend this approach. And, hopefully, these slide decks prove useful, too! My next few trips will take me to SMX Munich, where I'll be leaking our first results from the user surveys and correlation data collected for the 2011 version of the Search Engine Ranking Factors. After that, I'm off to SMX Sydney, where I'll be on a number of panels around SEO topics. In late May, we're working to hold an informal, free Moz meetup with Avi Wilensky's ProMediaCorp in New York City (dates/specifics TBD) followed immediately by Distilled's Boston PRO Training seminar and, finally a keynote of SMX France in Paris in early June. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at one of these events! Copied! Back to Top",
