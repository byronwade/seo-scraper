Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 18, 2005 Seattle's Wong Doody needs Web Site Help Mobile SEO I just joined the Ad Club of Seattle in the hopes of meeting some good people I can recruit away from the tradtional ad business into our nefarious circle (insert devious grin icon). As I was checking out u... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 17, 2005 Torture a Spammer Game Blogging Check out the Torture a Spammer Game from MarketingSherpa. It's not blog spammers, but rather e-mail spammers, with whom \"legitimate\" email marketers have a big problem with, apparently. I'm of two minds a... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 17, 2005 Adsense Ads for SEO Online Advertising I got an e-mail this morning from Nana at Technobloggie. I have a sneaky suspicion that it was a mass-email to more than a few bloggers in the search space, but that's OK. She's got a nifty tool that scans a page and retu... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 17, 2005 Admitting I was Wrong Search Engines It's never easy to admit to being dead wrong, but in this instance, it would be doing the SEO community a great disservice not to make my mistakes public. In a thread at SEOChat - More on Term Weight..., I abuse members of the notion that keyword density can be used to calculate the importance of a term or phrase in a given document.... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 14, 2005 Happy Birthday to Us Moz News SEOmoz turned 1 year old today. Our first post, way back on October 14th of last year shows just how far we've come. I'm really happy with the way this site has turned out and I have great things in mind (particularly with relation to the tools) o... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 14, 2005 Investigating the RedZee Search Engine Mobile SEO As much as I like their cool zebra logo, it appears that RedZee.com (link left out on purpose) is using a slew of bad tactics to attempt to gain popularity in the search space. I haven't personally seen referrals from them, yet, but some others have and base... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 14, 2005 Online Sketchbook Moz News Back in the late '90's, I was obsessed with Flash design. I spent countless hours animating text and building organic-styled site designs. I gave up on that a long time ago, when I realized that true designers had something I lacked (namely talent) and that hard work can only take you ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 14, 2005 What a Links Page Should Look Like Link Building The question was asked at HighRankings, but I think it's a great, universal question for site builders. What do visitors want from a links page and what should we, therefore, provide. My personal feeling is that your outbound links should be structured in one of 3 ways: When appropriate, link direct... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 12, 2005 Rand, How do I make Link-Worthy Content? Link Building I get asked this all the time when I'm consulting. It's the mantra of the link hungry and content poor and it's a great question - one that's worthy of being repeated over and over (though it need not always involve my first name). There's no easy answer, but there is a simple way I can show you the kinds of content and let you think up your own way to do it. Thanks to our friends at de...

Blogging If you have several doorway/spam domains that Google has decided to gray out the PR on, can you hurt a site who's rankings and reputation are solid by 301ing those penalized domains to the trusted one? This is the question asked by adamclark at SEW. Ian Mcanerin chimes in with some good advice: ...

It's not nearly as difficult as it sounds and she notes (as Matt Cutts did in his interview by Aaron) that it will quickly make you an on-pag... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 11, 2005 More on the Scraper Sites Blogging I received a lot of private email on the subject of my scraper sites post. I asked some folks and they said that I could share their thoughts anonymously - most are worried about reprisal from Google, though I'm forced to wonder how much the search giant could care about a few grumblers in SEO. \"The...
