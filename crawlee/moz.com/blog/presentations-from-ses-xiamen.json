Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin May 26, 2007 Presentations from SES Xiamen SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. As promised, I'm putting up my presentations from SES Xiamen 2007. There's so much to share about China that it's nearly impossible to put it into a blog post and thus, when I return home, I'll be writing a full article on SEOmoz about my experiences, the Chinese search market and what I ate (abalone, shark fin soup, camel, turtle, duck tongue, scorpions, starfish, jellyfish and many more). My presentations included: Keyword Research (and introduction to the tactics and applications) Link Strategies (a discussion of creating link friendly content to target the Linkerati) Lessons from Spamming (my favorite, where I cover how spam gives us a peek into search ranking factors) China is an extraordinary place, and an extraordinary market opportunity right now. I'm already forming partnerships to help provide SEOmoz's content in Chinese and potential have search marketing experts in China contribute to the SEOmoz site. I'll just leave you with this statistic from Gord Hotchkiss's (go read his blog for his early take on China) presentation on Chinese searcher behavior: United States - 154 million regular Internet Users, representing ~68% of the US population China - 150 million regular Internet Users, representing ~10.5% of the Chinese population The next 10 years here are going to be very exciting.
