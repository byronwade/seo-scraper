By: Mani Karthik February 13, 2008 The Problems Faced by SEOs from the Outsourcing Hub of the World Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I want to introduce you all to a new perspective of outsourcing. So, you thought it's all a flowery business out there, right? You set up a small office in your bedroom, sit in your pajamas, and take orders on Skype from your UK/US partners, not to forget the hefty amounts on Paypal you receive to pay your bills. Well, it's a nice picture but honestly the reality is not anything near to it. First off, let me clarify a few things before we get into the real thing. Outsourcing is happening! And it involves big money. But outsourcing does not end up with a smile all of the time. The client is frustrated and so is the guy on the other part of the world. Yes, let's face it. SEO is like an oasis to all those medical transcription and call centre companies. I'm scared to see all these \"traditional\" outsourcers plunging into SEO outsourcing. A few of them even get into SMM when they even don't know what Digg is! Last day, I had an offer from a medical transcription guy who's looking to buy out an \"SEO expert\" (he used that term). I did not agree to the offer simply because he thinks SEO is the \"next big happening thing.\" While I tried my best to convince him that the search industry is not just about SEO and is growing beyond to SMO and SMM, he wouldn't agree. The point I'm trying to make is that SEOs from India and other parts of the world are branded these days as cheap quality. It has got to do something with the money involved. Many Indian SEOs are ready to agree for a USD $200 link building campaign. So I needn't talk more about it, right? Being an SEO myself from India, I've had instances where I felt that this profession is heading to hell, with all these amateurish guys around. In one of Jane's post the other day on the blog, there was a guy who posted a comment, which kind of cemented my ideas. Have a look. The real picture is that many SEO companies in India are legit. There are excellent talents too, but the problem is that they are branded as \"SEO India.\" My clients do not have any problems whatsoever (or maybe I convince them better). I don't agree to USD $200 link building campaigns or USD $500 one year SEO strategies. It simply will not work for me and end up as a time waster, but unfortunately, there are high school kids on DP forums who are ready to take up this task just because they need some pocket money. SEOs from India (or from any outsourcing part of the world, for that matter) are not necessarily cheap quality. There are really good talents out there who can get the stuff done for a better price, but they are not cheap. And like my Scottish friend (no offense here) believes, there are plenty of black hat, high schoolers out there who've read Aaron Wall's SEO book, are familiar with Digital Point forums, who'd take up an entire project for USD $500. So, with hundreds of amateurs like that, who's going to care about a few good ones? Makes sense, right? Coming back to the topic, the biggest problem faced by SEOs from the outsourcing part of the world is competition from cheap amateurs from their neighborhood. To fight this out, probably employers from the other part of the world should not get their products designed/services done from really cheap vendors. Even though we are all from different geographical locations, SEO services demand a certain level of quality, which should be universal. Support the industry, believe in quality !
