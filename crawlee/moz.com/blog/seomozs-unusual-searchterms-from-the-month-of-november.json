Table of Contents Copied! By: Rebecca Kelley December 21, 2007 SEOmoz's Unusual Search Terms from the Month of November SEO Analytics The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. As a special pre-holiday treat, we decided to share our more long tail search terms from last month (November 2007). Enjoy! How to read minds: 225 searches. Ever wonder how Rand seems to have so many eerily accurate predictions about the future of search engine algorithm changes? Well, so do 225 other people... Titties: 52 searches (thank Lucas for that one) Better than google: 51 searches. Meh, we already knew that SEOmoz was better than Google, sliced bread, and real butter combined (mmmmm, butter and Google sandwich...) How to speak English: 41 searches. Sadly, we only offer a course on \"How to Speak English with the Occasional Injections of Superfluous U's into Words,\" taught by our favo(u)rite Kiwi, Jane. Barry bonds before and after: 22 searches. Sounds like a Jeopardy category waiting to happen... Good questions to ask: 22 searches. If you have to search for this, then you fail as a human being. Mud wrestling: 19 searches. How did they know about our team building exercises? Simpsonized pictures: 18 searches. I only threw this in because I geekily think it's cool that we rank for something Simpsons-related. What is an encyclopedia: 13 searches. Seriously? Seriously?! 20 questions to ask a guy: 10 searches. Um, ask them anything. It's not like Jane Goodall with the apes, for crying out loud. the incredibles: 10 searches. Hooray, we rank for a Pixar film! list of every website: 9 searches. Google returns a page saying \"Displaying one of eleventy billion results.\" 6 searches: ive got a golden ticket. That golden ticket, of course, is *ahemshamelessplug* an SEOmoz Premium Membership! Woo hoo! fastest spider. I'd like to see a sequel search query called \"2 fast 2 spider,\" but that's just me. hot young things. That's right. At SEOmoz we're so damn hot. 4 searches: Good to great Collins: I'd say good Collins is True Colors, but great Collins is Sussudio. Gorgeous website: Why, thank you! I'd say it's not too shabby! Self cannibalization: I bet we taste like spam (zing). Most romantic proposal. Yeah yeah, we know, Rand's romantic mushy mushy all that good stuff. 3 searches: how to freebase coke. Rand, is that how you're able to stay up so late blogging? We may need to stage an intervention... things to do with your spouse. Oh, I don't know, how about converse with them instead of spending all your time in front of a computer? set it and forget it rotisserie. My mom has one of these. When she first got it she made pork roast every weekend. I call that period of my life \"the best ever.\" titties, titties, titties. Once again, thanks, Lucas. what to say to your loved one. Well, \"I love you\" is a start... how is oatmeal made? By grinding up pigeons, of course. Two searches: internet makes people lazy. I'd like to see Google return a one box answer of \"No sh*t, Sherlock.\" pay attention to me. Aw, they think the Internet is people! paris Hilton thumbs. They're probably covered with a mutant strain of gonorrhea. how does google see my site. Through the tiny camera they installed in you the last time you got knocked out at the dentist, silly! I work for google. I bet Adam Lasnik and Matt Cutts searched for this one, with Google returning a one box response of \"Sigh, we know.\" Why Canadians are the best at hockey. Uh, a healthy diet of maple syrup and Tim Horton's? What are titties. Ok, seriously, Lucas... Weird porn thumbs. Apparently, if you have weird thumbs then you are well-equipped for a lucrative career in porn. How to speak the English. The fact that it's \"the English\" makes this search so much better. How big is the world wide web. Oh, I'd say it's about 650 Courics big. Nambla site password: I bet there's a fake retrieval site out there that promises the password and then busts the people who try to obtain it. It's probably run by Chris Hansen (\"Why don't you take a seat...\"). How to read minds for real. The \"for real\" part cracked me up, as if Google only shows the real results to people who are serious about mind reading. Michael martinez hardcore seo. I bet the two people who searched for this term were Michael Martinez and his mom. Names to call your loved one. I don't recommend \"ho bag.\" What if ron paul wins? I wonder how many people were expecting a straight answer from Google (e.g., \"Well, then you're effed, I suppose\"). Rebecca Kelley arrested. Okay, for the record, that old lady deserved it. Hat sex xxx. Not only do these folks want hat sex, but they want it in its raunchiest form (hence the xxx). Things to do when your wife is away. How about hat sex? Underpants gnomes. Step 3: Profit! Naked john Michaels. John Michaels, I'm not sure who you are, but apparently some folks are looking for nude photos of you. Just a heads up. One search: Whats the number to the guy who invented the world wide web? It's 555-are-you-effing-serious. Good questions to ask people in truth or dare. How about \"I dare you to get your ass off the computer and go for a walk outside, for crying out loud.\" Is crack and freebase same thing. Okay, seriously, Rand, I'm going to tell you about this nifty little program. There are 12 \"steps\" too, and I know how much you like lists... Why cliques are skinny. Because being able to see your sternum is all the rage now! I can’t live without you. Aw, thanks! Complete appetizer setup. Crab cakes and prawns of some sort are a definite must. Evil cattle. They'll moo-rder you. Do you consider yourself to be lucky / unlucky? Give an example. It's like this person is signing Google up for a dating site. \"Google, describe your perfect date...\" Words to make up. If you search for a word to make up and find one, isn't that word already made up? Just throw some darts at a poster of the alphabet, for crying out loud. How to break a tedious day. This person has the freakin' INTERNET right at his fingertips, and he performs a search on how to break up a tedious day. Clearly the man does not know what StumbleUpon is. Please stop it. Aw, but I'm almost done! Art with elephant on stilts. This is so absurdly specific that I kind of want one for myself. How much is matt cutts worth. I bet Matt's wife searched for this shortly after that life insurance policy kicked in... Letting employees create their own fun. Ten bucks says that Bruce Clay searched for this. \"Here, Lisa, here's a slinky. You get to play with it for five minutes, and then it's back to work.\" Hammer pants blog. Oh man, I'd so read this. I bet it's 2 legit, 2 legit 2 quit (hey heyyyyyyyyyy). How do people start getting famous. Don't wear underwear. That's a good start. Things you shouldnt do to your girlfriends dad. I'm guessing that asking him for a condom is at the top of the list... Why must people be very careful when using ether. Geez, I'd hate to see this guy's search history (I bet we'll find \"why does fire feel ouchy,\" \"how come I can't breathe underwater,\" and \"gasoline smells good\"). How is it anatomically possible for someone to have super powers? God, I love the Internet. Ten signs that a man is never going to marry you. #1: You have a Cathy comic on your fridge and instead of a blanket, you sleep with 12 cats to keep you warm. Why does someone keep bugging me. Maybe it's because you're on your computer all day, and your roommate needs your rent check, you lazy arse. Opposing views on how anorexia and bulimia are bad for you. I like how this person wants to hear \"opposing\" view, like \"Con: You can die. Pro: You'll fit into those skinny leg jeans!\" How to make him think he cant live without me. The gift of an *ahemshamelessplug* SEOmoz Premium Membership is a good start! It's the gift that keeps on giving! Hopefully you enjoyed a peek at our silly search phrases.
