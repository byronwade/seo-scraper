G By: GoldHat September 26, 2007 Original Link Building for Beautiful-Looking Websites Link Building This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. My Name is Amine and am a professional SEO and link builder from Paris. I love my job and am always looking for original link building ideas and concepts. This is my first contribution to the SEOmoz community. Do you own a beautiful website? If you have a professional, attractive, and unique web design, then you are probably missing about fifty high quality backlinks from web design galleries! When you are accepted into web design galleries, you're also frequently featured on their home pages. Above and beyond this, each one of those galleries will give you a high quality and permanent link (if you deserve it). This is a great source of free advertising for your website: those galleries are visited by web professionals, web design studios, SEO companies, and millions of regular users every month. I have compiled a list of fifty high quality galleries, sorted by popularity and PageRank: PageRank 9 1) http://www.cssvault.com 2) http://www.csszengarden.com PageRank 8 3) http://www.cssdrive.com PageRank 7 4) http://www.coolhomepages.com 5) http://www.webstandardsawards.com 6) http://www.cssbeauty.com 7) http://www.thefwa.com 8) http://www.stylegala.com PageRank 6 9) http://www.lightondark.com 10) http://www.cssmania.com 11) http://www.thebestdesigns.com 12) http://www.cssreboot.com 13) http://www.csscollection.com 14) http://www.screenfluent.com 15) http://www.cssheaven.com 16) http://www.designsnack.com 17) http://www.styleboost.com 18) http://www.cssimport.com 19) http://www.cssremix.com 20) http://www.unmatchedstyle.com 21) http://www.w3csites.com 22) http://www.webcreme.com 23) http://www.csstux.com 24) http://www.csselite.com PageRank 5 25) http://www.cssprincess.com 26) http://www.bestwebgallery.com 27) http://www.csslove.net 28) http://www.fullsingle.com 29) http://www.cssbased.com 30) http://www.dark-i.com 31) http://www.csshazard.com 32) http://www.inspirationking.com 33) http://www.cssliquid.com 34) http://www.designshack.co.uk 35) http://www.css-website.com 36) http://www.csssmoothoperator.com 37) http://www.thehorizontalway.com 38) http://www.css-galleries.com 39) http://www.dailyslurp.com 40) http://www.cssflavor.com 41) http://www.fullsingle.com 42) http://www.cssimpress.com 43) http://www.screenalicious.com 44) http://www.cssclip.com 45) http://www.edustyle.net 46) http://www.css11.com 47) http://www.mostinspired.com PageRank 4 48) http://www.brdcast.net 49) http://csscontainer.com 50) http://www.css-design-yorkshire.com These galleries will only accept truly great web designs: if you don't yet have a beautiful site, maybe it's time for you to invest in a beautiful, attractive, and unique design!
