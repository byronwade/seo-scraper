R By: RobDalton March 13, 2009 SEOmoz Tools ~ The Best Out There SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I am not in the business of SEO, but a lot of my business comes from the Internet so I feel it is good to know SEO. When I first started learning SEO, I would compare mostly page rank and some traffic rankings along with the on-page optimization. Nine times out of ten I could not figure out how Google came up with their ranking for a particular keyword. I spent hours trying to figure out what the main difference was. I then came across WebCEO, which was a great tool. It compared on-page factors along with off-page factors. It would show all the links Google may be counting along with all the links Yahoo! may be counting. I figured this was the best tool I had ever seen. So I ran some comparison reports on certain websites and...... it still did not match up to what Google was showing on its rankings for certain keywords. Then I cam across SEOmoz. I actually was at first interested in it just to read the Q & A's, which by the way are very helpful. Then I started to try out the tools. When I ran comparisons on certain sites, I realized that SEOmoz pretty much matched up to what Google was showing......Hallelujah....the answers to my prayers! If you are just reading through things like I was a few months ago, hopefully I am saving you time by telling you go ahead and get your Pro Membership now. IIf you are a Pro Member, hopefully you agree with me. If you are SEOmoz, I want a cookie for each person that signs up after reading this post. Copied! Back to Top",
