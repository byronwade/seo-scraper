Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Matt Cutts brought up an interesting point about the Google Terms of Service. Basically that scraping them is against their Terms of Service. Most websites these days have some type of TOS but I've never heard of one actually being enforced. I know that if you're being a good guy and all you'd probably follow the TOS. I've always looked at the TOS as a request - not as a legal document. Your comments? G-Man Edit: Here's an interesting snippet from the Google TOS: You may not use the Google Services to sell a product or service, or to increase traffic to your Web site for commercial reasons, such as advertising sales. I wonder how many are breaking that bit :) Copied! Back to Top",
