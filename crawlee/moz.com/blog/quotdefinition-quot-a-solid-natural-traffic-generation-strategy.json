E By: Eric Bryant September 22, 2008 \"Define:\" - A Solid Natural Traffic Generation Strategy SEO Analytics This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Watching my traffic stats lately, I've noticed something quite interesting. One page on my domain is receiving significantly more traffic than the others. It took me a while to figure out why. Where was this extra traffic was coming from? Finally, I figured it out. The page in question is http://gnosisarts.com/nj-philosophical-practitioner As you can see, the page is mainly a concise, very specialized, and very simple little dictionary of philosophy and psychology terms. It's very basic: a bulleted list of terms, in alphabetical order, with their definitions. Underneath the definitions are some keyword-specific links to another page which provides brief definitions. What I found is that a not-insignificant number of web searchers are utilizing the \"define: ______\" syntax in routine searches. Some of these searches which are bringing traffic to my site include: \"define: existentialism\" 'define: existential\" \"define: psychotherapy\" Other similar words and phrases have also been sending traffic. It appears that dictionary-styled pages bring targeted, relevant traffic, and they do so without much work or development, to boot. Of course, I didn't plan that particular page to be a traffic generator, merely to be a resource to other philosophical practitioners like myself. But this page taught me a valuable lessons in natural tragffic generation strategy. It just goes to show that you never can be 100% certain where your traffic will come from or which pages will be considered the \"strongest\" on the domain. Copied! Back to Top",
