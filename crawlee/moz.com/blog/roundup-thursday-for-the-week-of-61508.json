By: Rebecca Kelley June 19, 2008 Roundup Thursday for the Week of 6/15/08 SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Stories, news, and other notable items from the past week: Three star links: Our buddy Jeffrey Rohrs is touring the country doing ExactTarget eMarketing seminars. He's coming to our backyard of Seattle next week (June 24), so if you're interested in attending, you can receive $20 off the $99 registration fee by entering the following code at checkout: R1T1JKR1 Over at Techipedia, Samir Balwani guest blogged about Plutter Kite, the \"official roadmap for the best micro-blogging platform.\" He goes through Plurk, Twitter, and Brite Kite's services and features, and it's a handy drilldown of each site's offerings. Speaking of Plurk and Samir, over at Leftthebox.com he brings us 5 reasons why we should be using Plurk. I actually am using Plurk, and I kind of like it. (I'm still the last marketer alive who's not on Twitter.) Our CTO Jeff showed me this list of top 10 home cooking mistakes. You trying to hint at something, Jeff? I told you, it's not my fault the chicken was undercooked--it's your girlfriend's fault for having a weak stomach! ;) The Yahoo! Search Marketing Blog offers up 5 steps to ensure you're bidding for the right place when working on your paid listings campaigns. #1 used to be \"If you're on Google, you're in the wrong place,\" but I think that's changed after the partnership. :) Um, Japan's latest booming sex niche is old people porn. I'm not kidding. (The link goes to a Time.com article, so don't worry about seeing any wrinkly boobies or anything.) Four star links: The Web Hosting Database compiled a list of 100 webmaster blogs by and for women. I was fortunate to make the list along with many other excellent women in our industry. It's a great resource and a fantastic way to discover new blogs. Frequent SEOmoz member Richard Baxter wrote a useful recruitment SEO guide. In his words, his \"Guide to Recruitment SEO is aimed at the beginner to intermediate SEO consultant or in house marketers tasked with buying a new recruitment website from a web design agency.\" ViperChill came out with the Definitive Guide to Fark and Getting Mass Traffic. I love seeing posts that highlight how to leverage less popular social media/web 2.0 sites. Fark is a great site, and it's cool to see ways in which you can try and get a link or a mention from them. Chris Winfield built a presentation exclusively via Twitter. What better way to show how Twitter works and highlight its benefits than by using it to craft your entire presentation? Clever work, Chris. Five star links: David Mihm's Local Search Ranking Factors is an invaluable resource for anyone doing local and small business SEO. Much like our Search Engine Ranking Factors, David's guide pings 20 local search experts on various local search ranking factors and has them weigh in on whether they feel these factors have much of an impact in rankings. I highly recommend checking it out--a lot of time and effort went into this guide, and it's a great reference for anyone looking to optimize for local search.
