Table of Contents Copied! By: Rebecca Kelley October 20, 2006 London (and Worthing) Calling Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I'm pleased and excited to inform you all that Rand is sending me to England for 18 days to participate in Ammon Johns' SEO Intern Training Program. I'll be leaving October 31st and will arrive in London on November 1st. After five days of sightseeing (including celebrating Bonfire Night on November 5th), I'll hop on a train to Worthing, where my training montage (mon-tage!) with Ammon will begin. According to the training's description on Fresh Egg, I'll be learning: Search psychology Site analysis Effective meta data Copy and content Link strategy SEM business and account management Project immersion Expect blogging from England and an article detailing my experience with Ammon. I'll also most likely take a train over to Chitterne during the weekend and say howdy to our favorite SEO guru. Alas, since I'll be busy snatching marbles out of Ammon's outstretched hand and tracking search engine spiders while blindfolded and balancing buckets of water on my shoulders, I'll be missing PubCon in Vegas. If you're at PubCon, please buy a beer for Rand (you'll get 5 points!), Jeff, or Jane in my absence :) Copied! Back to Top",
