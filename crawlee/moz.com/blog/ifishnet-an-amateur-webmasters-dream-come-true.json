By: Rand Fishkin December 18, 2005 Ifish.net - An Amateur Webmaster's Dream Come True Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I got an email from Jen, who runs Ifish.net, a community fishing website that's got a lot of great things going for it, including a loyal visitor base of almost 100,000 (she's got logs here). Jen was looking for advice on where to take her business, and I directed her to cre8, where she's opened a thread seeking help. If you've got some good suggestions for her site, please drop by (or leave them here). Jen's done remarkable work with her community, despite being limited recently by illness. Ifish is a great web success story, and a good example of how a niche site, even without professional help, can succeed in a big way (just for example, note Jen's unique use of a \"fishing life blog\").
