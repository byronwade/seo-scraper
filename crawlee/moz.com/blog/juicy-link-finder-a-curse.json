A By: ASchalk July 23, 2007 I'm Drunk from the Juicy Link Finder SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. As the sole project manager, optimizer, and developer for a small liberal arts university, my time is stretched thin across many people and duties. Update this. Post that. Better everything. Increase whatnot. And then Matt brainstorms and Rand blogs. *Juicy Links enters the scene* My time is now consumed with this amazing tool. Not only does this help me find what I didn't have time to find before, but it's also letting me find things I didn't know exists regarding my school. Recently my school changed names. With name changes comes domain changes. And in the world of .EDUs, all efforts to let Google and Yahoo know that things are changing fail. I know what you're thinking, \"Just set a redirect for that domain.\" Schools are only allowed to maintain one .EDU and keep their old one for 1 year after getting a new one. Enter Juicy Links. I'm finding directories that have information about my school, but the wrong name and the wrong URL. In the last two days, I have sent over 50 emails and online forms requesting changes, updates, additions, or both. Amazing. Quality links do make the site. Thank you, Matt! *note from Rebecca* I published this post just to give Matt warm fuzzies. :) Copied! Back to Top",
