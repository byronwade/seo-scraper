Table of Contents Copied! By: Stephanie Wallace Edited By: Emilie Martin January 24, 2024 Breaking News: ‘PR Critical to SEO Success’ Is Not Breaking News Public Relations | Content Marketing The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Most SEOs would agree an integrated approach to public relations (PR), and SEO is the best way to effectively reach audiences and make authentic connections. When we think about off-page efforts in particular, bolstering a site’s credibility and visibility requires securing organic, relevant mentions from other credible sites. And isn't that the crux of E-E-A-T? Isn’t that earned media? Isn’t that essentially PR? If converged media is the goal, then we need to break down silos and rethink how we draw lines between owned and earned media – between SEO, PR, content, and social. We need to avoid dividing our teams’ efforts and instead optimize the overlaps that will inevitably occur. Using the principles of PR and a human-centered approach, we can improve SEO success. Show the human side: Link building vs. PR storytelling As we know, the goal of link building is to secure organic, relevant mentions from credible websites and ultimately grow organic traffic. The goal of PR is to secure media coverage via compelling stories that resonate with audiences. This creates a mutually beneficial relationship while empowering people to learn more and easily find more information. And when done well, these tactics share a very important common thread: the power of narrative. Embedding PR storytelling into link building efforts – and your social presence – can make content more shareable, engaging, and authoritative. To get started, ask yourself: What’s the story? Why should people care? What value do they get from it?Which websites and channels would have the most significant impact for my audience – not just the highest Domain Authority?How can I tailor each pitch with unique angles? What other ways can I meet my audience where they’re at? It seems like a no-brainer – but this approach is consistently lost in our digital-first culture, especially when it comes to link building. Much like in public relations, SEOs are not pitching machines – we are storytellers. In order to gain valuable, relevant, and authentic links, we can’t approach off-page SEO purely as generating links for the sake of more links. The more unique and original the story, the more likely people will care and the more likely we are to generate links. But sharing interesting and authentic stories is only the first step. Matching content & channel for impact Most people don’t view the world through earned, owned, or paid; SEO vs. PR vs. Social. As marketers, we bucketize these things based on arbitrary factors. We define what is “in our lane” as SEOs and decide how or where to promote content or generate links based on that narrow definition. However, in today’s multimodal, omnichannel world, we have to throw away that old way of thinking. Here’s how you do it: 1. Choose the right story To be successful in using a PR approach to SEO, we have to change our approach to optimizing for consumer discovery across all channels. Social included. It’s not about being everywhere all at once. It’s about being in the right place, at the right time, in the right way, and solving the right problem. Even if that “place” or “solution” is not considered a part of traditional SEO. We can approach content through the lens of optimizing for discovery regardless of the channel or platform. To ensure our content aligns with the target, ask: What’s the right story and message for this specific outlet? How does my audience differ for this channel?How will that experience come to life? How will that experience differ from channel to channel? How can we optimize for each distinct channel? 2. Create custom content Beyond tailoring messaging for each channel, we need to customize the format and style of our content to align with the specific characteristics and expectations of each platform. A long-form narrative may work great for particular opportunities but may not be able to be repurposed on other social platforms such as X or YouTube. Creating custom content for the unique needs of each channel not only demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the characteristics of each outlet but also of your target audience. Consider what kind of content performs well on each channel and the specific requirements for each (e.g., character limits, video lengths, etc.). People consume content and media differently across the web, and we must recognize that. There is not a “one-size-fits-all” solution. Create custom content across channels to improve engagement by: Adapting content length and format: Adjust the length and format of your content based on the platform. Social channels may require concise messages, while guest posts or platforms like LinkedIn can accommodate longer-form content. You may also need to use different types of content, such as videos, infographics, or images. Leveraging visuals appropriately: Tailor visual elements to suit the platform. Instagram and Pinterest, for example, are highly visual and require eye-catching images, while LinkedIn may call for professional graphics or infographics. Adding value and infusing character: Elevate your business into a brand with insights and opinions unique to you. Invite your audience to contribute to the conversation by asking for responses, feedback, and comments. Prioritize encouraging audience engagement in a way that is appropriate for the platform. 3. Optimize accordingly Effective communication hinges on choosing the right channel for our message, and often, that extends beyond traditional search. The very definition of search has changed. TikTok and Instagram are some of the biggest search engines after Google. Consumers use Amazon as a one-stop shop and YouTube as a university. The ebb and flow of social platforms is enough to make your head spin. People don’t passively consume media anymore; they actively seek what they want. PR specialists excel at identifying the most suitable platforms or outlets to connect with their target audience. SEO professionals can harness these strategies to ensure that our content also reaches the right people at the right time. We have to be where our target audience is, nurturing engagement at each touchpoint rather than over-indexing on the bottom of the funnel. Think outside the standard principles of SEO to enhance Brand AuthorityTM and credibility across channels: Traditional PR: PR efforts, such as press releases, guest contributions, and expert interviews, can lead to mentions and links on authoritative websites, increasing the credibility of a brand across diverse verticals. Utilize thought leaders in the space and ensure that links and social promotions are included as part of every partnership.Social promotion: Think beyond a standard press release or an industry directory. How does this story translate to social media specifically? We can optimize social posts for the unique ranking factors of each different social platform. It is widely accepted that social links don't directly influence SEO rankings; however, actively sharing content on social media builds brand strength (more on that to come!), social proof, and furthers a brand’s position as an authority in the industry.Influencer partnerships: Much like traditional social promotion, the right influencer partnership can increase brand awareness and create a sense of trust. Identify stories that can be leveraged via relevant influencers in your industry. What are your potential influencer's audience demographics? What calls to action may make sense? Most importantly, is it worth investing in influencer marketing? Newsjacking: This tactic wherein content is produced that leverages trending topics or breaking news can be a tricky one to pull off, but the results are worth it. By keeping a pulse on news, you can determine if there are relevant trending stories that tie into your defined brand stories. This can support SEO by reaching a wider audience, leading to valuable links and credibility. However, this tactic relies on the ability to produce expert opinions and high-quality content in a timely manner. For newsjacking to truly be successful, it requires a thorough understanding of breaking information and the ability to get strong content out quickly. Growing credibility based on data Whatever the story we are sharing, we need to ensure we create credibility around those relevant topics if we are to gain PR coverage or links. Ask what qualifies you to speak on the matter. Anyone can write about SEO and social, PR, or purple hippos in Peru… but should everyone? To build credibility, it’s imperative to begin with quality stories that you are an expert on. Topics that people want, that solve a problem, or answer questions. Content that people will ultimately want to share. We have to tap into the needs of our audience and create content that builds an authentic connection. As always, it all comes down to knowing your audience, and as SEOs, we have ample data at our fingertips: Past content efforts: Consider PR stories that have performed well, or past content that was successful in link building and driving traffic. Is there anything there that is worth refreshing or expanding upon? Content gaps: Identify content gaps in the industry and among competitors. You can use the Moz Pro Competitive Research tool to compare your domain against competitors to pinpoint gaps and opportunities. Consider what people are searching for that shows a lack of quality answers. What common questions do you get that don’t have answers readily available? Search trends: Leverage Google Trends and tools such as Answer the Public or Exploding Topics to identify new and trending stories that are relevant. Subscribe to HARO newsletters to gain direct insight into what journalists are looking for. What are people searching for today? Search Console data: Use landing page data combined with Search Console queries to identify the topics people already find you for. What opportunities lie in this data? Referral data: Analyze existing top referring websites via analytics tools. Are there specific types of websites that drive significant traffic? Are there any surprises that represent potential opportunities? Previous link building: Evaluate what link acquisition targets have been successful in the past. Are there specific verticals, outlets, or industry organizations that make sense to target with a tailored pitch? With each step towards building credibility, ask yourself: “How does this promote the principles of E-E-A-T?” Does this research or data set lead to a strategy that furthers our perceived Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, or Trustworthiness? Think beyond the link with brand management I promised we’d get here – brand management is the principle that overlays everything we have discussed thus far. While links are undoubtedly important, off-page SEO isn't just about the link. We know branding and PR are inextricably linked, but the same can be said for branding and SEO. We can (and should) apply PR strategies for effective brand management to ensure E-E-A-T signals are strong. Everything from a company’s Google Business Profile and knowledge panels to social profiles and reviews matters. These areas represent an excellent opportunity to highlight brand authority, display information that users find valuable or important, and even drive interactions with the brand. The core elements of SEO that most directly impact brand management at scale include: Consistent branding: Ensure your brand's messaging and tone are consistent across all communication channels, from press releases to social media posts. Make sure that your brand's name, logo, and visual elements are consistently used across your website, social media profiles, and any other online assets. Audit your knowledge panels across Google and Bing. Upload photos and videos where possible. Answer user questions through Q&A features like that in Google to control the narrative. All this consistency reinforces your brand's identity.Reputation management: Monitor online reviews, mentions, and discussions about your brand. Respond to reviews, both positive and negative, to show your commitment to customer satisfaction. How you respond to negative reviews is arguably more important to new customers than how you respond to a glowing review.Social presence: Actively manage your brand's social media profiles by sharing engaging content, interacting with followers, and addressing customer inquiries. Consistent and meaningful interaction with your audience can improve your brand's visibility in search results.Local SEO: For businesses with physical locations, managing your brand's presence on local directories, review sites, and maps is crucial. Accurate and consistent business information (Name, Address, Phone number) is vital for local SEO and brand consistency.Employee advocacy: Encourage employees to be brand advocates online. Encourage thought leadership across your team. Create content that employees can easily access and share, making it easy for them to post on social. Promote a diverse range of employees to be advocates, representing different roles and perspectives within the company. Their positive experiences and testimonials can enhance your brand's credibility. Beyond the checklist of where brand management is important, we must prioritize clarity and consistency. What a brand is and stands for should be very clear to your target audience, and it should permeate your online presence. And as long as you are sticking to the defined stories, this should be easy. Aligning your SEO efforts with PR and social strategies allows you to maintain a consistent brand identity across digital channels and beyond. The result? A stronger, more recognizable brand that stands out in the crowded digital landscape. Bridging the gap between SEO & PR (and social) As mentioned above, in a world where converged media is the ultimate objective, breaking down silos and reimagining the distinctions between owned and earned media, between SEO, PR, and social, is the key to success. Instead of segregating team efforts, we should embrace and optimize the inevitable overlaps between these areas. The intertwining of PR and SEO is not groundbreaking news; it's an established strategy for success in the digital age. The commonality between all of these tactics is simple: we need to treat people like people, regardless of the type of marketing, regardless of whether they’re consumers, journalists, or peers. An integrated approach to storytelling fosters authenticity, which leads to greater visibility, credibility, and, ultimately, success. Copied! Back to Top",
