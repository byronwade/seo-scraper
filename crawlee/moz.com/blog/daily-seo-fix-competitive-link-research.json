Link Gap Analysis: Link Intersect Link gap analysis is a popular tactic amongst SEOs. It involves comparing your own link profile to that of your competitors, and finding the gaps that exist.

Discover Linking Domains with SERP Analysis In the Moz Pro Keyword Research tool, there is a functionality where you can search a keyword, and the top ranking pages for that keyword will show. But, there is so much more to this function. In this video, Varad will show you those ranking pages, as well as the domains that are linking to that particular page. Get ready to soar from there! Use Page Optimization to Find Content Suggestions Moz’s Page Optimization tool is primarily used to see what improvements may need to be made to a page, as well as keyword placement on a page. When you dive a bit deeper into this particular tool, you’ll find that Moz offers content suggestions to you, including URLs that are ranking for the keyword you first queried. Identifying these top ranking URLs is a great way to see what kind of content you should also be creating. In this video, Rachel will show you what you can do with this new found information and how it can help your link research. Find Backlinks to Competitor’s Broken Pages Analyzing the backlinks on a competitor’s broken page is another tactic that SEOs are using, that you may not have been aware of. There are hidden opportunities within these broken pages that are just waiting to be discovered. In this video, Arian will show you exactly how you can find those broken pages within Moz Pro’s Link Research tool. Discovered & Lost Backlinks Another gem within the Moz Pro Link Research tools is the ‘Discovered & Lost’ section. This section will show you all of the new backlinks that Moz has found linking to your competitor in the last 60 days, as well as backlinks that have been lost. This can be insightful information when working on your own backlink building. In this video, Eoin shows you how you can use this functionality to up your Link Research game.
