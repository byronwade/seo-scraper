Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin August 3, 2006 Levels of Search Marketing Knowledge Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I'm stealing this idea straight from these four guys (1, 2, 3 - and 4 - thanks Emil) and adapting it to the world of SEO/M. Here's my take on what the various levels of knowledge are in the search microcosm - I've tried to provide examples as well: Level 1: ConfusedNew website owners or developers who think to themselves... \"Hey, don't I need meta tags to get Google to like me? And maybe I should buy that $19.99 submission service to the top 40 search engines - after all, if it ranks #1 at Google, it must be the best advice around!\" fit this category quite well. Level 2: LearningThese are the folks you see attending their first SES show, posting and reading at the SEO forums and generally taking a deeper stab at the world of search marketing. Some of these people have even bought AdWords or Yahoo! Search Marketing ads, but haven't played with it much. Level 3: NoviceIf you've read the beginner's guide, you're automatically at this level (maybe even level 4 if you paid close attention). These people know basics like clean URLs, internal linking and title tags are critical to rankings. They also have a basic understanding that links influence rank, though they may still be stuck on PageRank in the toolbar as a metric. Level 4: SEO NewbieAt level 4, you gain the title of \"SEO\" - you know why the meta description tag matters, why some links are better than others and how to create a search-friendly site from the ground up. You may even have a few tricks up your sleeve and have some deeper knowledge about a particular niche - where the good links come from, why certain sites rank where they do, etc. Level 5: SEO ProfessionalAt level 5, you know enough to provide professional help to others. 301 re-directs are a new best friend and you've done link building work to a degree that makes you competent in nearly any niche. Keyword research is now a basic task and fixing up search-unfriendly features like select boxes and multiple URL parameters is old hat. Level 6: Master SEOSixes are in a unique club. Chances are that to have this much knowledge, you read 10-20 SEO blogs each day. You're so plugged in to the search world that you've got a fair idea of what Google's last update affected in the algo and what types of spam are still effective at each engine. You're a whiz at diagnosing penalties, finding solutions to difficult search problems and quickly dominating the SERPs in less competitive sectors. Level 7: Dark Lord of SearchI would assign this level to a select few in the world of SEO. At this level, you're often someone who's well-known in the SEO community - you might run a blog or simply be a \"big time\" name in the field, regularly speaking at conferences and getting pegged by Fortune 500 brands to provide insight. These guys & gals know exactly where to place links or create pages to help overrun a negative piece of press and have the connections to make nearly any type of campaign possible, assuming the motivation & money exists. Level 8: Johns, Naylor, Boser & BallieI've only met four people I'd put at level 8 - Ammon Johns, Dave Naylor, Greg Boser & Jake Baillie. These guys know not only search, but coding, marketing & business like the back of their hand. Show them a problem and they'll come up with a solution that solves ten issues you didn't even know you had. Show them a sector and chances are they've optimized at least a few sites to top rankings in it (assuming it's profitable). From spam to technical analysis to scraping, re-direction, content strategies and analytics, they are nothing less than the very best our field has to offer. So, where do you rank yourself? p.s. I would say that a ranking chart like this isn't as relevant in our field as in others, as great levels of specialization in a particular sector must be weighed against the brilliant generalists, but it makes for a fun post, eh? p.p.s. Had to amend this post to add DaveN - not sure how I could have forgot about him, as he's clearly a level 8. BTW - There may be many more folks who are Level 8, but I haven't personally gotten to witness it in action - my list is not meant to be comprehensive, or exclusive, just based on my own personal experiences.
