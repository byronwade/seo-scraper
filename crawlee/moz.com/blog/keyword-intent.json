By: Jo Cameron Edited By: Melissa Rae Brown October 9, 2024 What Is Keyword Intent and How Does It Impact Your Conversion Rate? Keyword Research | On-page SEO | Content Marketing What is keyword intent? Keyword intent, also known as search intent or user intent, is the goal behind a person’s search query. When people enter a search term into Google, they typically want to learn something, make a purchase, compare options, or find a specific location. Understanding this intent helps marketers tailor content to match user expectations, enhancing chances of higher rankings and increased engagement. For instance, someone searching “how to fix a leaky faucet” is likely looking for DIY tips, whereas “plumber near me” suggests they want to hire a professional. Why is keyword intent important for SEO? Google aims to provide users with the best results to keep them engaged and satisfied. Aligning your content with keyword intent boosts your chances of reaching the right audience. Identifying intent during content planning ensures you address your audience’s questions and needs, leading to higher-quality traffic and better conversion rates.To do this effectively, identify keyword intent during the content ideation stage. This approach ensures you're answering the right questions and meeting searchers' needs, as identified by Google, which can lead to higher-quality traffic and better conversion rates for your site. The 4 types of keyword intent There are four primary types of keyword intent: informational, commercial, transactional, and navigational.Informational keyword intent Users with informational intent are looking for knowledge or answers. They might search for how-to guides, explanations, or details on specific topics. Tailoring content to this intent helps establish your site as a trusted information source.Examples of informational keyword intent include:“How does a wind turbine generate electricity?” – The searcher seeks an explanation of wind turbines.“What are the benefits of an air purifier?” – The searcher wants to understand air purifiers’ advantages.“Where can I find the exhaust on a car?” – The searcher needs a guide for locating their car’s exhaust.Informational keyword modifiers may look like:how to use a standing deskwhat is cloud storagebenefits of drinking green teaguide to setting up a home office They often include “how to” and” what is,” indicating that the searcher wants to learn or know something. Impactful content at this stage can help grow awareness and build trust, such as:How-to guides: Detailed step-by-step instructions or tutorialsBlog posts: Educational content that answers \"what\" and \"how\" questionsFAQs: Answers to common questions about a product or topicInfographics: Visual explanations of complex concepts or processesCommercial keyword intent With commercial keyword intent, the searcher is researching products or services to inform a future purchase decision. These searchers are typically looking for information that helps them compare options, evaluate features, and read reviews to guide their buying choices. Understanding commercial intent allows you to create targeted content and resources that address potential buyers' needs and concerns, positioning their offerings as favorable choices in the decision-making process.Examples of commercial keyword intent include:“Best wireless headphones under $100” – The user is comparing affordable wireless headphones.“Comparing electric vs. gas ovens” – The user is evaluating oven types for a purchase.“Best travel credit cards with no foreign transaction fees” – The user seeks recommendations for travel credit cards.Commercial keyword modifiers may include:best noise-canceling headphonesiPhone 15 reviewscompare fitness trackerstop CRM software for small businesses They often include “best” or “compare,” indicating the searcher is close to making a buying decision.Content that guides your audience towards a buying decision at this stage could include:Product comparisons: Compare features and benefits of different productsReviews and testimonials: User reviews or expert opinions on productsCase studies: Real-world examples showing success with a product or serviceProduct feature guides: Detailed breakdowns of product features and benefitsTransactional keyword intent Transactional intent indicates readiness to make a purchase or complete a transaction. These queries are characterized by terms indicating a clear intention to buy, subscribe, book, or otherwise engage in a transaction. Recognizing transactional intent helps businesses optimize their content and offers to meet users’ immediate needs.Examples of transactional keyword intent include: “Buy organic green tea online” – The searcher wants to purchase green tea online.“Schedule a dental cleaning appointment” – The searcher is ready to book a dental appointment.“Order custom wedding invitations” – The searcher wants to order personalized wedding invitations.Transactional keyword modifiers sometimes look like:buy wireless earbuds onlineelectric scooter rentalmoz tool couponair fryers on sale Now we’re talking conversion content. This content is an art form within itself. You’ll have more impactful results if you explore creating: Product pages: Information about the product with a clear call-to-action to buySpecial offers and discounts: Promotions, coupons, or sales pagesCheckout pages: Optimized, easy-to-use purchase pagesFree trial sign-up pages: Offer users a trial or demoNavigational keyword intentNavigational keyword intent is when searchers are looking to reach a specific location, website, or web page rather than seeking general information or making a purchase. This type of search is driven by a clear goal: finding a particular site or page, such as a login portal, customer support page, or a brand’s homepage. Understanding navigational intent helps you optimize your site structure and improve your visibility in search results for users who are directly seeking you out.Examples of navigational keyword intent include:“Moz keyword explorer” – The user wants to navigate to the Moz Keyword Explorer tool.“Spotify Wrapped” – The user wants to access their Spotify Wrapped playlist.“Apple Store NYC” – The user is looking for a specific Apple Store location in NYC. Navigational keyword modifiers sometimes look like:Netflix login pageFacebook account settingsnearest Starbucks locationApple support contact numberYour loyal audience is seeking you out! Improve their experience with pages that are easy to use so they can return time and again.

These will serve as the foundation for your keyword research.Get inspiration from the SERPsUse tools like Google’s “People also ask” and related searches to discover additional keyword ideas. These suggestions reflect common queries related to your core keywords. Keep location & language in mindIf you're tracking globally, word choice matters. For instance, in the UK, you push a “pram,” not a “stroller,” and wear a “jumper,” not a “sweater.” It’s important to make sure your keywords reflect the language of the regions you’re targeting.With the MozBar browser extension, you can set up local profiles to see search results just like someone in a different location would. Just enter the country, region, and name your profile, and you can switch between profiles anytime and get a local view of search results.Add your intent modifiersNow, it’s time to get into keyword intent. Intent modifiers vary, and what works for one business might not work for another. Here’s a loose guideline to help you structure and classify intent in a way that makes sense for your goals.Informational Modifiers: “how to,” “what is,” “benefits of”Commercial Modifiers: “best,” “compare,” “reviews”Transactional Modifiers: “buy,” “order,” “schedule”Navigational Modifiers: “login,” “support,” “location”Audit your keyword listOnce you have a big list of keywords, it’s time to audit and see which ones are worth your energy.
