By: Anne Mercogliano June 18, 2014 Three Lead Generation Card Tips from the @TwitterSmallBiz Playbook Social Media | Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Last August, we launched the Lead Generation Card to all advertisers on Twitter. Since then, we've been impressed with the many small and medium businesses who have integrated the Lead Generation card into their marketing strategy, and seen powerful results. We thought it would be valuable to share a page from our own playbook and offer a behind-the-scenes look at how the @TwitterSmallBiz team has been using Lead Generation Cards to accomplish our goals. Below, we'll discuss what a Lead Generation Card is, and the three keys to success that we've uncovered through our experience using the product. What is a Lead Generation Card? A Lead Generation Card is simply a link that allows you to gather new customer email addresses directly within a Tweet. When you tweet out this link, it pre-populates a user's full name, @username and email address (previously entered in their Twitter account settings) into the expanded area of your Tweet, replacing the need for a traditional, more cumbersome form. In addition to a person's contact information, the expanded Tweet includes other elements as well: Short description: A statement that provides context and explains the value people will get from sharing their information with you. Image: A visual cue that represents your business and generates interest in your offer. Call to action: The action you want people to take, along with the benefits of doing so. Here is what a Lead Generation Card looks like when included in a Tweet: For step by step instructions on how to set up a Lead Generation Card, you can visit our dedicated support page. Our three keys to success with Lead Generation Cards Our @TwitterSmallBiz team did a lot of testing and learning before we landed on our current strategy for Lead Generation Cards. Here are three tips for your own Lead Generation Card campaigns: 1. Streamline your campaigns Twitter Ads enables you to set up multiple campaigns within your account and provides a view into performance at both the aggregate and individual campaign level. If you plan to include Lead Generation Cards in your Promoted Tweets, we recommend setting up a separate campaign that includes all of your Tweets aimed at Lead Generation. This allows you to adjust your bid independently from Promoted Tweets that have other goals, such as generating engagement, driving website traffic, etc. Within each campaign, you can also view performance at the individual Tweet level, which allows you to understand which Tweets are the biggest contributors towards your goals. When you include multiple Promoted Tweets with Lead Generation Cards in the same campaign, you can more easily compare performance across various combinations of Tweet copy and Lead Generation Card creatives. Once you determine which Lead Generation Cards and types of Tweet copy are driving the best results, you can allocate more of your budget towards those combinations and away from the ones that aren't performing as well. 2. Less isn't always more The goal behind testing and learning is to then optimize your campaigns to be as effective as possible. The more you test, the more quickly you can learn which features and combinations are most effective at helping you reach your goals. The sooner you start the testing process, the better. When you first start using Lead Generation Cards, try anywhere from five to seven different Cards across 20-30 variations of Tweet copy. A few days into your campaign, your Twitter Ads analytics will provide you with a clear view into which combinations are performing better than others so you can focus your efforts moving forward. Here's an example of how we used a similar testing framework for a recent campaign to collect email addresses around a new content offer: Lead Generation Cards: Copy for Promoted Tweets: Option #1: Lead Generation Cards make it easier than ever to generate leads on Twitter – find out how they can help your biz in this guide: Option #2: Did you know you can capture a lead in a Tweet?

Follow up When someone submits their email address through a Lead Generation Card, that person is expressing interest in your business. This creates an opportunity for you to follow up when potential customers are more likely to be receptive to your message. If you don't follow up with people after they submit an email address, they may not remain as interested or be as receptive to hearing from you. For this reason, it's important to develop a plan for how you will follow up with new leads after they submit their email address. That follow-up plan will often vary depending on the offer used for your Lead Generation Card. For example, if your offer included a new piece of content, you may want to include the email addresses you collect in an existing newsletter or email campaign list that shares similar types of content. Alternatively, if you offered event registration through your Lead Generation Card, you might want to add those email addresses to an event mailing list so that you can send additional event information or materials that were presented at the event. No matter what type of follow-up plan you choose, it should create opportunities for you to continue communicating with new leads and, ultimately, convert them into paying customers. Copied!
