By: Rand Fishkin January 24, 2005 Using RSS Readers to get the Latest SEO News Mobile SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The use of RSS has greatly expanded over the last 18 months, with every blogger on the web expounding on the virtues of subscribing to feeds. This process may seem daunting to the SEO & web reading neophyte, but luckily, this system is actually quite easy to use. Below is a list of steps to follow in order to get the most out of your RSS feeds. Setup Download and Install SharpReader (or another reader program of your choice). I prefer the browser-separate readers because they inform you on the desktop when a news item occurs (or you can manually set them to update as often as you please). Choose Sites Visit your favorite blogs/websites/forums and look for the RSS feed button. It typically looks something like this: Add Feeds Click the link and add the site to your feed (this is either done in the program's console or through your browser depending on the program you're using). Configure Set your options to your liking and watch as the SEO news of the day flies across the bottom of your screen. The RSS feeds are an excellent way to keep track of the latest in the SEO world without resorting to visiting all your bookmarks one by one. Copied! Back to Top",
