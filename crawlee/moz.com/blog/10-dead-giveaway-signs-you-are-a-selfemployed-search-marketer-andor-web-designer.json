By: Brian Brown March 3, 2007 10 Dead Giveaway Signs You Are a Self-Employed Search Marketer and/or Web Designer Moz News This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. While many of these may apply to anyone within the industries, the self-employed souls should certainly identify with... Everyone you know thinks you have the greatest life.... sleeping in until 11 everyday and then \"playing around\" online all day or watching TV, yet, ironically, you can't remember the last time you got more than 5 hours of sleep... and probably can't remember the last time you slept in late either. You no longer zone out local commercials... listening to the radio or watching TV are as much about new business development as entertainment. Regardless of preference, you've begun buying frozen pizzas based on quantity pricing (6 for $10) and by net wt. (Palermo's Thin Crust Supreme Pizzas at 20.4oz. are highly recommended... and luckily, quite good too! Note to self: look into Palermo's as a client.). You read more books (or the equivalent) in a year now than you did in 16+ years of formal education. The thought of having an iPod is exciting because of all the podcasts and vidcasts you could store on it to further keep up with the industry. The most time during waking hours not online, or at least at a computer, are during driving, showering or other times in the bathroom (laptop owners, your time may vary). Eating every meal at the computer doesn't bother you any more... but the time spent away while preparing meals in the kitchen is an issue needing to be addressed. You applaud other designers who have adopted printer friendly CSS... not because of good design, usability or web standards, but because it saves even more paper, especially when printing 4 up on a page. Sitting down to watch the news has taken on a completely different meaning to you. Two bills are guaranteed to be paid each month... ISP and electric (laptop owners, electric may be optional some months). So what does your list look like? Copied! Back to Top",
