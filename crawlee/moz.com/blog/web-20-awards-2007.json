By: Jane Copland May 9, 2007 Web 2.0 Awards 2007 Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Today, we're launching our second annual Web 2.0 Awards. Only a month after we'd intended on launching (SES New York and that pesky \"real work\" stuff kept getting in the way), we've finally collected, collated and presented just over 200 sites in forty-one categories. Some of the winners and \"honorable mentions\" are similar to last year; others are completely different. I won't go into too much detail here about the process and how it was different to the inaugural awards of 2006 - Rand has put together a neat zeitgeist to explain all that fun stuff - but I do want to say a huge thank-you to all of our readers who nominated websites. The majority of the new entrants and finalists were brought to our attention via nominations, and more than one reader-nominated site ended up winning its category. While we've ended up awarding places and \"honorable mentions\" to 205 sites, we reviewed many more. We have also re-opened nominations for next year (ducks from barrage of emails), so if you find that your favourite site is missing, submit it via our online form. So we hope you enjoy the awards and find some cool sites you haven't come across or haven't used before! Copied! Back to Top",
