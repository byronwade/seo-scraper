D By: Dmitry Gushchin June 11, 2010 Niche Analysis Tool Review SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Easy SEO Tracking Niche Analysis Tool Review Today I want to take a closer look at the tool I created recently - Niche Analysis Tool. To explain it quickly, it is a search engine optimization (SEO) tool which aims to save a lot of time performing basic market research by analyzing keywords and phrases to tell you which sites are using them most effectively. You can then use this information to improve your own site and climb the rankings. Analyze Competition The functionallity is very simple. The text entry box is on the left, and instructions are on the right. That’s it, and it means you aren’t overwhelmed by a load of images and text – everything is right there and it’s pretty intuitive to use. To start the process, you just need to type in the keywords or phrases you want to analyse and hit the ‘Check Competition’ button. Give the tool a few seconds, and it will come back with the results of its analysis. This is the part we’re really interested in, so what does it tell us and how useful is it? The results are presented in table form, with four columns. These give the URL of the sites found with the keyword the Google page rank for each of these sites the number of backlinks and whether the keywords appear in the URL or the title of the site. Analyse Competitors' Links A nice touch that the tool provides is the ability to look a bit further into competitors’ sites. Click the ‘Analyse Links’, and you’ll get a breakdown of the backlinks associated with the relevant site (see below). Be warned though, if the site has a lot of links it can take a while for the results to come back, because a lot of information need to be proccessed. This analysis means you get to see which sites are linked to your competitors and what their page ranking is, so if you want to make a note of them for some more research you can do. Summary If you haven’t already, try the tool with some of the keywords from your sites and see who your competitors are. Once you’ve done that, you can shift your focus towards beating them in the rankings and you’ll have a head start as you know how they are using their keywords. Copied! Back to Top",
