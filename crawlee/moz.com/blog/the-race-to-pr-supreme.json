P By: PlanetBerryLLC April 2, 2008 The Race to PR Supreme SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. There are so many twists and turns when it comes to SEO. The holy grail of PR is the quest of many. Is my niche too narrow? If I build, will anyone come or notice? What happens is if the best laid plans are lost in a sea of Zeros and Ones? No one can guarantee that their methods are foolproof. There are all types of methodologies that make sense and seem to garner attention from the media and bloggers. What really works? It's content. Simple. Tried and true. People don't turn on their computers or PDA's and listen to web sites (lthough, there are many musical sites so I take that back a tad). People surf the net in search of truth or justice or fun. They type words to find words which lead to articles. Publishers or web owners seek visitors. I must have traffic or I fold my tent. We went hunting a few years ago and found our first SEO partner. It worked for a while, but they strayed and began heading in a direction that was all about the right column or the left column loading up with Adsense. That turns people off. So, we packed our bags. That is not a simple task, mind you, as we found out later when it took 10 days (back then) to transfer our web site to our present home. Lessons learned. So, after all that heartache and painful retyping, oh ya, we lost almost everything! We now have a 300 page site that is 30% growing from external writers. Writers like content!!! We found a great partner to host our site and teach us about the true meaning of building a web based business. Our partner taught us patience and to work on building a deep and meaningful site that keeps visitors' interest and keeps them coming back. It builds loyalty. Well, after 11 months of rebuilding we now have a PR4 with Google. Not too impressive sounding, but like an earthquake, a PR movement has meaning to the search engines and advertisers of the world.
