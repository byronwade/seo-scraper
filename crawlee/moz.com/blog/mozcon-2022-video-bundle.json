Thought Leadership and SEO: The 3 Key Elements and Search Ranking Strategies Andy Crestodina Everyone wants to do it, but no one really knows what it is. So what is thought leadership? What isn’t it? And how does it affect search rankings? This presentation is a data-rich perspective on the oh-so-popular topic of thought leadership, filled with practical takeaways for becoming an authority. And it’s all about the relationship between thought leadership and SEO. We’ll see how the research answers the questions and informs the tactics: Can brands be thought leaders? Can it be outsourced? Do you need to publish research? Or strong opinion? And how does it attract links and authority, rankings, and qualified visitors? Learn how a personal brand combines with content to drive big wins in SEO. Great Expectations: The Truth About Digital PR Campaigns Shannon McGuirk In her talk, Shannon will challenge the desire for virality over consistency when it comes to digital PR and link building campaigns, while exploring the impact on the industry, team morale, and client expectations. By honestly sharing her own shortcomings, she'll push you to learn from your own campaign failures using tried and tested frameworks that’ll mean you can face any creative campaign or outreach struggle head-on. Whatever You Do, Put Billboards in Seattle – Getting Brand Awareness Data from Google Robin Lord How can you harness the vast power of Google data to gain special insight into city- and product-level brand awareness? Robin will lead us on a journey through his Google Trends methodology to use Adwords search volume data for better brand intelligence. How to Build a Global Brand Without a Global Budget Phil Nottingham As funnel-based marketing becomes less effective and harder to measure, \"building a brand\" is frequently touted as the panacea for all marketer's woes. But it's unclear how this can be achieved scalably and with a limited budget. Large enterprises resort to huge creative advertising campaigns that get their names out there by force of spend alone — but this isn't realistic for the smaller companies and the number of impressions is not the number of people impressed. In this session, Phil explains how modern brands are built through advocacy more than awareness alone, offering a deliverable method of brand marketing to radically shake up your content strategy. The Science of Seeking Your Customer Alexis Sanders Users are at the core of everything we do in modern SEO. However, finding and understanding audiences can be daunting. Alexis will cover how to find your audience, share tools that are available for all price points, and show ways in which she’s found audience research to be useful as an SEO. Moving Targets: Keywords in Crisis Dr. Peter J. Meyers Too often, we take a once-and-done approach to keyword research, but Google changes at the pace of information, and that pace speeds up even more during a crisis. How do we do keyword research in fast-paced industries and during world-changing moments? Dr. Pete provides concrete tactics for adaptive keyword research and spotting trends as they happen. A Novel Approach to Scraping SEO Data Rob Ousbey Throughout a decade in SEO consulting, Rob needed to extract data from websites on many an occasion. Often this was at scale from sites that didn't have an API or export feature, or on sites that required some kind of authentication. While this was primarily a way to collect & combine data from different SEO tools, the use-cases were endless. He found a technique that helped immensely, particularly when traditional tools couldn't do the job — but hadn't seen anyone using the same approach. In this very tactical session, Rob will walk through the steps he's used to extract data from all sorts of sites, from small fry to the giants, and give you the tools and knowledge to do the same. Let It Go: How to Embrace Automation and Get Way More Done Francine Rodriguez Let the robot uprising begin! We've all heard horror stories about the dangers of automating your tasks, but now is not the time to deny yourself extra help. Robots never sleep. They don't get tired or overwhelmed by their to-do lists, and they're ready to work round-the-clock to accomplish whatever task we set before them. In this talk, you'll explore all the areas were automation is kicking butt in PPC — and how you can harness the power of robots to make more time for other efforts. Designing a Content Engine: Going from Ideation to Creation to Distribution Ross Simmonds What does it take to develop a content engine that drives results?

How to Go Beyond Marketing for Clients: The Value of a Thriving Brand Ecosystem Flavilla Fongang Too many marketers serve their clients the bare minimum of what's expected from an agency.

How to Be Ahead of the (CTR) Curve Izzi Smith Let’s face it: Carrying out SEO magic is all in vain when you’re forgetting about how your brand and products are being surfaced in the SERPs.

Izzi will help you create the perfect SERP engagement strategy by covering practical ways to uplift your significant CTR, such as remedying your critical keyword rankings that could soon be lost, leveraging brand-empowering entity features (and assessing the risks of doing so), more intelligent testing of rich & featured snippet optimizations, and a whole lot more.

This year, he's back to share the hottest technical tactics to up-level your efforts, plus the case studies and data that should be guiding your decisions. Everyday Automation for Marketers David Sottimano As a general rule, we shouldn't be doing things that a computer can do better.

Red Flags: Use a Discovery Process to Go from Red Flags to Green Lights Dana DiTomaso Ever get a few months into working with a new client and you’re thinking “if only we’d known…”? Or how about when you start that new job, except you can’t seem to make any forward progress because you’re always mopping up prior mistakes? Running a discovery process at the start of a project — or even as its own project — will help you turn those red flags into green lights. Competitive Advantage in a Commoditized Industry Heather Physioc SEO isn't dead — it’s commoditized. In a world where search companies are a dime a dozen and brands tout bland \"unique selling propositions\" that aren't unique at all, how can you avoid drowning in the sea of sameness? What are you doing that's any different from every other SEO firm? In this talk, you'll learn how to find, activate, and articulate your competitive advantage. Learn how to identify unique strengths and innovative offerings that equate to competitive advantage through these real, working examples so you can bring them to life in search.

The CMO Role Has Been Disrupted: Are You Ready for Your New Boss? Wil Reynolds CMOs have the shortest tenure in the c-suite, and the CMO role has been eliminated at some of the largest brands.

Connecting your data and building your data flywheel is one way to support the swift answers CEOs expect from their CMOs.
