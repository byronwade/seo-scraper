By: kyles November 5, 2007 Make Your Search Campaign Remarkable! Marketing Industry This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I arrived home from our annual camping trip today. We go away with five other families once a year; we’ve been doing so for the past five. We had a superb time. Waking up to the sound of the chickens cocking and the sunlight shining. It really was an exceptional trip. One evening I was thinking about our trip, a book that I had read many times before came to mind. It made me think - the trip was a Purple Cow - it was remarkable. Everything about the trip was remarkable, the managers, the environment, and the people we were with, all remarkable. Most of you would know what I’m talking about here – Seth Godin's book Purple Cow. A camping ground is the same as a company that markets well – it’s inviting, the managers are friendly, and they know what we, the consumer, want. You might be wondering what my point is with this post, why am I using a camping ground as an analogy? Well, if an SEO campaign is going to be successful it has to be remarkable – just like the camping ground. If you want your website to be the best, to get those number one rankings, you have to make it different, exceptional, exciting, and interesting. You can apply all the techniques mentioned in Purple Cow to your SEO campaign. Make everything about your campaign remarkable. You're guaranteed to get somewhere with your SEO campaigns as long as you’re committed and your offerings are remarkable. Still don’t know what I’m talking about? Pick up a copy of Seth Godin’s Purple Cow – it will change your thinking on the marketing and search marketing world. Plus, it’s an exceptional read. Copied! Back to Top",
