I By: IgorMordkovich March 22, 2007 Increasing the Length of Website Visit ....It's All About The Size On-page SEO This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I would not consider myself a “blind man” or a senior who needs the text size on the webpage to be set at 24 points. Yet, I see that website owners forget that it’s a pain in the a** to read web copy … especially if it’s in small text size. One of the websites I manage sells to seniors and their caregivers. When we launched the website the text size we used was 11 in Arial font. Changing the font size to 13 (duh) and testing this theory in a A/B split test proved that people spent more time browsing the web with the larger font. You don’t have to sell to seniors to increase your font size. I am a young guy who reads quite a few blogs every other day. 30 minutes into the reading my eyes are popping out. Why do blogs use smaller font size??? Are they trying to fit everything into one page or make their posts seem \"fancy\"? When I started my blog (pardon the plug), the template had a pre-set font size of 10. A quick change to 12 made my day. Look into your website or a blog. Is it easy to read? Today about 70% or more website visitors have a screen resolution set at over 1000 by 700. Try doing an A/B test with increased text size. You just might notice that the length of the visit has increased. Copied! Back to Top",
