By: Rand Fishkin March 2, 2006 Measuring Success Session @ SES SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Today was my last presentation for SES NYC. The subject was case studies of measuring success and I used one of our clients that was mentioned in Newsweek - Avatar Financial. The session was terrific, with the exception that the third member of our panel, Glenn Alsup of Viewmark, never showed up, called or emailed.I can't imagine why someone would bail on a conference session like that without informing Danny ahead of time. Hopefully it's nothing serious.We talked primarily analytics during the 45 minute Q+A - one of the most high level and informative/honest Q+A's I've ever seen at the conference, actually. Tony Wright from Kinetic is a superbly informed search marketer and his experience with many of the big analytics tools really paid off. It was funny to learn that both of us recommend and use IndexTools above all the others - the price to performance is just so high that the few features it doesn't have are overshadowed by value.Interestingly, there were a few folks from Google Analytics in the audience acting a tad peculiar. I asked at one point, if anyone was in the audience representing Google Analytics and the gentlemen remained silent and seated. Then later they announced they did work at Google analytics, but when Detlev (who was moderating) asked if there was any way audience members could sign up, they said \"talk to us.\" Apparently, there's still a very long waiting list...Not the greatest public relations, certainly. I suppose Tony, Detlev and I all criticizing GG didn't help much, either. Free is cool, but waiting lists and sharing data with the search crews are not so cool - at $150-$300/month, Indextools is an easy choice (we agreed that we also liked ClickTracks & WebSideStory).Another cool cartoon from the presentation: Copied!
