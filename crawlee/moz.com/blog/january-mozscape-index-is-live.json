  "content": "January Mozscape Index is Live! Moz Tools By: Carin Overturf January 11, 2013 Table of Contents Copied! By: Carin Overturf January 11, 2013 January Mozscape Index is Live! Moz Tools Today, we are releasing the latest Mozscape index - just three weeks after our last release on 12/21! Mozscape data has been refreshed across all our applications so you can see the latest data in Open Site Explorer, the Mozbar, PRO campaigns, and the Mozscape API. The top focus of the Big Data team in the next couple months is to get our Mozscape index releases to be more frequent - consistently releasing every three weeks, and then, ultimately, every two weeks. We're utilizing both the high power compute AWS machines as well as our own virtual private cloud setup in our Virginia colocation. At this point, processing in AWS is still slightly faster than processing in our private cloud. However, our top notch Tech Ops team is working closely with us to fine tune our implementation of Open Stack, open source software that allows us to put a virtual layer on top of our fleet of hardware in Virginia. Our own super computers in Virginia should give us even more computing power than we've seen in AWS, meaning faster index processing and more frequent releases for you guys! Here are the metrics for this latest index: 68,291,839,694 (68 billion) URLs 512,802,814 (512 million) Subdomains 96,918,414 (97 million) Root Domains 771,699,931,943 (771 billion) Links Followed vs. Nofollowed 2.24% of all links found were nofollowed 56.32% of nofollowed links are internal 43.68% are external Rel Canonical - 11.39% of all pages now employ a rel=canonical tag The average page has 61 links on it 51.68 internal links on average 8.77 external links on average And the following correlations with Google's US search results: Page Authority - 0.36 Domain Authority - 0.19 MozRank - 0.24 Linking Root Domains - 0.30 Total Links - 0.25 External Links - 0.29 This index is a little bit smaller than the previous index, but fairly fresh with the oldest data being crawled late November and the freshest from January 1st. As you can see from the histogram, a pretty big portion was crawled mid- to late-December! We always love to hear your thoughts!
