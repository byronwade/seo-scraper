F By: fotoflo December 9, 2007 Ask the Readers: How Long Does it Take to Get a Web Campaign/Blog Rolling? SEO Analytics This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Dear Blog Readers, SEO Optimizers, and Fellow Marketing Professionals, I am a relative noob at blogging and SEO, but that didn’t stop me from getting a new job building my company’s website, setting up our corporate blog, and commandeering a 21 inch flat-screen monitor from my boss’s closet. Now that I’ve got a second monitor (and our new domain went up today, and I’ve setup two Wordpress sites, one in Chinese and one in English, and got our team cranking out bilingual content, and [relevant] link bait, etc), how long should I expect it to take for the site to get popular? What kind of curve should I expect on our analytics? Assuming I do a decent job at everything, I should expect some spikes and then dropoff, but with a continual rise, right? But how long should it take to see results? And what kind of goals are reasonable? Ok, now I know that these questions are unreasonably vague and this kind of analysis is my job, but I Googled it, and read the FAQ and TFM and didn’t find and any relevant info, so I ask you: how do you go about assessing launch progress and setting attainable goals?
