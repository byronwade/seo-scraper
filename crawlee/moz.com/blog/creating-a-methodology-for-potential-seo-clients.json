J By: Justin Smith October 28, 2008 Creating a Methodology for Potential SEO Clients Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. This is a topic that has haunted me for years. And to this day, it is not something I've been able to master completely. How do you approach a potential SEO/SEM client? Do you have a checklist, a script, or list of questions? From where I'm sitting, there is truly no set way to initially evaluate each customer unless you only strictly offer one type of service such as PPC management or link building. If you offer a fuller range of SEO services like I do, you never quite know what you're going to get in a client. It could be a small local business that is starting from scratch, a medium sized company that has a great website but just needs consulting, or a large company that has utterly failed with SEO and doesn't even know how they got there. My plan of action is going to be vastly different in each case... so how can I possibly pretend that each one fits some sort of model??? For reference, these are some of the questions I run through as a mental checklist with any potential client I speak with: What are the company's search marketing goals? (if any) Currently engaging in PPC or SEO projects? (if so, review) Is there a certain demo or audience they are trying to reach? Is the company simply trying to outrank a competitor for one keyword phrase? (I usually try to talk them out of this) Does the company have a current reputation management problem on the search engines? What has the company done in the past to improve organic SEO? Does the company understand what SEO is? (a basic coaching session may be in order to define the terminology and goals for a campaign) Who has control of the website? (in house developers, outsourced IT company, hosting company, or Joe: the guy from sales that knows how to use MS Front Page) Are there active additions being made to the website in the way of new content? (new articles, pages, blog posts, events, pictures, etc.) Is the company willing to commit to the website as a major marketing tool? (Time, money, resources, etc.) Who in the company can actually make a final decision about moving forward with an SEO campaign? For smaller companies, I try to feel out rough budget numbers to see if they are realistic while at the same time taking a look at the competition to see if the client is viable from my perspective. Sponsored search? I'll typically run through an example sponsored search scenario to see if it fits the model and target of the business. (monthly spend can also be a factor here) The more businesses I talk to, the more proposals I write, the more customers I work with, the more I realize that there are simply too many variables required in a proper evaluation to come up with a set methodology for all my clients. I can ask all these questions and more, but at the end of the day, I have to look at each potential customer with a fresh set of eyes and make customized decisions based on their particular needs. Every website and company is unique and can't be placed inside a one size fits all box. I'm frankly sick and tired of the hack SEO companies out there that speak in platitudes about how they can get you #1 ranking for only $299! It's ridiculous, and I'm tired of having to compete with these snake oil salesman (like the local yellow page company) when my product is so vastly superior. Am I off-base here? Should I not be wasting my time with customized solutions for customers and simply come up with a \"click here to buy\" kind of a product? Maybe I'm fishing for some validation here. A little help? Do you have a set way of evaluating a new customer? I would love to hear it. Copied! Back to Top",
