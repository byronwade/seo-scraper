By: Rand Fishkin January 25, 2006 Talking about LinkBait Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Everyone's on about linkbait these days. First Matt mentioned it, now Loren Baker's got a post and Andy's covering both. I thought I'd throw in my $0.02 real quick, as SEOmoz has gone fishing for links quite successfully in the recent past. Our recent heavily linked-to projects include: Search Ranking Factors List | 1,280 links (Yahoo) | Page Views - 52,406 Beginner's Guide to SEO | 7,620 links (Yahoo) | Page Views - 66,636 IP Lookup on Google Maps via AJAX | 277 links (Yahoo) | Page Views - 46,545 That's a lot of link love coming to these projects - we'll certainly be launching quite a few more over the next year in order to exploit this trend to the fullest (while it lasts).
