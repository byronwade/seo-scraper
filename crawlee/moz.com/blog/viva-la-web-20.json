K By: Klikhir March 22, 2007 Viva la Web 2.0 Social Media This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Are web 2.0 days numbered? A friend emailed me a recent article by Amanda Gome of Smart Company wherein she states Web 2.0 days are numbered. You need to register on their site to see the article so here are some snippets to get the gist what she said. “It’s extremely unfashionable but I’m calling it: Web 2.0’s days are numbered.” “The consequences of true Web 2.0 in the corporate world? Companies and people are being defamed, copyright infringed and regulations broken. People who write under false names to push specific agendas are poisoning communities.” “The legal action that is going to sweep through Web 2.0 is only just beginning and will take companies down in its wake.” Whether online or offline, companies should always be subjected to scrutiny by the public and community. I believe Web 2.0 is the next innovation that will change corporate management’s ideas about accountability. There are numerous examples of offline defamation (not mentioning names) against Corporations and SMEs. Big companies create and field storms – it’s a part of company life, PR, marketing, bad choices, good decisions, scientific discoveries, and public scrutiny. The only difference with online is the lightning speed word of mouth communication available to us today. When I was a kid whatever my parents told me was gospel. But my own kids will never take anything I say as the truth until they have corroborated with others on the subject matter - online. If I told my kid that Emporer Nasi Goreng built the Great Wall of China to keep the rabbits out, they will quickly identify me as an idiot. There will always be a need to moderate user generated content to comply with comment, review, or submission rules. I don’t think \"a few spoil it for the rest of us,\" as Gome states in her article. On the contrary, it’s the Web 2.0 community, and their millions of users, who are pioneering transparency, accountability, and better communications for all – are ever spiraling upwards towards greater human intelligence, integrity, and respect. The next generation will never think old school ideas. The ones who grow up to be corporate bosses will find new and creative ways to engage their consumers. Viva la Web 3.0. Copied! Back to Top",
