The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I was reading up on Wired.com, as I do everyday, and I came across what seemed like a fun project called The Big Word Project. What is The Big Word Project? \"The Big Word Project is redefining words. Search for your word and link it to your website. Your website is then the new definition. Simple.\" \"The project allows you to purchase a word from our list to represent your site. Your site will then represent this word in our list and when people click on it, they will be taken to your site. The project is aimed at changing definitions and creating a new tapestry of words, meaning altogether different things.\" Yeah... I know what you're thinking. Matt Cutts just felt a weird sensation and turned back to see that no one was actually there. And why did Matt cringe? Because this site is selling the links. PR of the site: 6 Price of each link: 1 buck One buck??? Wired says that the site can be \"a cheap way to place an ad — granted to a limited audience of word nerds.\" Yeah, right. Did I mention that the links are dofollowed? Matt, can you see me now? :-D Copied! Back to Top",
