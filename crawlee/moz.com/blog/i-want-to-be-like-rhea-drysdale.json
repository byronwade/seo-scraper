By: Sarah Bird March 15, 2010 I Want To Be Like Rhea Drysdale E-Commerce SEO May It Please the Mozzers, I haven't written on the blog in months, but I simply couldn't let today pass by without acknowledging the courage and perserverance shown by Rhea Drysdale in her pursuit of justice. She's my hero and I want to be just like her--A woman of action and humble fortitude. Rhea announced victory against Jason Gambert in a trademark dispute lasting more than two years. She fought to prevent \"SEO\" from becoming trademarked for one mysterious man's private use. She fought on behalf of all of us who work in the SEO industry. Like many of you, I feel sad and ashamed I couldn't do more to support Rhea--but we've had other legal trouble to sort out at SEOmoz that consumes our limited legal resources. :( Lawsuits are expensive, stressful, and very time consuming. There is nothing glamorous or certain about them. Even when you're in the right, you have to keep worrying about whether justice will prevail, and whether you'll be broke or demoralized before it finally does. I'm feeling really jazzed and happy today because Rhea has bolstered my belief in people, the SEO industry, and the justice system. As Joanna Lord said earlier, \"Its a good industry-day folks, good industry day :)\" It just feels warm-and-fuzzy to work in a community of people like Rhea who sacrifice a lot without hope of any financial gain. And of people like Aaron Wall, Michael VanDeMar, Barry Schwartz and many others who've publically supported and recognized Rhea for her efforts both today and in the past. I just wanted everyone out there in blogland to know that we have a big crush on Rhea and a big crush on the SEO industry. It's so great to see everyone coming together to support Rhea and recognize what she's done for all of us. You can show your support by helping Rhea recoup some of her legal fees. She's updating her blog with the best way to donate to her (without inadvertently giving her some tax grief!) on the OutSpokenMedia blog. Group Hug!
