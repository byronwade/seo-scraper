By: Rebecca Kelley November 20, 2006 British Vocabulary 101 Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Well, I'm back from England. After a weekend filled with television, giant cheeseburgers, and free refills, I returned to work today. Rand, Jeff, and Jane gave me the scoop on PubCon antics, Matt called me a nerd for wearing my glasses (I'm still trying to adjust back to Seattle time, and contacts = burning), and Scott kept reminding me to not call security because he isn't trespassing and actually does work for us. Basically, it's good to be back. :) Anyway, for my first post-England post, I thought I'd supply you loyal readers with an introductory course in British slang. Thanks to Ammon, Adam, and Lee at Fresh Egg, I now have a mastery of British terms that sound suspiciously like Fraggle Rock characters. 1. muppet [mup-pet] As Ammon put it, a muppet is someone who \"commits web design atrocities.\" Ex. \"Not only does that muppet's site only work with IE, it has a splash page and requires frames.\" 2. numpty [nump-tee] Someone who, even after being shown all the evidence to fix something, still insists on doing it the wrong way. Ex. \"Michael Martinez is such a numpty.\" (Haha, just joking MM) 3. plonker [plonk-er] A more socially accepted version of \"d--k head\" Ex. \"Those plonkers at Yahoo! wouldn't let me into their party!\" 4. gobshite [gob-shy-tuh] Someone who talks too much Ex. \"Rand, you gobshite! Stop sharing link building tactics on your blog!\" 5. codswallop [cod-swall-up] A load of bull Ex. \"Google's Page Rank is a load of codswallop.\" 6. naff [nah-f] Dodgy, sketchy Ex. \"That was pretty naff of Matt Cutts to bring up politics at PubCon.\" 7. chav [chav] Trailer trash Ex. \"Did you see that chav's MySpace profile?\" Thanks again to Fresh Egg for being my home away from home. I'll write up an in-depth article of my internship abroad and will hopefully have it up after Thanksgiving. Until then, look out for Jeff and Jane's coverage of PubCon coming soon. Copied!
