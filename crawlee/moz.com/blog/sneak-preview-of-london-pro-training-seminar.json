By: Will Critchlow September 8, 2009 Sneak Preview of London PRO Training Seminar SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The time has come to register for the London PRO Training Series 2009: Tips, Tricks and Tactics. Building on the success of the recent Seattle event, we have gathered in London some of the best SEOs around and given them strict instructions to make their presentations as actionable and tips-focussed as possible. It's time to get your ticket for 19th-20th October. Unlike larger conferences, there is no expo hall, no choosing between different tracks and everything is designed to be useful for expert practitioners. Read on to get a sneak preview of what to expect. How to book The essential details you need to know in order to book are: When: 19th and 20th October 2009 Where: The Imagination Gallery (although you have to download some PDFs, it's worth checking out the great location), Store Street, WC1E 7BL - just off Tottenham Court Road in London's West End. How much: just $599 for PRO members, and only $899 for non-PRO (which currently works out at about £370 or EUR 420 for PRO) The spectacular venue for the London seminar Why it's going to rock I promised a sneak preview of what you're going to get at the London event.

The seminar rooms at the Imagination Gallery And once the hard work is out of the way, your ticket gets you access to the exclusive event on the Monday night at the Charlotte Street Blues Bar. I can personally vouch for their cocktails, food and spectacular range of bourbons (what? Someone had to try it out). There will be at least three of the following: Cocktails / finger food Live music A chance to chat informally with the fantastic speakers and other attendees Copies of Google's algorithm lying around Don't take my word for it In a survey of attendees of the recent Seattle conference, 90% said they were \"extremely\" or \"very\" satisfied with the seminar. They loved Ben Jesson's and Tom's presentations (both of whom are presenting in London) and previous attendees have had these things to say: An excellent high level seminar with substantial advanced tactics. Having attended numerous SEO conferences, this had a much greater ROI. -Greg Patterson, President, Mojo Juice Inc. Chock full of detailed strategies, theories and practical explanations of very advanced search optimization methodologies. It was worth every penny (and more, but don't tell Rand I said so!). -Marty Martin, Director of Web Strategies, Leisure Publishing Co. Better than any other SEO conference I've attended and the price was less. -Mike Perez, President, High Ranking Websites, Inc. Book now If you're still not convinced, my top 5 reasons to book a place at the SEOmoz / Distilled London PRO training are: Get unparalleled access to Rand Fishkin, the whole Distilled crew, Jane Copland (ex-SEOmoz - now at Ayima), Richard Baxter (in-house SEO supremo turned consultant), the ever-hilarious Dave Naylor, Ben Jesson (whose recent presentations have blown me away every time) and Patrick Altoft's quietly spoken genius. Hear the top two presentations from the Seattle seminar, a bunch of never-heard-before presentations and hopefully be among the first to hear the results of Ben Hendrickson's in-depth ranking models work - the largest and most comprehensive quantitative study I know of into exactly how much each factor affects rankings. Last time Rand challenged me to a presentation-off, I scraped in ahead. Chastened, bruised, he came back to win a similar event at the Seattle seminar the other week. I can't believe he is going to come with anything less than his A-game this time around. If you want to see us going head to head, this is your chance. It rains in Seattle all the time (Rand claims this isn't true but it's rained on me every time I've been there). In London, by contrast, it only rains some of the time. But in seriousness, London's a great city. If you live here, you should come because the seminar's local and easy. If you don't live in London, come learn SEO in the greatest city in the world (TM). It's not all work and no play. We have organised a fantastic evening's entertainment for the Monday night when you'll be able to relax and chat with all the people you've met during the day. For the seriously hardcore, there are also rumours of a LondonSEO event on the Tuesday evening to talk even more SEO. If you have any questions, leave them in the comments, otherwise book your ticket and we'll see you there. What would you like to see for the head to head? Last time Rand and I had a presentation-off, it was on the relatively boring subject of analytics. We were chatting on the phone yesterday and haven't yet decided what our big show-down should be about. We are considering keyword research, but are still open to other ideas. If you are coming (or are going to buy the DVD) then leave us a note in the comments about what you'd like to see for the big rematch. Oh, and just in case I haven't said it often enough yet, don't forget to book your place. If you have any questions about it you can drop me an email. Copied! Back to Top",
