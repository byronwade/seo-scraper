E By: EGOL December 4, 2005 digg.com Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Today was pretty interesting. One of my websites was generating a lot more email than normal and all of it was coming in on the same new page. I chalked it up to coincidence. Tonight when I ran my logs it looked like I was getting slashdotted! - except the referrer was www.digg.comSomeone had submitted a story from my site there and I was getting thousands of visitors. At digg you submit a story and the users decide if it merits the front page. Mine made it to the front page and that's where all of this traffic was coming from.This is a neat site with lots of potential uses. Viral marketing types of stuff. I think that it would be a good place to try out your headline and title tag writing skills. Take a look and let us know what you think of it and how you think it can be used to promote your site.*chucklin* I was going to submit a page from seomoz to see if Randfish would see the traffic and bust in here like his butt was afire to post on it - but I decided to beat him to the post and instead submit another page from my own site. Maybe I can get two from my site on the digg homepage at the same time. Copied! Back to Top",
