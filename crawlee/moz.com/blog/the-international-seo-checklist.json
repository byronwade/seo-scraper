By: Aleyda Solis June 26, 2013 The International SEO Checklist International SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. In less than two weeks I will have the pleasure to speak at MozCon about international SEO, in a session called \"International SEO and the Future of your ROI.\" Before I do, I wanted to compile a checklist of the most fundamental aspects to consider when developing an international SEO process — something to which we can quickly refer that can facilitate our everyday work, and something that would also be easy to digest for our clients at some point. As a result, I've created this International SEO Checklist, with a step-by-step guide to everything from assessing the international SEO potential to targeting our international audience and the development of an internationally targeted site: I've also uploaded a higher resolution version of the checklist image, in case you want to download and print it. I hope the checklist is useful, and if you're looking to learn more about international SEO or ask me anything about it, I look forward to seeing you at MozCon! If for some reason you're not going to MozCon and have a question, please let me know in the comments. :) Copied! Back to Top",
