By: Rand Fishkin September 6, 2005 Katrina &amp; the SEO World SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Hurricane Katrina has taken a devastating toll on the gulf states of the US and the people who lived there. The SEO world has responded with a variety of donations and contributions, as well as threads, posts and information relating to the subject. DazzlinDonna of SEOChat, DigitalPoint, SEW & others was one of the hardest hit victims, and a collection is up through her website for donations. She's got an excellent post on the hurricane and her personal experience. Several threads (1, 2, 3) on the subject of her situation have popped up at the forums.- SearchEngineWatch has a few great posts and links to resources - one on the maps, people-finding projects and wikis that have been started post-Katrina and another offering banners that will link directly to the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations for those with space on their websites.- Several other blogs have posts on Katrina, including Threadwatch, SEJournal, Matt Cutts, and Kim Krause Berg Copied!
