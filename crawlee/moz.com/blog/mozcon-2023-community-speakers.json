By: Cheryl Draper May 10, 2023 Meet Our MozCon 2023 Community Speakers SEO Events | Moz News Major high fives and fist bumps for each and every person who took the time to submit pitches for this year‚Äôs community speaker spots! With only two open community speaker spots, and hundreds of pitches ranging from how to grow your career as an SEO to all manner of AI and ChatGPT-related entries, the competition was unusually tough which, in its own right is a massive indication of many incredible things to come for the future of our industry and industry events. Our selection committee read, watched, and researched, whittling things down to a shortlist of top contenders, and then read, watched, and researched some more to determine if a potential speaker and their talk would be a perfect fit for the MozCon stage this August. We take lots of things into account during our review, but ultimately there are four main factors that determine our final selections: Strength of the pitch (e.g., value, relevance to the audience, etc.)Can the content reasonably be delivered in the time allotted?Does it fit with overall programming and agenda? Will the topic have overlap with other presentations? After much deliberation, we settled on two community speakers that we‚Äôre confident are going to be a great addition to the MozCon Stage. Ready to meet our MozCon Community Speakers?

Talk: Beyond the written word: Future-proofing your content strategy by leveraging multimedia formats. In today's rapidly changing digital world, marketers must go beyond just written content to engage with their target audience in the right way.

If you want to ensure the longevity of your content strategy and also be more adaptable to the changing landscape digitally, you'll need to leverage multimedia formats such as video, audio, and more. This talk will explore the benefits of incorporating these formats into your marketing strategy, including tips on how to create engaging content that resonates with your audience and boosts conversions/sales. By the end of this session, you'll have a clear understanding of how to future-proof your content strategy and stay ahead of the competition.

Talk: Rethink Your Industry Pages - They‚Äôre Not What You Think B2B marketers, and SEOs alike, are all too quick to create industry-specific landing pages for every single vertical we serve. In reality, these pages have very little relevance to what your customers are actually searching for, or what it is that you actually do in that space - limiting the reach and missing out on potential customers who would benefit from your solutions. Are you ready to reimagine your entire industry vertical proposition? Jason will explain the ins and outs of industry pages, their role in content marketing, and - more importantly - how optimizing content around the pain points and direct needs of your customers is more relevant now in B2B marketing than ever before. We can‚Äôt wait for you to hear from these two awesome community speakers and the rest of our incredible lineup taking the MozCon stage this August 7 & 8. Grab a seat and see for yourself!
