By: Carter Cole December 9, 2009 Awesome Visual View of Google Analytics Data with Juice Analytics SEO Analytics This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. So I was reading the Google as I often do, and they have this awesome new tool for visualizing your websites analytics data and keywords. Let’s get into what these way cool tools do and how they can help us analyze what is going on with our sites in an easy to read visual way. First at the bottom you get a timeline so you can see the volume of traffic your site has been receiving and colorize this ribbon timeline by bounce rate. It’s cool to be able to see how your content starts being read more or single view articles with high bounce rates change it red. It lets you see a large overview of your site's traffic and your visitor’s behavior over time. This is also useful because you can view what pages drive the most traffic and how the bounce rate changes from page to page. I use this to find pages that receive more traffic and link to other posts they may also find useful to help lower the bounce rate for a page You can see a little better here in this shot how the bounce rate changes from page to page and how some pages are much more popular than others. Here is the little video that they put out to demonstrate the tool. I can’t embed in this format so here is the link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkgFK2rshUk Then they have this cool keyword visualization tool that shows keywords and how they relate to each other and a few different options to color by. I like either time spent on site or bounce rate to see what words seem to keep peoples interest longer or drive them away faster You can see how some keywords are red and threw more bounces and than my link bait for embedding your Google profile social icons. And the Google profile badge have green text showing that they had visitors staying for a much longer period (this graph is colored by time on page) and again the cool demo video the juice guys put out. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eo7QGhuYyk Here is the link to the tool I hope you find it useful and liked the article... oh they even have options for the colorblind so ya'll don’t feel left out.
