E By: E-Dreamz February 16, 2011 Conversion Rates Broken Down by Browser SEO Reporting This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Everyone who reads this problably looks at conversion rate on a daily basis, but how deep do you look? Do you segment traffic, view by advertising campaign, etc? I decided to dig really deep and sort conversions by browsers. The data was collected from over 20 websites that donated their stats for this inforgraphic. Their traffic ranged from millions of unique visitors all the way down to sites that received 10,000 hits a month. Each site has a unique niche and a unique geographic location to help ensure the data had no biases. The data was based on Analytic stats ranging from 01/01/2010 – 12/31/2010. Conversions By Browser The results prompt me to ask - When designing your website who are you designing for? Often that question leads into many standard advertising demographics such as age, sex, location, etc. Rarely have I heard that get answered with what kind of technology they might be using unless it was mobile. I created this infographic in hopes to change the answer to that question when creating a website. Speaking with my teammates and people in the industry we all assumed Chrome had to be the biggest conversion across the board. A more savvy user with potential technical background would be likely to spend money online right? Obviously not. Internet Explorer beat out Chrome on every single website. There was not one instance where Chrome converted higher. FireFox was the middle man – majority of sites stayed right in line with the average conversion rate. What is your take away on this? Are you franticly checking to ensure your site is 110% opitimized for IE7? It's clearly the conversion king. Copied! Back to Top",
