By: Rand Fishkin April 20, 2007 Stay In and Read this Weekend; There's a Ton of Great Stuff SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. There's so much to cover in the search world this week it's practically unbearable. Hopefully the weather is terrible and you're bored so this won't interfere too much with those pesky weekend plans. I'm personally going hiking Sunday - my first time this year (hooray!). On to the topics: The \"Google hates paid links\" story is huge and has been discussed by every blog but ours (we pride ourselves on differentiating content). However, I have to link over to Scoreboard's How to Turn Google's Paid Link Reporting Into Profit. A genius plan, Brian. Mr. Dave \"F\" Naylor put together a remarkably good post on how to trap and identify rogue bots. Brian Clark was on Digg for this story, but I need to contribute to my share of Linkerati-ism and the post on avoiding headline mistakes is worth everyone's time to read and apply. Loren Baker authored a post on Digg vs. Del.icio.us that I thoroughly enjoyed. He picks apart the logic of why a site with a smaller userbase has so much viral attention pointed its way - I'm thinking about how to apply those same principals to our sites and our clients to earn that same kind of buzz. Richard Zwicky knows what Google's real market share is - about 78%... Also, check out which portions of Google drive what percentages of traffic. Very good stuff, considering the quality of his datasources. This is what I want for SEOmoz - to be self sustaining purely via the premium content - and to be able to privately incubate great ideas internally. YCombinator has their own developer-centric news site... How did I not know about this earlier - that site rocks! Everyone's linking to it, but that's because it's so good - read Todd Malicoat's SEO Playbook... twice. You've succeeded Jonah - now you just need them to get a mention on the Colbert Report :) The Economist has a terrific article about how social media sites are finally overtaking that which has never been overtaken before - porn sites. And, I'd be remiss not to send a link over to Julian, who originally contributed the idea for our tagline. His new site is Dfinitive - the Elite Directory. Sounds a bit ominous, and the categories are a bit narrow right now, but at least Brian Turner's top on the SEO page, so they've got that right :) So, what did I miss... I mean, besides everything that Todd and Lisa covered? Copied! Back to Top",
