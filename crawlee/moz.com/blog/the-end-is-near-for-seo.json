SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. As the importance of Search Engine Optimisation gets home to the masses, the amount of good high quality search engine optimised sites increases. The potential profit margins of a good SEO site heavily outweigh the margins of a successful PPC campaign. Eventually, every man and his dog will have a good high quality, relevant search engine optimised website. Adding that to the fact that Google appear to not be making very many serious long term changes to their search engine algorithm, where does the optimisation stop? Will we hit a point where everybody has equally optimised sites? If Google does not change their algorithm and sites are getting built automatically with good SEO practice, would the SEO industry as a whole collapse?
