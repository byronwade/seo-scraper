By: Rand Fishkin February 17, 2006 Ridding the World of \"Search Engine Submission\" Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. One of my big pet peeves in the SEO world is those who claim to provide services that help get traffic from the search engines but don't - either through ignorance, greed or laziness. Regular readers of the blog should be intimately familiar with my fight against misinformation in the industry and it should come as no surprise that I was infuriated to see statistics like these when doing some random keyword research: \"Search Engine Submission\" - Wordtracker - predict 834/day \"Search Engine Submission\" - Overture - 42,845 in January \"Search Engine Submission\" - MSN AdCenter - 1,035 last month (US, English only) \"Search Engine Submission\" - KeywordDiscovery - 3,026,197 in the last 12 months, 69,091 predicted daily \"Search Engine Submission\" - Google AdWords - estimates 75 clicks/day in position 1.1 ($6.10 CPC) That's a lot of traffic for a search term that shouldn't be nearly that popular (and a clear indication that keyword research tools are all over the place). My goal, therefore, is going to be to create a document at SEOmoz on the subject of search engine submission, debunking the myths behind it and getting feedback from some folks at the search engines themselves. Hopefully I'll have it put together by the middle of March. Any ideas about content that should be included would be greatly appreciated. I'll certainly make sure that it's entirely non-promotional of SEOmoz (I'll probably even remove the permanent navigation and make a unique flat file). Copied! Back to Top",
