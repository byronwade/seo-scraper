K By: Karen Browning-Cutler October 4, 2007 A Humble Request for All SEOmoz Staff and Readers Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I have a humble request. Fall has come, so I am back in school for the last year. I enrolled in a magazine writing class because I thought it would be fun. So far it has not been fun at all, but our first assignment is to profile a person, business, or organization. I lovingly think of SEOmoz as all three, in a way, and I knew right away that I wanted to do my article on it. One of the points of my article will be that SEOmoz is revolutionary in its accessibility. Prove me right by helping me to answer the following questions. I would be very grateful. We are also encouraged to submit these articles to various magazines, so you never know where your luminous words may end up (though I would definitely let everyone know if that becomes the case!). I’d love to hear from staff members and anyone, really. Why hasn’t SEOmoz taken the format of a forum or implemented one on their site? What will SEOmoz be like in ten years? Are SEO “newbies” encouraged to use the site? Will they always be? Is SEOmoz moving to pioneer a standardized SEO certification course? Or should SEO be an undergraduate degree soon? (There was some talk of this post-SEO Quiz) If everyone had to name a single element that makes SEOmoz so rewarding to read and participate in, what would that be? Don’t feel limited to these questions. Feel free to use this space to reflect on all things SEOmoz. I appreciate everyone’s time. Copied! Back to Top",
