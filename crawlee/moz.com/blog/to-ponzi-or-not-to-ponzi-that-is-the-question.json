G By: GeoffreyF67 March 23, 2006 To Ponzi or Not to Ponzi - That is the question! Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. A little background reading first for those of you who are not familiar with what a Ponzi scheme is.I would assume most of you are doing your daily activities because you want to make some form of money and, you also hope that you'll be able to retire comfortably one day.That's an admirable goal and the Internet has spawned a plethora of various systems, methods, etc. for people to go from very little wealth to significant amounts of it in a short time.One of those method's that happens to be occuring at the rate of a fast game of whack a mole is the creation of surf for pay websites.The idea is that if you surf X number of websites you'll get paid to do so. You, of course, pay a small amount of money to participate and they pay you daily interest.So, for instance, you might put in $100 today, surf 10 sites a day, and get paid 20% of the money you have invested (compounded daily of course) for doing that small bit of surfing.After 10 days of this your $100 investment has gone to over $600 (assuming I hit the right keys on my calculator :P).The problem with all of this is that the payouts are often based on more people coming into the scheme. At some point they'll fail and those who came into the program late will lose their money.The funny thing about all of this is that it's illegal (in the US) to promote or run a Ponzi scheme but it is not illegal to be a victim.So the question then becomes - is it a bad thing if you decide to participate in a program like this knowing that you have very good odds of being a victim and that this is simply a high yield high risk investment opportunity?G-Man Copied!
