Table of Contents Copied! By: Will Critchlow September 24, 2012 Searchlove: Upcoming Conferences and a Free Video SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The Distilled Searchlove conferences are coming up in London and Boston in just over a month. These PRO discounts are our deepest ever. The SEOmoz community gives us so much, and we love being able to give a little bit back. Searchlove London - Mon 29th and Tues 30th October - £849 (only £649 with SEOmoz PRO discount) Searchlove Boston - Mon 5th and Tues 6th November - $1,299 (only $849 with SEOmoz PRO discount) 90% of last year’s attendees said they’d attend again, and we've been putting loads of effort into making this year's conference even better. This year's conferences are planned to be the biggest and best yet. It's amazing to me that we can be responsible for great speakers like Richard Baxter getting presentation training (largely because I keep writing posts like this one and raising already-high expectations!). I think this year’s speaker line-ups and schedules are some of the best we’ve ever put together - here is a small snapshot of what you can look forward to: A few of the Boston speakers (see full schedule): And a few more from London (see full schedule) If you loved the full-length video of Wil Reynolds speaking at Mozcon and want to see him live, you'll be pleased to know he is speaking in London and Boston. Mike King’s “Targeting Humans” talk If you are getting withdrawal symptoms after watching 17 hours of Mozcon videos and want more to keep you going, I've got more great news for you: we're giving away a 45 minute HD video that normally costs $70 in our store for free. Mike burst onto the speaking scene in style last year. He is one of the few people I know who has the guts to start an SEO talk dressed as MC Hammer and pull off a real live Hammer Dance. Add to that one of the highest-rated talks we’ve seen at our conferences, and you have a knockout punch of entertainment and educational value. Did I mention that Mike will be speaking at Boston? Use the code MOZMIKEFREE to get the video for free: Here’s how you get the 45-minute-long HD video completely free: Copy the 100% discount code: MOZMIKEFREE Head on over to our video store to get the video to stream or download completely free (no credit card required) Things I'm looking forward to at Searchlove I'm so excited to have a load of brilliant new speakers this year. Although some of the speakers are old friends, all of them are new to Searchlove: Dave Peiris Patrick McKenzie Lisa Myers Paul Madden Guy Levine Lauren Vaccarello Heather Healy David Mihm Dan Shapiro Ian Lurie Cindy Krum Eytan Seidman Annie Cushing Todd Friesen Ben Wills SEOmoz's very own Jen Lopez Here are a few of the things I'm personally excited to learn from the new additions to our speaker line-ups, along with some links for you to check out in the meantime: If you hang out on Hacker News, you will know Patrick McKenzie by his patio11 handle. I have been subscribed to his training videos by email since it launched, and I know I'm leaving money on the table by not implementing all his ideas. For a sneak preview, I encourage you to read about how he doubled the revenue growth rate of Server Density. Dan Shapiro's amazing recent successes (go and read about how quickly a great faceted navigation can get you acquired) make him the perfect person to talk about manufacturing serendipity. It's amazing how much of an SEO's job these days relies on who you know, so I can't wait to hone my ability to make luck go my way. I know you all know Jen. I'm so pleased she is going to be appearing for us in Boston. This whiteboard Friday on growing the value of your company twitter account is my go-to link for people looking for success in that area. Have you ever seen Ian Lurie speak? Or read one of his posts (read: rants)? I personally like this one on time management. All of this makes me think I will have a lot to learn from his presentation on making better pitches and proposals. Although we get a lot of attendees in London from across Europe (and a few from further afield), we have done relatively little on international SEO. We're remedying that with the multi-lingual Lisa Myers. I want to learn what I don't know from a true European. Because we're bringing on such an array of new talent, there are many surprises in store. The most exciting unknowns for me include: Justin Briggs (who used to work for Distilled) isn't new to Searchlove - he's rocked Boston for us in the past - but I want to see what he makes of London. We're responsible for him getting his passport... I have no idea what Rand has up his sleeve for the head to head (\"inbound marketing on a shoestring\") - I have some fun ideas of where I'm going, but I'm looking forward to seeing the direction he will take. In summary, I want you to come Wil wants you to come Stephen wants you to come Richard wants you to come Rand wants you to come We'll see you there, right?
