SEO Analytics The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I've just been shopping around for a Heat Map tracking software and stumbled upon those two, which looks good to me: CrazyEgg (I think Rand already talked about it), which is simple, easy to use and cost between 0,33$ - 0,80$ / 1 000 visits. I am not sure how deep the metrics are behind it. Has any of you tried it? It is worth it?ClickDensity is the other one I found and seemed to offer wider and more detailed statistics. Setup seems to be a breeze. Costs seem lower per 1 000's.. They offer some nice A/B test splitting, allowing you to change snippets of html code as you like to compare conversions. Deep down, my question is: is heat map tracking really going to help me? Is any of you using a similar product and discovered great insights with it? Thanks for any feedback! Copied! Back to Top",
