By: Rand Fishkin January 17, 2005 Site Flavored Theme Detection from Google Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. In September of 2003, Google acquired Kaltix Corp. While this was well reported in the blogosphere and the SEO industry, it's fascincating to see the direct correlation between this acquisition and a quick application in the form of Google's so-called site-flavored search. Luckily, the connection isn't hard to figure out, as Google has named the logo on the page - google_kaltix_site_flavored_results.gif.The tool offers the fascinating ability to see what Google thinks the theme or themes of a website are. For example, Amazon.com is apparently themed to software, while Seochat.com is themed to Marketing & Advertising, Programming & Software.Undoubtedly, this new tool will become a staple of SEOs as they attempt to measure websites in the top ranking positions by all possible means. I will attempt to create a report on this phenomenon in the near future, so that we can examine some sample sites and searches and see if the theming has any correlation to the SERPs. Copied!
