By: Rand Fishkin July 21, 2008 What Part of the SEO Process is Hardest for You? Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Every SEO has their strong points and their weak ones. For me, subjects like content creation and keyword research have always come naturally, but others like methodically using analytics data to improve and running manual link building campaigns have always been a struggle. Today, I'd thought it would be interesting to get a bit self-critical and talk about those items on the SEO-to-do-list that cause us the greatest struggles. Perhaps if we indulge our catharsis, we can grow stronger. Which of the Following SEO Tasks Presents the Greatest Challenge for You? (surveys) In the comments below, feel free to describe your struggles - what gives you the biggest headache, which tasks you dread during the workday, and what processes are ripe for outsourcing?
