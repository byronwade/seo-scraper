Don't think that everything about SEO and building websites can be found on the web. Over the past two years I have read many books about these same subjects that were printed on paper.

This book gives plenty of advice and samples on how to get the most out of your pay per click spending. It gets fairly technical in a few places and I had to read and reread to get it but the time was well spent. If you are spending a bunch of dough on PPC this book might save or make you an awful lot of money.Call to Action: Secret Formulas to Improve Online Results, by Bryan and Jeffery Eisenberg. This book is full of practical advice. Instead of getting into the nitty gritty of code the authors give you lots of ideas on what to do with traffic once you have SEOed it to your site.Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability: by Steve Krug. Last but least - this one is my top recommendation. This book is not really about SEO but it has had a greater influence on me than anything else that I have read. Krug has watched lots of people use lots of websites and gives great advice on how buttons, colors, wording and many other site elements might influence your visitors. The second edition just came out and I am reading it now and learning lots more.Have you read any useful books about websites lately? Copied! Back to Top",
