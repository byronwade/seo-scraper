But the best competitor for that competition depends on what you see in the SERP. Getting your page to rank organically is only one of the many possible strategies. In this talk, Andy will explain big picture strategies in the context of ever-more crowded search results pages. 9:45am – Search What You See: Visual Search Tactics, Tools, and Optimizations Crystal Carter Visual search has been at the forefront of Google’s search and product innovations in the last year. Join this talk for “search what you see” optimizations via Google Lens and more. 10:25am – Morning break 10:45am – Unlocking the Hidden Potential of Product Listing Pages Areej AbuAli E-commerce website product listing pages contain hidden potential. This talk is all about unlocking the magic of your listing pages by making the most out of filters and internal linking. Instead of being fixated on those landing page head terms, let’s turn our attention to the indexability of long-tail pages with high conversion. Whether you work in e-commerce or not, we’ll also cover how to embed yourself within tech teams and analyze impactful changes. 11:20am – Community Speaker – Get Your Local SEO Recipe Right with Content & Schema Emily Brady Local SEO can be so much more than off-site listings, so let’s talk about it! By using content and schema on local landing pages, businesses can create unique value that satisfies customers and search engines. 11:40am – SEO Gap Analysis: Leverage Your Competitor's Performance Lidia Infante Ranking is as easy or as hard as doing better than your competitors. For that, you have to benchmark the sites on your search landscape, meet them where they are, and gain an edge. In this talk, Lidia will share how she built SEO strategies off the back of a gap analysis, along with her templates and success stories. 12:20pm – Birds of a Feather lunch discussion tables 1:50pm – The Future of Link Building: What Got Us Here, Won’t Get Us There Paddy Moogan Ten years ago, Paddy stood on stage at MozCon and shared 35 ways to build links in 35 minutes. This year, he is going to talk about lessons he has learned during the last 10 years, some reflections on what he got right and wrong, along with what the future holds for link building. 2:25pm – Community Speaker – How to Capitalize on the Link Potential of a Research Report Debbie Chew There are many types of link magnets, but there's one that'll never go out of style: data-backed research reports. When done well, you're creating a piece of content that helps your E-A-T, drives backlinks, and is genuinely interesting content for your target audience. This talk will cover the different steps needed not just to create a research report, but to create one that can get links. 2:45pm – Breaking into new areas with Topic Maps Noah Learner In this talk we'll go beyond keyword research to explore how to build topic maps, and internal linking maps (that align with Google's understanding) to help you conquer new SERPS and win more budget from stakeholders along the way. 3:25pm – Afternoon break 3:45pm – Internal Links: Your Secret Ranking Super Power Cyrus Shepard We all know about internal links - it's so 2012 SEO, right? Cyrus dives into the data to see if our 2022 techniques still align with 2012 best practices. 4:20pm – Moneyball is the Future of SEO Will Critchlow Advanced statistical analysis has changed the face of professional sports, and similar insights are changing the way we do SEO. In this talk, Will is going to share the approaches he's seeing from the most forward-looking SEO teams, as well as the lessons learned from their analysis of what's working and what's not. 5:15pm – Day 1 Presentations conclude 7:00pm – Monday Night Welcome Party Join us at Optimism Brewing in Capitol Hill. Meet with fellow attendees and speakers over light refreshments and snacks, music, and catching sun on the patio. We look forward to bringing our community together to kick off MozCon 2022 on this special night. See you there! Tuesday, July 12th 7:30am – Breakfast & registration 9:00am – Day 2 Opening Remarks 9:05am – More Than Pageviews: Evaluating Content Success & Correcting Content Failure Dana DiTomaso Throw that tired pageview- and-bounce-rate-heavy report right out the (virtual) window — we can do better than that! Dana will peel back the layers on measuring content success. You'll learn which metrics will actually tell you if your content is doing what it's supposed to be doing, and how to link these metrics to your SEO strategies and tactics. 9:40am – Trash in, garbage out: A guide to non-catastrophic keyword research Tom Capper Keyword research is one of the first and most basic tasks that SEOs learn. And yet, it's strewn with pitfalls and ubiquitous errors, even for experienced practitioners. In this talk, Tom will talk you through the various ways the wrong data can lead you astray, and how to leverage the right techniques for the right tasks 10:20am – Morning break 10:40am – SEO In the Enterprise: Tips and Tricks for Growing Organic Traffic at Scale Jackie Chu In this talk, Jackie will show us how to identify, prioritize and get buy-in on large-scale SEO campaigns to drive traffic and revenue. 11:15am – The Future of Local Landing Pages Amanda Jordan Location landing pages are extremely important for local business but are often repetitive and uninteresting. This presentation will focus on strategies that can make your location landing pages useful and interesting to search engines and site visitors. We'll discuss ways to incorporate first party data, third party data, and user generated content to create local landing pages that don't fall short. 11:55am – Birds of a Feather lunch discussion tables 1:25pm – Community Speaker – How Marketing Data Intelligence Skyrocketed Our B2B Conversions Tina Fleming If you want to geek out on data, you've come to the right session. And we're not talking about Google Analytics or your plain old CRM data. We're talking about de-anonymizing your website traffic, providing one-on-one personalized user experiences, shortening your lead forms without missing out on valuable information, and doing everything you can to get to that SQL. In this presentation, Tina will demystify the basics of marketing data intelligence, reveal actionable strategies for your day-to-day conversion marketing, and share real examples of how her agency has skyrocketed B2B conversions with the addition of marketing intelligence. 1:45pm – Achieve Accessibility Goals with Machine Learning Miracle Inameti-Archibong 3.8 million U.S. adults aged 21-64 have a visual impairment, but 98% of the world’s top 1 million websites don’t offer full accessibility (despite legislation to encourage this). This leads to 1 in 3 baskets being abandoned, leaving an estimated 13 trillion up for grabs. One of the top issues is image alt text. This text is essential for making images accessible - however it isn’t always a priority when it comes to SEO strategy, due to the challenges of implementing it on a wider scale. This session walks you through easy, scalable alt text generation - an intuitive and easy to understand tutorial, with most of the heavy lifting already done for you. 2:20pm – Community Speaker – How True Leaders Transform a Marketing Department into a Dream Team Paxton Gray There are hidden, structural factors holding stellar marketers (and their teams) back‚ and it's not their fault. Discover what these factors are, how to root them out, and how to help your existing team members reach their potential. 2:45pm – Afternoon break 3:05pm – Myths, Misconceptions, & Mistakes (Lessons Learned from a Decade in Digital PR) Hannah Smith For more than 11 years, Hannah’s been tasked with coming up with content ideas that people will share and journalists will write about. In this session, she’ll be sharing some of the most important lessons she’s learned along the way. 3:40pm – E-Commerce SEO Horror Stories: How to tackle the most common issues at scale and avoid an SEO nightmare Aleyda Solis Between a dynamic inventory, complex categorization and filtering options, lack of unique product descriptions, and well-established global and local competitors, e-commerce sites are known to be amongst the most challenging types of sites when it comes to doing SEO, and often result in some pretty frightening horror story scenarios. But, it doesn't have to be that terrifying. In this session, Aleyda will take us through the most common issues, and show how to effectively address them at scale, before they become real nightmares. 4:30pm – Day 2 Presentations conclude Wednesday, July 13th 7:30am – Breakfast & registration 9:00am – Day 3 Opening Remarks 9:05am – Why Real Expertise is the Most Important Ranking Factor of Them All Lily Ray In this presentation, Lily will use real data to demonstrate how the rise of E-A-T has led to Google prioritizing expertise and authority above all else. 9:40am – You Need Audience Personas - Not Buyer Personas Amanda Natividad Traditional buyer personas help your marketing team make decisions and run campaigns for your ideal customers. But even when done right, buyer personas don't benefit half your marketing — the half that's not customer facing. In this presentation, Amanda will show why you should consider a suite of audience personas that supports a holistic business and marketing strategy. 10:20am – Morning break 10:40am – Rabbit Holes: How Google Pushes Us Down The Funnel Dr. Peter Meyers As an SEO, you've probably fallen down the rabbit hole of \"organic\" results that lead to more Google SERPs. If you map that rabbit hole, you'll see a systematic effort to push searchers down the funnel to commercial results. Why is Google doing this, what does it mean for SEO, and what can we learn about our own customers' journeys? 11:15am – Community Speaker – Beyond the Button: Tests that Actually Move the Needle Karen Hopper In a world that has a million different options for every creative element... where do you start? How do you know this or that element is where you'll see an impact big enough to make a difference for your bottom line? This is the number one question CRO strategists get asked, and the answer every time is: it depends! This session will walk through how to understand your testing opportunities, generate test ideas, and measure your results with scientific accuracy. 11:35am – Understanding Key Performance Factors: Using Data to Make Smart Decisions for Organic Search Joe Hall What KPIs are actually key? In this talk, Joe shows how organizations can use their own data to ascertain what’s relevant for actionable insights, in the hopes of helping you to develop smart SEO strategies. 12:15pm – Birds of a Feather lunch discussion tables 1:45pm – Leadership and Community in Search Marketing Strong Teams, Better Results Amalia Fowler As search marketers, we spend a lot of time optimizing our campaigns, but don't have the same time to put into nurturing our teams. This is especially true when faced with things like a global pandemic, the great resignation, increased competition and the whims of Google. It's easy to forget that taking purposeful action in our working relationships can help lead us to better results. In this practical and actionable talk, we'll bust the myth that you have to be a manager to have influence, discuss the importance of leadership and community, identify three key characteristics strong teams have in common, get tips on fostering those characteristics regardless of your role, and discuss how taking the time to do this serves all of us, clients included. 2:10pm – Community Speaker – Things I Learned from Sales Teams that Every SEO Should Know Petra Kis-Herczegh Whether you're trying to build a business case or get buy-in for your SEO project, some of the core challenges will come down to the same thing: How well can you sell it? As SEOs, we often forget that, even though we spend our day-to-day analyzing data and optimizing content and websites for bots, at the end of the day, we are working with human beings — and some of those people have decision-making power over what we can and can't achieve in our roles. This is where learning a good set of sales skills becomes crucial. In this talk, Petra will explore some of the key skills and methods sales teams use, and how you can apply these to your SEO work. 2:30pm – How Localized Content Can Double Your Link Earning Potential Amanda Milligan When we talk about digital PR and link earning, we often focus on national coverage, which is fantastic, of course. But local coverage (and the content that leads to it) is often neglected. In this presentation, Amanda will explain how brands can add localized content to their strategies in order to earn more media pickups and high-quality links. 3:10pm – Afternoon break 3:35pm – Community Speaker – Advanced On-Page Optimization Chris Long Take your on-page optimizations to the next-level using advanced tactics for one of the most common SEO tasks. This presentation goes beyond simply adding keywords. Chris will show you how to utilize tools such as IBM's Natural Language Understanding to find semantic entities of competitor pages, how Google's EAT guidelines apply to content, and what actionable steps you can take to improve content, perform on-page content experiments, and measure the impact of those tests. 3:55pm – Keyword Research for Thanks Instead of Ranks Wil Reynolds Seer Interactive has used keyword research methods to uncover ways to help clients understand their customers better. From diversity and inclusion, to hopes and fears, customers are leaving clues in their long tail searches. Wil demonstrates why you should spend the time to find them. 4:45pm – Day 3 Thank you & Farewell 7:00pm–10:00pm — Wednesday Night Bash Bowling: check! Karaoke: check! Photo booth: check! Join us for one last hurrah as we take over the Garage. You won't want to miss this closing night bash — we'll have plenty of games, food, and fun as we mix and mingle, say \"see ya soon\" to friends new and old, and reminisce over our favorite lessons from the past three days. See you there? Chatting with speakers, connecting with peers and potential partners in Birds of a Feather lunch tables, absorbing all the knowledge for another fruitful year of marketing... we can't wait to share it with you!
