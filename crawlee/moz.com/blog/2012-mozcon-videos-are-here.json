By: Rand Fishkin September 18, 2012 2012 #MozCon Videos Are Here Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. MozCon 2012 was amazing! This year, we opened the doors to about 800 attendees, including Moz Staff, and had a total of 29 presenters, including four very special community speakers. Feedback from attendees was phenomenal from kind words to thoughtful suggestions and ideas to make 2013 even better. One thing we strive for with MozCon is making sure that our content level challenges attendees (and us!) to learn something new or how to take a concept we already know and blow it out of the water. We want every attendee to go home with something to implement on their site. In our post-conference survey, we asked attendees about the level of our content: We want to make sure all our attendees are like the Goldilocks to our Baby Bear; they find our talks just right. We are also incredibly humbled that most MozCon attendees would recommend our conference to someone they know: Super exciting for us to see all the respondents who'd give MozCon a 10/10 to others interested. And now is the time you've been waiting for: the 2012 MozCon Video Bundle. You can stream every video from your computer or download it to your computer, tablet, or mobile device. Plus, you can download the slidedecks for every presentations so you don't have to worry about capturing URLs and all your notes can be focused ideas for your site(s). You'll be able to watch them at your leisure whether you're sitting at your desk, on an airplane, or chilling on your couch at home. What's in the 2012 MozCon Video Bundle? Included in the price ($299 for PRO members or $399 for non-PRO members) you’ll get: 29 videos (over 17 hours) from MozCon 2012 Stream or download the videos to your computer, iPhone, or Android device Downloadable PowerPoint slide-decks for the presentations For those looking for a taste of MozCon, we're releasing Wil Reynolds' talk, Beyond Link Building: Real Companies Do Real Things. Wil's talk was one of the highest-rated MozCon talks.
