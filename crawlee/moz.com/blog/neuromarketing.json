By: Rand Fishkin September 15, 2005 Neuromarketing Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Rather than ask samples of the population to watch ads and write their responses down, neuromarketing uses MRI scans to identify what types of brain activity correspond to different ad messages and promtional techniques. It's a new use for the science of examining brain waves that could have a big impact on the effectiveness of ads over the next few decades, particularly in the sphere of political advertising, where much of the focus was last year. The same techniques that apply to neuromarketing for TV and print ads could certainly be applied to the web. I foresee large stores like Amazon determining everything from the best related products to the optimal color scheme via brain scans - let's just hope that knowledge gets released in public studies so we can all be on the same playing field. It won't be fair if Landsend.com has a hypnotic pull to the checkout button while the rest of us sit in awe. Note: Not everyone thinks neuromarketing is a good thing. See Commercial Alert and Organic Consumers for some very strongly negative feelings on the issue. Copied! Back to Top",
