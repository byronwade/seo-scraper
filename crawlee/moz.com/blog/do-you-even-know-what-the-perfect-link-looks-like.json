By: Will Critchlow June 12, 2007 Do you even know what the perfect link looks like? Link Building This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. We got an opportunity today to get a practically perfect link for one of our clients and, because it prompted some discussion in our office, we thought we'd throw it out to wider discussion. It's not often you get whatever you want but this site has loads of great on-topic links, ranks for the target search, and we can have whatever link we want. So that's when the debate started. Would you rather have a single link from the homepage? Or a new page all about you (that obviously links to you) linked from the homepage? A sitewide link? The third option was rapidly discounted (used to be risky, now not effective, we believe). We are currently leaning towards a short paragraph on the homepage linking both to the client and a new page on the target site (that obviously links to the client as well), but we fancied throwing it out to a wider discussion. With the launch of the Q&A for premium members (which is awesome, by the way), we don't want to see a downturn in discussion here on YOUmoz and the main blog so let's get this conversation started. I'm also intrigued because I was reading about what could be the perfect link for some people earlier over on Marketing Pilgrim. Anyway, the call-to-action: let's have some discussion. I'm sure the consensus will be useful when people come across situations in the future when they have almost too much freedom! You've probably seen me commenting here before, but this is my first youmoz post. We also write about SEO and reputation monitoring / management at http://www.distilled.co.uk/blog Copied!
