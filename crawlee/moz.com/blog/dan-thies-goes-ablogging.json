By: Rand Fishkin April 13, 2006 Dan Thies Goes a-Blogging SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I can't believe I missed it, but as of last Friday, the SEO world's chief authority on KW Research, Dan Thies, has joined the blog ranks. His format is slightly different than most industry bloggers, providing tips and advice about the SEO process itself on a daily basis. From a recent post on title tags: Unless your brand name is especially valuable, you may be better off putting the company name last in the title tag, rather than first. If you're Amazon.com, you probably get a higher click-through rate from a title like \"Amazon - The Da Vinci Code : Books : Dan Brown.\" If you're Fred's Internet Book Emporium, you may want something like \"The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown - free shipping @ Fred's Books\" instead.
