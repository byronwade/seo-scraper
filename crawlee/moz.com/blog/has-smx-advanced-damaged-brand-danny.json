C By: Ciaran Norris June 7, 2007 Has SMX Advanced Damaged Brand Danny? SEO Events This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. This post will be short, and depending on the feedback it generates, so too could be my career in SEO. I mean seriously, questioning Danny Sullivan? The guy who has been around longer than Google? And is better liked too? It must be the jet-lag stopping me from thinking straight. Anyway.. With his first show since splitting from SES and the company he sold it too, Incisive Media, Danny promised sessions aimed at \"the experienced search marketer who wants to enjoy sessions conducted at a high-level and continue to stay ahead in the fast changing world of search\". On most of the sessions I would have to say that this promise wasn't reached. As has been said already in a variety of places, whilst many of the sessions were no more advanced than what you might find at an SES, the Q&A sessions often raised the bar slightly. But is that enough for an attendee to feel that they got good value for their money? Well that depends. I would suggest that there were broadly 3 types of people at SMX Advanced, and their feelings of satisfaction will depend on their situation. SEO Junkie: People who work in the sector, whether self-employed, in-house or agency, have advanced knowledge of SEO and are keen to meet new contacts, network, and build a profile. SEO Professional: Advanced level of knowledge, probably working in-house, not so fussed about the networking; need knowledge to make the time & expense of attending worthwhile. SEO Not So Advanced: People who could probably have done just as well at a standard SES event; level of knowledge not so advanced, but very interested in the sector. And how what would be the satisfaction levels of these groups? Not too bad at all. They may have picked up on or two little snippets of info in the sessions, but knew most of it already. But the parties, off-site conversations, and new relationships make this a worthwhile jaunt. But will they be able to come every year, or will it have to be a choice between SMX Advanced & one of the other established events? Not so great. The currency for these guys is knowledge, and they need to show ROI when they go back to their employers and explain what they got for (especially if they have come from overseas) several thousand dollars. Pretty chuffed. They have learned things they felt were advanced and will go away happy. I think that in order for this event & this brand to evolve & succeed Danny may have to work out how to satisfy the middle group; the ones who have enough knowledge that they could probably actually present an SES session, but who want to hone their business skills even more. But unless every session is like the Give It Up one which closed the show, I'm not sure how you do that. My guess though, is that Danny will probably figure out a way - let's just hope he does it soon. Copied! Back to Top",
