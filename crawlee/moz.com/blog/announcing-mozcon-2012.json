Frequent breaks were necessary to refresh our brains every few hours so we could cram more giant piles of information in.\" -- Heather Physioc Besides our programming, MozCon 2012 will give you the chance to meet face-to-face all the Mozzers you've been chatting with in the comments on this blog, in the answers on q&a, by email, customer service questions, or over Twitter. Grab an engineer and get a hint at a new SEOmoz product. Rickroll Jen in person, or ask Shelly about why someone drew her riding a unicorn on a whiteboard. And don't forget to hug Roger!
