By: Rand Fishkin June 13, 2005 SEO Browser Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Ian McAnerin & Anduro Technologies have put together a very clever and useful tool called the SEO Browser.

The plain text version of a site with only it's links to define it makes for a good experience and also gives great insight into the ease with which different content sections can be parsed out based on their phrasing and spacing. The browser also offers advanced functionality for a price (right now it's listed as $7-$249), but the site does not say what these additional features might be. Copied! Back to Top",
