V By: venice June 4, 2008 SEO Drink Buying Guide - Caffeine and Alcohol SEO Events This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. After attending only a few SEO events and conferences, it becomes apparent that search marketers like two things just about as much as they like links. Those two things are caffeine and alcohol, something you'll typically find in great abundance at your next search marketing event. Growing up in the food and beverage industry, it's been second nature for me to pay attention to what people prefer to drink. I began compiling a list a while back and decided recently to update that list using Twitter. The tweet was simple - what do you drink (from Starbucks)(from the hotel bar)? There's been a Starbucks in nearly every hotel or conference center I've been to, so I chose that for the caffeine category. Consider this list as an SEO beverage buying guide or a Search Marketer drink cheat sheet. Either way, you can use it to impress your colleagues and break the proverbial ice when reaching out to meet others in the industry. For those that reply to my tweets, I've included name, URL, twitter profile, and preferred caffeine and alcohol related beverages. Enjoy the list and may good times follow!
