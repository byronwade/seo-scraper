By: Rand Fishkin July 18, 2006 All the Things I Should Have Linked To Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Once again, I've fallen behind the times in blogging and haven't given proper respect to more than a few sites, pages and people who deserve it. Thus, this token attempt at absolution from the angry gods of the blogosphere: Todd Malicoat went line by line through that \"revealed\" Google ranking code and came away with some pretty good guesses. I doubt anyone could have done it better. Spotlight Sundays from Donna is a terrific idea. It's so good, I wish I could steal it (and I wish that I had time to blog on Sundays... or wait.... maybe I don't wish that). ISOS is back with a brand new product. It took them long enough, too. I think I've linked from my blog to more than 50% of their posts, now. Mr. Gray has some excellent link tips (to add to the pile we've been building lately). Andy Beal's firm released some darn cool data from their SEMLogic tool revealing what they believe to be the most important ranking factors. SEJournal covered it pretty well. Aaron's covering Caveman's posts on the latest Yahoo! update. I feel lucky that I just got to meet Caveman in person last week in San Francisco. We had a darn good time, too - fantastic Korean barbecue... mmmmm. Yay! We can opt out of those horrific ODP tags at both MSN & Google now. Last - someone told me that the SEO Rockstars podcast reaches 30,000 people per show. Is that true? Greg? Todd? If so... I really need to get on that bandwagon. Any big ones I missed? Copied!
