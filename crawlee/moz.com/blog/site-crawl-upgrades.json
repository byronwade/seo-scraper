Meyers September 12, 2017 Table of Contents Copied! By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers September 12, 2017 Announcing 5 NEW Feature Upgrades to Moz Pro's Site Crawl, Including Pixel-Length Title Data Moz Tools | Advanced SEO While Moz is hard at work on some major new product features (we're hoping for two more big launches in 2017), we're also working hard to iterate on recent advances. I'm happy to announce that, based on your thoughtful feedback and our own ever-growing wish lists, we've recently launched five upgrades to our Site Crawl. Check it out! 1. Mark Issues as FixedIt's fine to ignore issues that don't matter to your site or business, but many of you asked for a way to audit fixes or just let us know that you've made a fix prior to our next data update. So, from any issues page, you can now select items and \"Mark as fixed\" (screens below edited for content). Fixed items will immediately be highlighted and, like Ignored issues, can be easily restored... Unlike the \"Ignore\" feature, we'll also monitor these issues for you and warn you if they reappear. In a perfect world, you'd fix an issue once and be done, but we all know that real web development just doesn't work out that way. 2. View/Ignore/Fix More IssuesWhen we launched the \"Ignore\" feature, many of you were very happy (it was, frankly, long overdue), until you realized you could only ignore issues in chunks of 25 at a time. We have heard you loud and clear (seriously, Carl, stop calling) and have taken two steps. First, you can now view, ignore, and fix issues 100 at a time. This is the default – no action or extra clicks required. 3. Ignore Issues by TypeSecond, you can now ignore entire issue types. Let's say, for example, that Moz.com intentionally has 33,000 Meta Noindex tags (for example). We really don't need to be reminded of that every week. So, once we make sure none of those are unintentional, we can go to the top of the issue page and click \"Ignore Issue Type\": Look for this in the upper-right of any individual issue page. Just like individual issues, you can easily track all of your ignored issues and start paying attention to them again at any time. We just want to help you clear out the noise so that you can focus on what really matters to you. 4. Pixel-length Title Data For years now, we've known that Google cut display titles by pixel length. We've provided research on this subject and have built our popular title tag checker around pixel length, but providing this data at product scale proved to be challenging. I'm happy to say that we've finally overcome those challenges, and \"Pixel Length\" has replaced Character Length in our title tag diagnostics. Google currently uses a 600-pixel container, but you may notice that you receive warnings below that length. Due to making space to add the \"...\" and other considerations, our research has shown that the true cut-off point that Google uses is closer to 570 pixels. Site Crawl reflects our latest research on the subject.As with other issues, you can export the full data to CSV, to sort and filter as desired: Looks like we've got some work to do when it comes to brevity. Long title tags aren't always a bad thing, but this data will help you much better understand how and when Google may be cutting off your display titles in SERPs and decide whether you want to address it in specific cases. 5. Full Issue List Export When we rebuilt Site Crawl, we were thrilled to provide data and exports on all pages crawled. Unfortunately, we took away the export of all issues (choosing to divide those up into major issue types). Some of you had clearly come to rely on the all issues export, and so we've re-added that functionality. You can find it next to \"All Issues\" on the main \"Site Crawl Overview\" page: We hope you'll try out all of the new features and report back as we continue to improve on our Site Crawl engine and UI over the coming year. We'd love to hear what's working for you and what kind of results you're seeing as you fix your most pressing technical SEO issues. Find & fix your site issues now Copied! Back to Top",
