By: Rand Fishkin August 14, 2006 Monday Morning Roundup Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. After a week of being online less than an hour a day, there's a lot of news worthy of coverage around the industry. Let's take it from the top: I get lots of questions asking - \"how do I know if my site is news-worthy or link-worthy.\" The Time.com List of 50 Coolest Websites is a great place to get ideas about what the press considers deserving of attention. Think linkbait has to have immediate press? Think again - as my fellow SES panelist Neil Patel proves with his excellent comparison of analytics providers, which made Digg & Del.icio.us last week. Yahoo! queries on links are getting re-routed to Site Explorer. It's a smart move and a timely one, though I'm not yet seeing all of my requests go that way. The release of the AOL data last week caused quite a stir, particularly when the NYTimes did a bit of research to identify a woman, prompting some to speculate that laws could change in the near future. Luckily, some good also came of it, as Donna pointed out this nifty tool which uses the data to predict search query volume. My personal feeling is that companies like Yahoo! and Google shouldn't be storing this data after 90-120 days. As protected as they believe it might be, if the NSA comes to the door with a court order, any \"protection\" is null+void. Yahoo! Search Builder looks like its worth a peek, as does Eurekster, which I believe is a very cool service. I think the SEM industry is actually ripe for a vertical search like this. Barry's roundup of coverage from SES San Jose 2006 is up. It's always sad to me that he has to leave the sessions before the Q+A, though, as I find a lot of the best material during the last 20-30 minutes. Loren Baker makes a good case for Video being the future of Google, though I still think their core business will always be search and someone else (a YouTube or MetaCafe) will manage entertainment content and verticals more successfullly. This post from Mr. Cutts makes me really sad... And while we're on the topic - did anyone blog about Matt outing himself as GoogleGuy during SES? I believe his exact words were \"I backed into that position.\" Anything huge I missed this time? (there's probably a lot). Copied! Back to Top",
