By: Jennifer Sable Lopez August 4, 2012 Winners of #MozCation 2012 Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Whoa. Ever have one of those times where your expectations are completely blown out of the water? Well that's what happened during this year's nomination for a MozCation. Wait, wait, wait, before I get too far ahead of myself, I should explain what it is I'm talking about. Last month, we invited people from around the world to nominate their city for an SEOmoz Meetup. Once again, we were completely blown away by the way local communities were able to come together so quickly and show us how excited they were for us to come. Some people built and designed websites and Twitter accounts, others created videos or blog posts, and a couple even made infographics. You've all proven to us once again that our community rocks and that we need to work hard to keep up with all of you! I know, I know you want me to quit blabbing so you can see which cities we picked this year. Please know that it was a really tough decision, and we were overwhelmed by the amazing content created. Now, let's get down to business! And The Winners Are... Watch the video with Rand below to find out which cities we'll be visiting for a MozCation this year. :) Note: Please note, that not all the cities nominated were listed in the video. We just took a quick sampling of the cities submitted and listed them. Yay! Ok so I won't give it away, I want you to watch the video. :) But congratulations to the cities we'll be visiting! All The 2012 Nominations Please be sure to check out all the amazing nominations we had this year. We only gave folks two weeks to put something together, and as you can see, the nominations were absolutely amazing! A huge thank you to all the cities who participated!
