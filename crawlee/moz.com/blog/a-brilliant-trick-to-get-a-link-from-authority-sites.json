By: Rand Fishkin September 23, 2005 A Brilliant Trick to Get a Link from Authority Sites Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Using hex coding of a page's content, some clever folks have found a way to make it appear that they had links coming directly from high-level authority sites. Dannomatic at Threadwatch points this out: A series of pages are created on a domain say www.mylittlewebsite.com and the links point to a search request on one of these sites, example: copy the link url and paste to see what i mean, it's loooong- Notice the formatting using HEX code when surrounded by a standard HREF tag this translates the link properly when the request is made to the authority websites POST for search – the result is properly translated into basic html. This is a clever coding exploit, this format ensures the request is properly formatted in basic HTML. - Obviously the request is a negative search result on the authority website, however particularly site searches will cache all results of local searches, successful or otherwise.- If these search results are spiderable content, then a robot such as Googlebot will view the cache results and see inbound links from a high profile authority site point to the domain in question.- The result: www.mylittlewebsite.com jumps in the rankings. I love seeing exploits and tricks like this talked about in the open. It lets a whitehat (greyhat?) like me see deeper into the brilliant minds of those who manipulate to achieve rankings - a fascinating pursuit. Copied! Back to Top",
