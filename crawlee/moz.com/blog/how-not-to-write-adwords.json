Paid Search Marketing (PPC) The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. (Note from Rand: Tonight, I introduced Mystery Guest to the wonderful world of AdWords. Needless to say, she went a little wild. This one's just for fun, folks.) Rand asked me for some help with AdWords content. But I really don't know how to grab someone's attention in two lines. That is, without being really crass. So it got a little PG-13 in our apartment this afternoon, what with the liberal use of words like \"Viagra\" and \"Yo Mama\" jokes (the latter of which, quite tragically, did not make this post. They were a little too mean). So, obviously, we had some fun and goofed off, but I think we highlighted something fairly important (no, seriously, we did). In the end, it's sort of impossible to tell what works and what doesn't. You just need to try things out and see what Google accepts. And what's hilarious. And if you're lucky enough to find both? Well, you hang on to that Ad like Stinky Ivan to his mule. The ads that weren't approved: Rejected: No text on 2nd line Rejected: Use of \"pharmaceutical term\" Rejected: Use of banned term (\"Idiot\") Rejected: Infringement on copyright (use of term \"Google\") And some ads that Google, shockingly, approved: Note from Rand: Next week, we will try to put together some blog posts on AdWords optimization (and after that, dive into Panama & AdCenter, too). BTW - Please do share your favorite AdWords ads in the comments. We'd love to see them. UPDATE: I'm really tired tonight, so no 2am blog posts, but do check out this post from Adam Doppelt of Gurge on how Yahoo! Slurp misbehaves - really interesting stuff. Also, Brian White has a good tip on how to send search queries through email without confusing the recipient and Vanessa has 6 great questions for Facebook. I'm with you, Neil, she really should be more popular with the social media crowd? Copied! Back to Top",
