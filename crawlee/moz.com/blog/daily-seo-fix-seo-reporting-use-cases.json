By: Meghan Pahinui February 11, 2022 Daily SEO Fix: SEO Reporting — More Specific Use Cases Moz Tools | SEO Reporting When rolling out an SEO strategy, an important step is to establish goals you’re able to report on regularly. With Custom Reports in Moz Pro, you have the ability to set up automatic reports to send to key stakeholders regarding the goals you are seeking to achieve. In the previous Daily Fix edition we talked through the basics of creating reports. This time, we’ll dive deeper into some specific use cases that may help you and your team better relay critical information regarding your SEO goals and objectives. Start Your Moz Pro Free Trial Use Case: Rankings Opportunities Staying on top of rankings opportunities and how your site stacks up against your competitor may be a critical piece in your SEO strategic puzzle. In this video, Varad will walk through how you can further supplement the existing Rankings Opportunities template. This report will offer ongoing insight into possible opportunities to tackle next. Use Case: Competitive Analysis Setting up a competitive analysis report can help you answer questions from clients and team members regarding how they are performing next to their competitors. This is a common question when working in SEO and having a report ready to go can help set you up for success! In this next video, Meghan will go over the Custom Report template for competitive analysis and how you can further segment data to bolster your reporting efforts. If you need help determining who your competitors are, be sure to check out the True Competitor tool. Use Case: Site Audit If you are in charge of the technical SEO for your site, or your client’s site, you will likely be asked to regularly report on what issues you’ve resolved and what you’re currently working on. Moz’s Custom Report templates offer a variety of options for Site Audit reports which can help you stay on top of issues and better communicate with interested parties. You can even add in data from the Performance Metrics part of Site Crawl which reports on a tracked site’s Core Web Vitals performance. Emilie will go over the different options available for Site Audit reports and how to add in that Core Web Vitals data. Use Case: Traffic Reporting If increasing organic traffic to your site or to a specific page on your site is one of your goals, it can be helpful to have a report set up to regularly send you updates in a digestible format. With Google Analytics connected to your Moz Pro Campaign, you can create traffic-related reports in the Custom Reports section. In this next video, Christy will go over which modules you can add to your report so you’re able to keep tabs on organic traffic right alongside your other Campaign data.
