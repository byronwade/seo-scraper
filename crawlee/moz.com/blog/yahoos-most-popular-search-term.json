Search Engines By: Rand Fishkin May 12, 2006 The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin May 12, 2006 Yahoo!'s Most Popular Search Term? Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Why, it's the same as MSN's... \"Google.\" But, Yahoo! is fighting back by placing a Yahoo! search box at the top of the SERPs on a Google search: I really do feel bad for Yahoo! on this issue. I can't imagine how frustrating it must be for Yahoo!'s engineers to endure search logs that are filled with \"Google\", \"Google search\", \"search Google\" and the occassional \"myspace\" or \"Jessica Simpson\"... I can see how that might get old very fast. I'd love to know how effective that \"onebox\" result is... Can anyone from Yahoo! comment? Copied! Back to Top",
