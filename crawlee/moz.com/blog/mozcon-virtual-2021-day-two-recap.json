Table of Contents Copied! By: Colan Nielsen July 14, 2021 Day Two Learnings From the Three-Ring MozCon Circus SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Day one of MozCon Virtual gave us a great start to this year‚Äôs conference ‚Äì from surviving the COVID news agenda, to the science of purchasing power, to game-changing ways to use the Google Search Console API. If day one was a preview of things to come, I knew we were all in for a treat as we headed into day two! With that said, day two has arrived! Me, rolling into #MozCon Day 2. I'll need to catch up on Day 1 in the recordings.

Dance breaks are not just okay at #MozCon, but encouraged. üíÉ Make sure you take some time to get out of your chair and dance it out to our MozCon playlist: https://t.co/srXl8pm8gZ‚Äî Moz (@Moz) July 13, 2021 Ross Simmonds ‚Äì Why Marketers Should Think More Like Investors To Drive Content Results In this session, Ross talked about the parallels between content marketing/SEO and the world of investing. I am a lover of analogies, so I was excited to see how Ross was going to show us how an investment mindset can be applied to content marketing and SEO. As someone who loves SEO, and investing, I was pumped for this one. Ross began by telling a story about his investment in General Motors stock. He put a lot of money into the stock‚Ä¶and it crashed. Ross had not done enough research into GM before making his investment. The lesson: you need to invest time into doing your homework! You need to understand the market before you jump in. The same applies to SEO. We all hope that our investments will deliver a return, but in 2020 we were all tested during the pandemic. Many companies put the investment of SEO on pause...and that was a mistake. Even during a recession, people still have a strong desire for content and information. As Ross explained, every piece of content you create is an asset, and to see the most from our investments, we need to ‚Äúinvest more ‚Äî guess less‚Äù. There are so many types of content you can create but it's so important to recognize the risk and reward for each type of content. üí∏What is your goal? What kind of return do you want?\"Invest more, guess less\" ‚Äî @TheCoolestCool #MozCon pic.twitter.com/cQU0g1DdXM‚Äî Elizabeth Linder üåª (@Its_Liz_Linder) July 13, 2021 Content presents money printing capabilities, and major companies are starting to realize this. @TheCoolestCool is showing us why content marketers should think more like investors. Genius. #MozCon pic.twitter.com/vxUmOp48Bv‚Äî Tiffany Gilkey (She/Her) (@TiffanyLG23) July 13, 2021 Needless to say, Ross left us all wanting to diversify our content portfolios!

With a focus on aggregators and classifieds, Areej shared advice on how to best reduce index bloat for large websites. Love listening to @areej_abuali talk about the ultimate head-scratcher in SEO: where to draw the line between which pages should/should not be indexed on very largescale sites where many URLs risk not being crawled/indexed.Tip: focus on actual business KPIs!#MozCon pic.twitter.com/1UXi2f6Bht‚Äî Lily Ray üòè (@lilyraynyc) July 13, 2021 She acknowledged that, while we are fully in control of how Google crawls and indexes our site, it can feel scary! \"It's okay to feel overwhelmed when working on something new...\" I love how open and honest @areej_abuali is - ALWAYS.

Let‚Äôs ‚Äúdrop the 100-page audit!‚Äù. Websites do not (and most probably should not) need to have every single page indexed. Instead, focus on indexing pages that have the potential to provide good search results. Honestly, there were so many amazing insights from this presentation, this is one you‚Äôll want to revisit!

Joy Hawkins dove headfirst into the data from two studies to answer these questions. Joy opened up by sharing a Mario Kart analogy. Joy is a super competitive person. She shared how she followed a similar approach for this study as she did when she was working towards beating Dave DiGregorio at Mario Kart. Let‚Äôs just say that it required a lot of research, tracking, and analysis.

Here are the types of Google Posts that Joy analyzed: Offer PostsCOVID PostsEvent PostsUpdate Posts Joy also summarized the worst-performing post types. And the winners are: ReviewsSeasonal/HolidayProducts (or services)Who We Are (bios)Study #2 The second study looked at whether posting on Google has any influence on where your business ranks in the local pack. The conclusion? Google Posts had no measurable impact on rankings.

What the heck?! My presentation has already been recorded...why am I still nervous? üò¨ It's not too early for a beer right... #MozCon‚Äî Casie Gillette (@Casieg) July 13, 2021 In her presentation, Casie looked at content from an entirely different perspective and talked about how you can start creating content on your own terms, because really, there's no one way to do content marketing. According to Casie, counterintuitive marketing is ‚Äúthe idea of bucking trends to do what is right for YOUR site‚Äù. Casie showed that more content is NOT always best. Sometimes optimizing existing content can be far more powerful than creating new content. @Casieg #mozcon the effects of optimizing existing content and adding more CTAs throughout the site: pic.twitter.com/7x8lvm8yUB‚Äî Noah Learner (He/Him) (@noahlearner) July 13, 2021 There is no one size fits all solution to content marketing.
