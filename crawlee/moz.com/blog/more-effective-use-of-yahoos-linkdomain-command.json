By: Rand Fishkin October 21, 2005 More Effective Use of Yahoo's Linkdomain Command Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. As much as I think site explorer is a great idea, in practice, it's still not as useful as Yahoo!'s normal linkdomain command. There are some fantastic features in there that I use all the time, for example: Removing sites from the list as in a search for linkdomain:seomoz.org -site:seomoz.org (note that you can use this to remove multiple site if you have a few sitewides dominating the results)_ Searching only a particular site for links as in linkdomain:seomoz.org site:blogspot.com_ Using specific terms when searching as in linkdomain:seomoz.org msn interview (this can be particularly useful if you want to see whether your links are from generally on topic pages or to roughly check anchor text)_ Using specific terms, as above, to check for the presence of competitors on those link pages as in linkdomain:seomoz.org seobook.com (note that I don't use site:, just the term)_ Using specific terms to see how many links come from a forum or blog as in linkdomain:seomoz.org thread reply forum (this won't show you all the links unless you click the \"show more results\" at the end)_ Speaking of the \"end\" of Yahoo's results, going to page 999 on a linkdomain search can be very revealing. For example, for a site like wikipedia.org, the 999th page shows some real, valuable links from real pages - that's telling me that Wikipedia really has that many valuable, high quality links. The reason I can ascertain that is by looking at what the 999th page usually looks like for sites like online-poker.com (I just made that up, so I hope it doesn't belong to someone here) or even our client Avatar (who has mostly spammy scrapers listed at that level). Linkdomain is a powerful command and its uses are even more varied than those I've listed above. Try for yourself and see what you can find - there's no better source of link information currently available on the web. Copied! Back to Top",
