By: Scott Willoughby May 25, 2007 Whiteboard Friday: \"Digg-Dugg\" The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Okay, okay, last week's Whiteboard Friday was a bit frivolous (although I gave you all fair warning before you clicked play). This week we've tried to give you a bit more signal and a little less noise with the on-screen debut of our very own Digg Guru, Matt Inman. Matt's as close to a professional Digger as you can be while still having a life and getting other work done (no offense, Neil), so he's here to share a few up-to-date tips and tricks for building successful, Digg-targeted content.Happy Friday everyone and, to those of you in the US, enjoy the long weekend!This week's musical guest is Mudvayne performing Dig (Everything & Nothing Mix).
