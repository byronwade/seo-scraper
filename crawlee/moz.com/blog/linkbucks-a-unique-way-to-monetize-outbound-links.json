By: Rand Fishkin November 8, 2006 LinkBucks - A Unique Way to Monetize Outbound Links Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I have to say that I'm rarely impressed by new ideas in website monetization, but Linkbucks, as a concept, is fairly revolutionary. The idea is that Linkbucks will display ads on the websites and pages you link to - check out their site for more. They answered a few of my initial questions on the homepage: Currently we pay you $1 US for every 5000 top banner ad impressions, and $1 US for every 3500 intermission ad impressions. This tells me there's the option to display a banner on the page you link to, or the option to use interstitial-style pages, which pay out more (but are undoubtedly more annoying for users). The problems are inherent - your users are suffering through additional advertising for using your site as a reference point. However, some might claim that it's better than showing ads on your own site, and I have little doubt that there are some fairly spammy ways to abuse this network (I note that the site already only counts clicks from certain countries). If anyone's given this service a shot and has experience, I'd be thrilled to hear your take. Copied! Back to Top",
