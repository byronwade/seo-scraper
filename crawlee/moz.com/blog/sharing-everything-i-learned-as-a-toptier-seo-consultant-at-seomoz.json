Table of Contents Copied! By: Danny Dover March 17, 2011 Sharing Everything I Learned As A Top-Tier SEO Consultant at SEOmoz Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Prepare to stay out late, polish your dancing shoes and crank up the music. Today, I am very excited to announce that after almost two years, my book explaining everything I know about SEO is finally publicly available! And the crowd goes wild! A Bit of Background: For the past two years I have been working on an SEO resource that I hoped would help level the knowledge playing field in the SEO community. I am very excited to share that it is finally available! I wrote an extremely comprehensive book titled SEO Secrets that literally explains everything I know about SEO. All of it. The good, the bad, the embarrassing and the ugly. (The last two being my self-portrait on the back cover.) Starting today, you can read all of the knowledge, skills and secrets that I learned during my three years at SEOmoz. This includes all of the processes, paperwork and experiences that the team here used while doing SEO consulting for many of the world's top brands. Cue logo marquee! (Disney, Comcast, Microsoft, Yelp, Facebook, Etsy, etc...). Isn't Sharing ALL of Your SEO Secrets a Little Overzealous? While at SEOmoz, I was Lead SEO. Today, I work as the Senior SEO Manager at AT&T. Since these are both in-house SEO jobs, I am in the very unique situation that I can tell the world the valuable secrets I had learned about SEO consulting without it negatively affecting my career or my company. This translates to money in the bank for you! But Aren't There Already Books About SEO? After I got this book deal (What. Up.), the first thing I did was read every SEO book that was out there. I learned what I found useful and what was poorly disguised fluff. I quickly realized that if I was going to write a book that I would actually want to read, I would need to focus on making all of its content actionable. I spent several months asking hundreds of different SEOs (that includes many of you!) what they would want to read. I spent the following year and a half writing those answers. Based on my research and the feedback from many of you, I made sure the book answered the following questions: How do SEO professionals do link building? What paperwork do I need to keep myself protected? What metrics should I use for measurement? How do you land your first major SEO client? How much should I charge for SEO services? How do I get speaking gigs? How do I effectively work in large organizations? What are the best practices for on-page and off-page SEO? How do I build my personal SEO brand? And more! I was maniacal about documenting each step of the SEOmoz SEO consulting process and developed mental models and diagrams to help explain in written form not only what we did but how we did it. All of this information is clearly laid out in SEO Secrets. I am happy to say that I am very proud of how this work turned out. It is the SEO manual that I wish I had had when I was learning SEO. It is actionable, detailed and answers the hard questions that most SEOs are afraid to divulge. I learned a lot from working with these companies and I learned a lot from all of you. Now I want to give back. SEO Secrets is globally available and you can order it today from most of your favorite book retailers. or learn more on Amazon.co.uk What about e-versions? Don’t worry, my publisher is working through the tricky worlds of Kindle, iBooks and Nook versions of the book. I’ll have an announcement on my bucket list blog about the topic in the coming weeks. Good luck and happy SEOing! Copied! Back to Top",
