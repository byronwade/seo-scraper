J By: Jeff Pollard December 19, 2006 5 Tips for Hiding Your Email Address from Spammers Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I've been doing work on a website for one of our clients, and I noticed they followed a trend with their email address that I've seen a lot. They were getting lots of spam at their contact email address, i.e. contact@company.com, so they replaced it with contact2@company.com as a last ditch method to stop the avalanche of spam.While this works, it doesn't get to the root of the problem: if your email address is on the internet, spammers will get it. But with that being said, there are a few tactics you can use to slow down your intake of spam. Most of them are very simple, and take only a few seconds of your time. Choose non-generic email addressesI've run far too many domains and email addresses to not notice that if you have a contact@mydomain.com, spammers will try to send email to it -- even if you don't have it set up. So don't set it up! Use more creative addresses such as helpme@mydomain.com, or contactdomain@mydomain.com. Don't have a \"catch-all\" email addressYou may also have a \"catch-all\" email address in place, so emails sent to any address @mydomain.com will show up in your inbox anyways. Turn that off too. Spammers will more than happily send email to generic/random addresses @mydomain.com, in hopes of scoring a hit. Don't let that happen. Don't use your email for the domain registrationIf you register a domain name and use your email address for the registrant, administrative and/or technical contact email, you're just asking to get spam. Yes, some sites like DNSStuff.com will censor your email address from a WHOIS request. Yet still others, like Whois.net, won't. Also, you can usually pay for a \"unlisted\" domain registration, what will keep your contact info private. Use online forms for email communicationIf you have the technical ability, allow your website visitors to contact you via email using an online form. That way, the form sends the email to you and the visitor has no idea what address it's sending it to. But be careful, online mail forms are tricky and can be subject to code injection. This can lead to your sever actually sending out spam. Encrypt your email addressIf you must have your email address live on the web, don't just use a simple mailto: link -- you can encode it using JavaScript. That way a web browser can display it correctly, but a spammer trying to scrape your site won't be able to read it. Note: the spammer still may be able to extract your email address from the HTML code, but using this method makes it a lot harder.To do this, I'd recommend any one of the free online tools. My personal favorite is Mailto Encoder. Just use their system, fill in some variables, and you're done. For instance, rather than have the usual mailto link, mailto:user@mydomain.com, you insert some custom JavaScript that builds your address dynamically for you.
