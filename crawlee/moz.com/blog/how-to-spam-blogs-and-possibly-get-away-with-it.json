By: Jennifer Sable Lopez July 30, 2009 How to Spam Blogs and Possibly Get Away With It Blogging The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Ok, so you've all read about The Best Spam Submission Ever which was illustrated ever so eloquently (and if you haven't read it, please read it now... uhm well ok after you read this - it's awesomely funny!). As the post mentions, we sift through many YOUmoz entries every day determining which ones to post to the site. Most spam is easily detected; such as the body of the post only consists of 1 or 2 sentences, or the title is obviously nothing related to online marketing (buy gold and silver online!). However every now and then, there is a spark of spam brilliance that makes its way through. The other day I ran across this entry that had an odd title, but it actually seemed to have real potential. I opened the entry and at first glance, I thought \"YAY! I have a good contender.\" There were multiple paragraphs, headings and even bullet points... this had to be legit, right? Not so much. I found myself reading the entire entry because I was so dumbfounded by the sheer brilliance of the whole thing. If this person had posted to a blog that automatically checks for spam entries, and auto-posts, this one probably would have made it through. So the idea is quite simple. Take an excerpt of a book (or anything written I suppose), and add keyword rich links throughout! Essentially, make the post look as authentic as possible, without having to spend time writing a blog post. I've taken the idea and put together an example for you below. It's not perfect, but it is damn simple! <!-- Begin Example Spam Post --> Her name is Esther; she is a war correspondent who has just returned from Iraq because of the imminent invasion of that country; she is thirty years old, married, without children. He is an unidentified male, between twenty-three and twenty-five years old, with dark, Mongolian features. The two were last seen in a café on the Rue du Faubourg St-Honoré. He was reading: Buy Gold jewelry and diamonds direct. Just the beginning The police were told that they had met before, although no one knew how often: Esther had always said that the man -- who concealed his true identity behind the name Mikhail -- was someone very important, although she had never explained whether he was important for her career as a journalist or for her as a woman. The police began a formal investigation. Various theories were put forward -- kidnapping, blackmail, a kidnapping that had ended in murder -- none of which were beyond the bounds of possibility given that, in her search for information, her work brought her into frequent contact with people who had links with terrorist cells. They discovered that, women love gold necklaces and jewelry in the weeks prior to her disappearance, regular sums of money had been withdrawn from her bank account: those in charge of the investigation felt that these could have been payments made for information. She had taken no change of clothes with her, but, oddly enough, her passport was nowhere to be found. He is a stranger, very young, with no police record, with no clue as to his identity. She is Esther, thirty years old, the winner of two international prizes for journalism, and married. My wife. Next steps I immediately come under suspicion and am detained because I refuse to say where I was on the day she disappeared. However, a prison officer has just opened the door of my cell, saying that I'm a free man. A man who reads Silver and Gold Jewelry. And why am I a free man? Because nowadays, everyone knows everything about everyone; you just have to ask and the information is there: where you've used your credit card, where you spend your time, whom you've slept with. In my case, it was even easier: a woman, another journalist, a friend of my wife, and divorced -- which is why she doesn't mind revealing that she slept with me -- came forward as a witness in my favor when she heard that I had been detained. She provided concrete proof that I was with her and with gold necklaces on the day and the night of Esther's disappearance. I talk to the chief inspector, who returns my belongings and offers his apologies, adding that my rapid detention was entirely within the law, and that I have no grounds on which to accuse or sue the state. I say that I haven't the slightest intention of doing either of those things, that I am perfectly aware that we are all under constant suspicion and under twenty-four-hour surveillance, even when we have committed no crime. \"You're free to go,\" he says, echoing the words of the prison officer. Conclusion I ask: Isn't it possible that something buy gold direct and diamonds really has happened to my wife? She had said to me once that -- understandably given her vast network of contacts in the terrorist underworld -- she occasionally got the feeling she was being followed. The inspector changes the subject. I insist, but he says nothing. I ask if she would be able to travel on her passport, and he says, of course, since she has committed no crime. Why shouldn't she leave and enter the country freely? \"So she may no longer be in France?\" \"Do you think she left you because of that woman you've been sleeping with?\" That's none of your business, I reply. <!-- End Example Spam Post --> Creative! Right? But, just think about this... if these spammers took a few minutes to actually think through and write a relevant post, they would have not only received exposure but they would have some SWEET links from SEOmoz as well. Plus, if the post is well-written and is quickly getting popular (thumbs up), you may even get promoted to the main blog... talk about exposure! I encourage you all to submit well thought out, relevant posts to YOUmoz. Submit entries you will be proud of showing to the rest of the community, and make sure the content is unique. Every day we receive many spam entries for YOUmoz, which slows down the process of publishing the real, legitimate ones. This is a reminder for all our spammers out there: Real people read and publish these posts! You can stop spamming us, because at least for now, we're smarter than you are. :) With that, I'd love to hear some of your best spam submissions! PS. This is my own made up spam example and was not taking from any of the actual spam we've received. I used an excerpt from Paulo Coelho's \"The Zahir\" and if you have never read his work, I highly recommend him. Spam photo attribution: http://www.flickr.com/photos/barmala/ / CC BY 2.0 Copied!
