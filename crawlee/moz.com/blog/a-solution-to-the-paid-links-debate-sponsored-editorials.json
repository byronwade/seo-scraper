By: Rand Fishkin December 4, 2007 A Solution to the Paid Links Debate - Sponsored Editorials Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Today at Pubcon, I'm speaking on the Link Buying Panel, but here on the blog, you're getting a sneak peak at one of my topics for the presentation. It's my feeling that we (search engines and search marketers) have hit some intransigence on the paid links debate. The marketplace has to exist - and search engine have to fight against what they perceive to be manipulative, non-editorial votes. But, what if there was a solution that could make both sides happy? A place where money changed hands between parties, but editorial decisions still came into play? I'm calling this idea \"Sponsored Editorials.\" The concept is simple: Create a marketplace where those seeking to have their web-based content reviewed, written about and possibly linked-to can connect with website and blog owners interested in earning money off their investment of a review Buyers (who want their content reviewed) pay up front. Reviewers get paid to review the content, whether they write about it (or link to it) or not. If the reviewers like the content, they can use a nofollow link to tell search engines that they're not editorially endorsing it. If the reviewers LOVE the content, they can remove the nofollow and editorially endorse the content. Here's a couple graphics for those who prefer visuals: _ _ The idea isn't perfect, but I think it has some potential, and I'd be thrilled to participate in a system that essentially rewards content creators and reviewers precisely how the engines might intend. Naturally, feedback is welcome - constructive is preferable, but critical is fine, too, of course. I'm not sure if this a project that SEOmoz would take on (though our new marketplace would be a fun place to give it a spin), but I certainly hope that in freely sharing the idea, it can grow and become even more valuable and interesting.
