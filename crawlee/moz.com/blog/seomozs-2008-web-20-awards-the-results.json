By: Jane Copland May 27, 2008 SEOmoz's 2008 Web 2.0 Awards: The Results Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. To quote our fantastic CTO Jeff Pollard, we're live. 2008's Web 2.0 Awards are finally complete. SEOmoz's first Web 2.0 Awards launched two years ago, and today we've finished compiling, ranking and awarding hundreds of websites across forty-one categories for the 2008 version. We've added new categories and removed outdated ones. We've also again teamed with a great group of bloggers, marketers, and web-based business people who acted as our voting panel. I needn't go into too much detail in this blog post, as the Awards' zeitgeist explains the details of what happened this year, including some things we feel have changed with the concept and understanding of \"Web 2.0.\" This is the third installment of the Web 2.0 Awards and this is the first year we've awarded real prizes to the winners (aside from the badges we've always provided). This year, we'll be sending customised Jones Soda bottles to the sites that won first place. In debating what sort of prizes would be best for something like the Web 2.0 Awards, we decided to go for an unconventional option. It seemed only appropriate for websites which, by their definition, should be unconventional. Our latest New Guy (there's one every week or so) Timmy Christensen has designed some fantastic labels for the bottles. Here's the label for the Music winner, Last.fm. We've also received eleven interview responses from winning sites, including Last, Google Blog Search, Zillow, and a couple of other great companies. A select few have also treated us to a look inside their offices, which for me is always interesting. A big thanks go our to all our judges and to Jeff and Rand, who've put a lot of effort into the Awards as well. And yes, this is the point at which you can start nominating sites for next year!
