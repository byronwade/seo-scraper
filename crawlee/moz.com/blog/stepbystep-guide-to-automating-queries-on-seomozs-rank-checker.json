S By: stephen-15402 July 18, 2007 Step-by-step guide to automating queries on SEOmozâ€™s Rank Checker SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Want to check where a website ranks for multiple keywords at the touch of a button? This guide will show you step-by-step how you can extend the functionality of SEOmoz's Rank Checker. Register at SEOmoz or buy premium membership if you haven’t already. Download and install the iMacros extension for Firefox. Save the Conversion Factory file to your desktop. Open it up in Notepad to take a look - we’re checking where www.google.com ranks for three keywords: ‘Google’, ‘search engine’ and ‘search engine optimisation’. In Firefox, click the iMacros icon to open the iMacros toolbar. Click on the Rec tab, then Load. Browse to ranks.iim on your desktop. It'll load it as #Current.iim into the iMacros toolbar. Browse to SEOmoz and make sure you’re logged in. On the iMacros toolbar, click on the Play tab, then choose #Current.iim and click Play. The macro will check then the ranks for all three keywords automatically: Want to customise the macro? Just open it up in Notepad, then... Change the URL - replace www.google.com with your URL. E.g. TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ACTION:/rank-checker ATTR=ID:WhereRankUrl CONTENT=www.seomoz.com Change the keywords - replace the keywords with your own, or copy and paste the following lines to add more. Remember to include <SP> between words and make sure there aren't any empty lines in the code. E.g. to check for 'rand fishkin' add these two lines: TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ACTION:/rank-checker ATTR=ID:WhereRankKeyword CONTENT=rand<SP>fishkin TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=ACTION:/rank-checker ATTR=ID:submit_button&&VALUE:Check<SP>Rankings Download the CSV automatically - add these lines to the end of the macro to download the CSV file to your desktop. Again, make sure there aren’t any empty lines in the macro. TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:My<SP>Archived<SP>Rankings ONDOWNLOAD FOLDER=* FILE=+_{{!NOW:yyyymmdd_hhnnss}} TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Download<SP>as<SP>CSV Hope this saves you some time!
