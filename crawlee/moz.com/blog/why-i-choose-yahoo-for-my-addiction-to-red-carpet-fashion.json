N By: NathaniaJohnson February 27, 2007 Why I Choose Yahoo for My Addiction to Red Carpet Fashion Search Engines This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I'm an awards show junkie, and therefore, whenever a show is televised, I'm glued - to the internet. Though the awards themselves are either a little self-congratulatory or politically-driven, it's the fashion that piques my interest. Yahoo is my engine of choice for live fashion tracking. Photos of the stars are updated frequently after the limousines arrive. This enables me to compile a list of my favorites and \"what were they thinking?\" which I email to my fashion-forward friends. Later on, I compile my personal picks for my personal blog. Even though Yahoo has a decent entertainment section, which is prominently displayed on the home page on the night of awards ceremonies, I actually use the news section for my frock frolicking. I then type in something like \"academy awards source:yahoo\" which results in a list of articles, press releases, and photos - perfect for play-by-play tracking. It's not a perfect fit for fabulous fashionistas. The one thing I'd really love included with the captions is what designer the gals are wearing! I can turn to E! or Style.com or Elle for that, but the results are slower (though slowly getting better.) And I don't know why it's taken me so long, but next time I'll be trying a new method to my madness - tracking everything by RSS. Copied! Back to Top",
