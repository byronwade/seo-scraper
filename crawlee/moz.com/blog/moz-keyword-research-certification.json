By: Emilie Martin November 1, 2022 Announcing the Keyword Research Certification: Create a Personalized Keyword Strategy Keyword Research | Moz News The heart of your SEO. The foundation for building ideas and thoughts in your industry. The vital link between you and your audience. What are we talking about? Keywords, of course! Keyword research is a fundamental aspect of any SEO strategy, so it’s important to know why you should do it, and how you should go about it. The power of keyword research lies in better understanding your target market and how they are searching for your content, services, or products. Too many people bypass this crucial planning step because keyword research takes time, and why spend the time when you already know what you want to rank for? The answer is that what you want to rank for and what your audience actually wants are often two completely different things. Focusing on your audience and using keyword data to your advantage will make for much more successful campaigns than if you were to focus on the typical desirable keywords.
