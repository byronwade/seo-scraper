By: Rand Fishkin October 18, 2005 Dilbert on User Interface Design Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Scottie Claiborne, who co-authors the hilarious ISOS blog and who bought me lunch on her last trip into Seattle, delivers this stellar work of art at a forum thread at HighRankings.
