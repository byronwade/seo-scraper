By: Joseph Tamargo October 12, 2007 How SEOmoz Changed My Life Mobile SEO This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I wanted to make a blog post to let everyone know a little about how much I like SEOmoz! I have been reading SEOmoz for some time now and like many people here, I just started becoming more active (comments and this blog post.) I read many blogs a day and I figured that I should start posting and commenting more on these blogs so that other people that are new, landing somewhere for the first time, can see how some of these blogs can really help them. Now that I am done with that really long into, I will tell you why I named my post title the way I did. It was actually a video that changed my life forever. Firstly, let me recount some of the things that SEOmoz did for me, and then I will tell you what video inspired me forever. The Blog: This blog is REAL, there is no BS--the staff keeps it BS and spam free. The posts are out of this world and stuffed with real world info, not all that \"Hey, I will recap what others said\" kind of posts that you see everywhere else. Ease & Usability: This website is uber sleek and designed to get you where you want to go in milliseconds. There is none of that \"Did you mean\" or \"How about this\" that you see on some sites. The pages are all clear, they are well formatted, and \"spot on\" with the content being 100% unique and educational. They never try to sell me anything. The Staff and Response to the Users: This is an area where SEOmoz truly kicks ass. I have emailed Rand several times about several different topics and issues I had. My most recent being about my login info, and you know what? Every time I emailed Rand or the staff, they responded in less then 12 hours. I mean, come on, that's just unheard of in this industry! I have emailed some \"bloggers\" or \"industry professionals\" and they never email me back. Never ever, no matter how many times I email them, they just never write back. This shows me how professional the SEOmoz people really are. If they respond to my every email without me even being a Premium Member, I could just imagine how they treat their clients and Premium members. Whiteboard Friday: (This was the life changer for me) When I first started watching Whiteboard Friday, I was hooked from the first time I hit that play button. Rand is always clear and to the point, the videos are not stuffed with ads, and the whole approach is no holds barred with no fear about pissing people off. That's awesome, we need more people like Rand to take stand and spit it out like it's supposed to be said, not candy coated with all this fluff crap. And the WINNER is this video, Whiteboard Friday - State of the Industry. He looks at how the industry is made up, who does what, and what questions you should ask yourself to see where you fit in. This is what changed my life and my whole career path. I have been a web developer for about four years, doing everything from creating websites to coding some cool stuff of my own. My main business was and still is swimming pools: I have been a swimming pool tech for seventeen years and did the development in my spare time. However, after watching this video, I realized that I was going down the wrong road. Instead of developing websites for other people I decided to take everything that I have learned from Rand and staff and apply it to my one passion in life, which is swimming pools. The Conclusion: Reading SEOmoz has been not only the best educational experience I have ever had on the web, but it has now totally changed my life and given my family so much more then we could have ever wanted. The only things you will ever need to be an successful website owner is SEOmoz, a computer, and a dream! (oh, and maybe hosting ). Thanks for letting me share! Copied! Back to Top",
