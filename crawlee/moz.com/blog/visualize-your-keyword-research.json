By: Matt Redford January 3, 2012 Visualize Your Keyword Research SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. In early 2010 I shared a keyword tool I developed called Keyword Eye here on SEOmoz. I received some great feedback as a result of doing that. It's changed quite a bit since then, it had a major revamp, there were ups and downs, trials and tribulations, so thought I'd take this opportunity to share it again with readers who may remember the original post and new readers alike. What is Keyword Eye? It's a visual keyword suggestion tool. You simply enter a keyword, define regional search engine, choose ordering type and it will return a cloud of related keyword suggestions (it now also includes data for the exact keyword searched for amongst the related keywords). The size of the keyword reflects average search volume per month and colour represents how competitive it is (using PPC data). Red is high competition, amber is medium and green is low.You can hover over a keyword for more information such as search volume. The cloud text size can be increased or decreased dynamically. You can toggle the visibility of keywords with a specific competition level (high, medium or low). A text filter also exists, allowing keywords to be removed based on certain criteria. Multiple keyword reports can be created. Master keyword lists can be generated really easily - you can simply click on a keyword within the cloud and it will add it to the 'Selected Keywords' tab. Each keyword report also includes a pie chart visualization (showing the search volume share for all keywords) and a grid view. The grid view displays the keyword data powering the cloud in a dynamic table. The grid view allows for nested sorting All of the data can be downloaded into a CSV file for a quick export. Domain Organic Ranking Report A new addition to Keyword Eye is the ability to run a report for a domain. This report will return a report similar to that of a keyword suggestion report but for the keywords that the domain is ranking for within the selected search engine. Those with a eagle eye (or even a keyword eye?) will notice that our keyword data is powered by SEMRush. Their databases are updated at the start of every month. These guys have been really helpful and I certainly recommend them. This tool was never intended to be the tool with the most comprehensive data available or even promoted as the only tool you will ever need. It's pretty useful for keyword brainstorming prior to a PPC or SEO campaign and building keyword lists easily. It's also quite a nice report to include in presentations. For those readers who work within agencies - your clients may relate to the visual nature of Keyword Eye more than a standard data table. Please try it out, leave feedback and spread the word! A basic version of Keyword Eye is free to use and always will be. We do have a Pro version now which includes average CPC, number of organic results per keyword and the domain organic ranking report discussed above. It also includes data for Bing (currently limited to Bing US). As an early gift in 2012, if you do decide to upgrade to Pro, you can use voucher code MOZBOT to save 30% per month on Pro fees (code expires at the end of January 2012). I hope some of you find find this tool useful. Please try it out and let us know what you think. We are very open to feedback (the more constructive the better). We want to keep improving it and we need a knowledgeable audience like that of SEOmoz to help us do so! Copied! Back to Top",
