By: Lindsay Wassell October 15, 2009 Rethinking Duplicate Content Technical SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. This post is about three pretty interesting things in my book: opportunities at SEOmoz, a new kind of duplicate content, and me. Despite the clever title, this post is not about SEO duplicate content. You’ve been warned, OK? That’s OK. Who are you, anyway? I know, I know - I haven’t been very active on the blog, nor have I been oot 'n aboot on the conference circuit much this year (Did I mention I'm Canadian?). But I have been busy! Back in January, I relocated from Denver to Seattle and joined SEOmoz for the coolest job ever as the SEO Consulting Manager. Oh, what a year! We have been honored to work on some of the web’s most exciting projects this year. From Fortune 500s to peppy start-ups, non-profits, and a few in between, our clients and each of their unique situations have been as challenging as they have been rewarding. All that excitement has kept me busy behind the scenes, working the SEO hands-on and rallying some of the industry’s best, brightest, and busiest to help our consulting clients succeed in the SERPs. Big deal. What else you got? Hold your horses. I’ve been busy in more ways than one, let me tell you! One night back in April, my new husband and I were settling in for another rainy night in the Pacific Northwest when … [“Lindsay, this is a family blog!” - Rand]. Oh, sorry boss. Let’s look at this from Googlebot’s perspective … That's right, Googlebot! All except the bad neighborhood thing, but I'll let you take that up with Matt. My husband Eric and I are expecting twins on December 27th! I bet our friends have some questions. Let's see if we can cover a few of them now. Frequently Asked Questions Q. Were you planning to have twins? A. Yes. Of course this was planned. [looks around nervously] ... But, seriously - do I look like I'm from the future? Boy/Girl twins are so awesome, wouldn't more people be doing it if it could be planned? My hubby and I, along with our families, can't believe our good fortune ... but no, twins weren't planned. Q. Can I have your job? A. Yes! [I mean it this time.] Rand is on the lookout for someone to fill my role. You should definitely ping him! Q. Are your twins identical? A. One is a boy. One is a girl. If they are identical ... oh dear. Q. While I'm doing your job, what will you be doing? A. I'm told that caring for an infant is a lot of work. No matter how many ways I look at this in Excel, when I multiply the work it takes to care for one infant by two ... sleep, eating, and personal hygiene disappear from the spreadsheet. Any Excel wizards out there that can help me with this? I'll also be hanging around Q&A, a service we offer our SEOmoz PRO members, to keep my offspring clothed and my skills sharp. First, I'd like to thank the Academy. Rand, Sarah, and Gillian - Each of you bring kindness, compassion, and generosity to work everyday and somehow never run out. What a team! I love you all so much, I'm inviting you into the delivery room. [*crickets chirp*]. Um, this is awkward ... How about a phone call from the hospital? Jen - Keep it up! (This woman knows her stuff. You should totally take her to lunch.) I'd also like to thank the whole crew over at SEOmoz for their warm welcome, great sense of humor, occasional lunch room snacks, and the best going away party / baby shower / fried chicken feast a girl could ask for. Wrap it up, lady. Except for the fact that I have already relocated to Florida, I'm not going anywhere yet. Pregnancy permitting, I will be working full-time until the end of November, doing what I always do on the consulting side of the business. I might even post again on the blog! [\"We've heard that before!\" - angry crowd]. In summary; Duplicate content isn't always a bad thing Don't forget to apply for my job Boy/girl twins can't be identical, for obvious reasons I heart SEOmoz I twitter (@lindzie) more than I blog Copied!
