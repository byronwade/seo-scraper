F By: fdep January 18, 2008 Track Your Keyword Ranking Results SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. A while back I asked a question in the Q&A for Premium members, searching for a tool to effectively keep track of the position of different keywords across multiple projects. At the time, there was no solution. The good news is I’ve found one and after a 30 day trial, it’s almost all positive. The program I’m using is called Advanced Web Ranking, made by a company called Caphyon. I’ve used it to accurately track the exact result for hundreds of keywords/phrases on multiple website projects. It tells me both the page number and position of the keyword, but also shows me the movement (up or down) in terms of keyword ranking performance every time I do an update. The program itself offers some other functions, but above all it is the accuracy of its results (I'm always getting the same result as the program when I do a manual search versus its automated system) that makes it worthwhile. I can also choose the search engines I want to see keyword ranking results for (I use google.com, google.com.au, and Yahoo.com). I had previously used another program, but found inaccuracies in the results it gave versus a manual search. The negatives of the program were the reporting. There was no option to display reports in Landscape view, which becomes important with a lot of information on the page. There was also no report option to display keyword ranking results in order of highest keyword position to lowest (something you can view them easily in the program itself but not output to a report). I’m interested in any feedback/results others may have had with similar programs. I’ve also looked into programs to effectively manage back links, but I’m yet to find a decent one (Caphyon actually has one, but wasn’t that great). Copied! Back to Top",
