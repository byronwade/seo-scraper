By: Rand Fishkin October 14, 2006 A Few of My Favorite Web Games Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The weekend here in Seattle is dark, foggy & wet so it's a perfect time to share some of my favorite games from the web. Some of these you can play online, others you'll have to download, and all are guaranteed to sap your productivity. Fancy Pants Adventure This flash-based game is ingeniously designed - it's in the vein of Sonic the Hedgehog, but with a stylish noir feeling and surprisingly enjoyable sound effects & music. Poom It's almost an Internet classic - Poom lets you kill an hour or 60 seconds testing your mouse placement skills. Orisinal's Bauns Somewhere between Tetris & Millipede lies Ferry Halim's Bauns. It's easy to get good, and hard to tear yourself away - my favorite is to wait for the whole screen to fill up, then change the whole board to a single color and knock 'em all out... highly satisfying. Super Mario War Mystery Guest and I have been known to play this late on Friday Nights (sad, I know). It's a downloadable game that allows for up to four players at a time. My favorite of the mini-games they offer is \"Stomp\" in which hundreds of goombas and turtles must be summarily eliminated to win. Kudos to the creative, dedicated folks at 72 DPI Army for putting this together. Raiden One of my favorites from teen years at the arcades was the flying shoot-em-up game Raiden. Some friendly Flash designers have gone to a lot of trouble to re-animate and program an online version that happily fills that nostalgic hole. If you've got a few to share, I'd love to try some new ones :) Copied! Back to Top",
