By: Rand Fishkin December 8, 2005 Resource Shelf from Gary Price Mobile SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. How can one man blog so much? Acutally, the last time I hung out with Gary, he was whipping through data sources and maps and census information and a thousand sites I had barely enough time to jot down (despite spending almost an hour in front of his laptop in the San Jose speaker ready room). Gary is seriously obsessed with culling information and finding the latest in data aggregation - he's the perfect fit for the ResourceShelf blog. Some of his latest: A movie keyword research tool from IMDB A post with links to some released documents from Vietnam, some 2005 market indicators, Wisconsin state history and a Pew study on Internet selling Another huge post with a mention of some top tech trends from a panel discussion at ALA 2005 I will say that for all the great stuff you find, it's tough that posts aren't separated by each individual item - makes it tough to link and tough to browse. Still, a great site chock full of cool bits for the data-junkies (you know who you are). Copied! Back to Top",
