B By: Budi Waluyo December 10, 2008 Offline Keyword Research for Local Languages Keyword Research This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. In mid-June 2008, I met my friend who has a canvas painted shoes boutique. She requested me to make a blog that promotes her painted shoes boutique. One of the challenges I came across when building the blog was the keyword research, as none of the online keyword research tools I used were able to return good results of searches for our local language (Indonesia). The tools always showed \"0\" or \"not available.\" The experience made me doubt that there was a market share available for her product over the internet. But then I decided to make a market survey about her product, Sepatu Lukis (in English = painted canvas shoes). I ended up asking her several questions. In English I know the term is \"painted canvas shoe,\" but I wanted to make sure which keyword I should target on her blog first. What's the most well-known phrase among people to describe such a product, and can it be sold online? Me: \"Who would likely buy your shoes? I mean your target...\" Her: \"Everyone, I think...these shoes can be for everyone. My dad (45 years old) and I wear the shoes.\" [This answer is too broad and general.] Me: \"Are these shoes popular among a particular community/type of people?\" Her: \"Umm...students love these kind of shoes. They like the personalized design and they show them off to their friends. Some music groups/musicians love them too. \" After asking several other questions, I have the following audience for my target survey: College students High school students I assembled my survey and asked the audience questions such as \"What would you call these shoes?\" and other questions about their Internet usage. I ended up getting the following survey data from about 115 college and high school students: 46.96% said they'd call the shoes Sepatu Lukis (Painted Shoes) 30.43% said Sepatu Kanvas (Canvas Shoes) 13.04% said Sepatu Kanvas Lukis (Painted Canvas Shoes) 9.57% said Sepatu Lukis Kanvas (Canvas Painted Shoes) Look at all the different ways that students used to describe one product! After 3 months of optimization and conducting some competitive analysis, we got pretty good results. We rank in the top 10 on Google for our search terms and get 50-70 visits from search traffic daily. We average selling about 10-15 shoes a week. Of course, most of our traffic comes from the sepatu lukis (painted shoes) keyword, as I had predicted. Does anyone else have an experience similar to what I did? Or would anyone like to give their input on how they do keyword research? P.S. This is my first post, so feedback and comments are really welcome. Copied! Back to Top",
