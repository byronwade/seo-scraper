By: Charlie Gray May 26, 2010 The Halo Effect on SEO Campaigns Keyword Research This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. When working with prospective clients, we often talk with them about the many long-tail or related keywords that they may show up for, in addition to the primary keyword, as we optimize their website structure, increase their content, and improve their link profile. At OrangeSoda, we refer to this as the \"halo effect,\" but it is also referred to as the umbrella effect, keyword association effect, and many other names. We have recently conducted a simple test of five random local SEO clients, each within different industries. After signup, we performed a comprehensive keyword analysis. The majority of our efforts were focused around more competitive, larger search volume keywords, but we also tracked some potential halo effect keywords that we didn’t actively optimize for. For instance, one client’s chosen keyword was “Denver pest control,” so we also tracked related, longer-tail keywords, such as: Pest control Denver Pest control Denver CO Pest control Denver Colorado Pest control in Denver Pest control services in Denver We optimized on-site aspects of each website for their respective target keywords and did link building for their keyword(s). Simultaneously, we tracked the progress of the associated keywords. What we found was surprising. Results Over the last 10 months, across our entire sample, the target keywords increased 74 positions, on average, while the related ‘halo' keywords increased 77.93 positions. This is assuming that unranked keywords started from result 200 (thanks, Rank Checker!). Targeted keywords increased in rank by 291%, while related keywords increased by 481% on average. The targeted keywords rose dramatically in rank in the first two months, with related terms pulling ahead for the last two-thirds of the study. But wait! Why did the targeted keywords (i.e., the key terms my team determined to be the strongest terms to target) not increase in rank as much as the halo terms? Explanation It appears that the target terms surge ahead at the beginning because all of the on-site optimizations were specifically targeting those terms, as well as the link building activities. One must remember, however, that the majority of the halo terms were more long-tail with less competition. The lift can be explained by the related, optimized pages becoming more relevant to the halo keywords over time than the existing competing pages in the SERP. With this in mind, be sure to take the time and plan your keyword strategy as such to maximize the value of halo keywords. Own your niche! -A.J. Wilcox SEO Team Lead OrangeSoda.com Copied!
