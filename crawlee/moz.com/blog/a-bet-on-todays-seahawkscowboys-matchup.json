By: Rand Fishkin January 6, 2007 A Bet on Today's Seahawks-Cowboys Matchup SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. My friend Joe Morin, official party coordinator of the SES & Pubcon conferences and all-around behind-the-scenes guru of the search marketing world has made a bet with me. In 16.5 hours, my Seattle Seahawks will be battling Joe's beloved Dallas Cowboys (see photos from the last matchup) for a chance to go to Chicago/New Orleans for the NFC semi-finals. Even if you have no interest in NFL football, you'll love the wager: If Joe's Cowboys win, I have to buy and wear a cowboys jersey at SES New York during my presentation: It looks horrifying already. I better not lose this one (and the bloody thing costs $75 + shipping). However, if Seattle prevails, Joe will be giving his NYC slideshow wearing one of these: Sadly, Joe's side of the bet isn't nearly as bad as mine - after all, the gorgeous Seattle jersey screams style, substance and winning seasons. It seems unfair that my downside to losing should be so much more terrible than his, but alas, I suppose that since the odds are massively in Seattle's favor, it's only fair. But, Rand, I hear you exclaim through your feedreader, I thought you said 2007 would have more signal and less noise. It's possible I said that, but that rule does not apply to the weekends. Friday, Saturday and Sunday posts are ours to do with as we please. In fact, I'm guessing that right now, 2K is planning a wonderful post about Caribou, whilst Ammon waxes philosophical on Brit-punk of the '70's vs. New York punk of the '80's. Rebecca's probably authoring a post right now about our sushi dinner with the Kirkland Googlers (great to see you all!) and how she's sad she didn't get to sit next to Adam. All suggestions for what to combine with the jerseys at SES NYC are welcome. If I lose, I'll definitely need some fashion advice - I honestly have no idea what to pair with ugly. BTW - Congrats on your progress with your project, Joe. It's remarkable what you've been able to accomplish. Copied! Back to Top",
