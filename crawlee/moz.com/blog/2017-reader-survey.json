By: Trevor Klein November 1, 2017 Help Us Improve: The 2017 Moz Blog Reader Survey Is Here Moz News | Marketing Industry Editor's note: This survey is now closed, and we're tabulating results. Stay tuned for more information about what we learned, and thank you so much for your time! It's been a couple of years since we last asked you all about what you enjoy most (and least) about the Moz Blog, and to say our company and our industry had changed in those couple of years would be an enormous understatement. We saw SERPs continue to add new features and far more featured snippets, as well as shifting massively toward HTTPS results. Here at Moz, we launched Keyword Explorer, rebuilt our Site Crawl, and made a strategic shift to refocus on our core strength of SEO. We added features to Moz Local, too, emphasizing the importance of local SEO to all businesses with a physical presence. You get the idea. With so much having changed, we wanted to be sure we're still living up to the high standards we set for this blog, and that we're still providing as valuable an experience as we can for you all. That's where you come in today. If you've got time, please consider going through the survey below, which asks about who you are, what challenges you face, and what you'd like to see more of on the Moz Blog. We'll publish the results along with our takeaways in a few weeks, and will use them to guide our work going forward. From all of us at Moz, thanks in advance for your time! Copied! Back to Top",
