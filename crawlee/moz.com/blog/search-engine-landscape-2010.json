By: Rand Fishkin May 3, 2010 The Search Engine Landscape in 2010: Rand's Presentation from Web 2.0 Expo SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I spoke this afternoon at the Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco to a room full of curious marketers & site owners. After the session, there was a lot of requests for the slide deck and thus I've shared it below. Web20 Fishkin Search Landscape I've also added Stephan Spencer's presentation on technical SEO, keyword research & targeting below: SEO_ From Soup to Nuts Presentation 1 And, last, but not least, Eric Enge's presentatino on link building from the conference as well Link Building: The Key to Rankings by Eric Enge This presentation opportunity comes courtesy of O'Reilly, who published The Art of SEO late last year (somehow, I've neglected to mention it on SEOmoz until now).
