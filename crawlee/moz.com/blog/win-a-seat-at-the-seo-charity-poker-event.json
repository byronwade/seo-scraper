P By: Patrick Sexton November 28, 2007 Win a Seat at the SEO Charity Poker Event Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Pubcon attendees beware. There is a SEO poker event going down at the Venetian hotel poker room on Dec. 6th. It begins after the Microsoft party. This event will raise money for a variety of charities. You can read more about the charities here. There will be a gradient payout from first place on down quite a few places. First place should be a fairly decent take. Full details about the tournament (including how to register, ways to donate any amount, etc.) can be found here. Drinks are free :) There will also be awesomely radtastic long-sleeved black t-shirts (and you know how much I love free shirts). Some of the notable players who have already signed up: Jim Boykin, Greg Hartnett (and just about the entire BOTW gang), Brent Csutoras, Neil Patel, and of course me, Patrick Sexton. The total buy in to participate in this game is 200 dollars (50 dollars to reserve a seat and 150 buy-in into the game). Don't have 200 bucks for a poker game? SEOish is one of the sponsors for this event, and I will be giving away three free spots. I am offering up 3 full buy-ins to this game. In other words, three people can enter this tournament for free. How to get a free spot? Leave a comment explaining why you should be given a free place at the table. Wild, wacky, truthful, boastful, whatever. We will choose the best three entries and those people will be given the details on how to get in the game for free.
