By: Rand Fishkin June 29, 2007 Come Work for SEOmoz - We're Hiring a Developer in Seattle Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz.

Are you a huge fan of the Daily Show & Colbert Report? Is your hatred for cubicles exceeded only by your desire to make the web a better place? Do you love the Venture Brothers (or at least promise to watch an episode after we lend you the DVDs)? Would you like to, on occasion, go to fun conferences in far-off cities and participate in comics like these - Chicago, London, New York? If you've answered yes to the above, congratulations!

Paste your resume into the body of the email (include any recent projects or examples of your work) Do Not send an attachment I repeat... do NOT send an attachment Please send this email to us no later than Wednesday, July 11, 2007 We know that applying for jobs can be tough, frustrating and even, on occasion, soul-crushingly depressing. We empathize, and we hope that your search leads you to something truly excellent. Thanks for your application - Craigslist rocks... While our financial compensation certainly isn't the highest in the industry, we've had terrific success bringing in hungry, talented entry level folks that others rejected due to lack of degree or specific experience, and we plan to continue with that model. Look for a new mozzer on the team sometime in August. :) p.s. Actually... Now that I look at it, according to PayScale, the median salary for a web developer with 1-4 years of experience is actually $47K (scroll down on the page). Copied! Back to Top",
