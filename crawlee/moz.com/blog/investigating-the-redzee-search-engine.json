By: Rand Fishkin October 14, 2005 Investigating the RedZee Search Engine Mobile SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. As much as I like their cool zebra logo, it appears that RedZee.com (link left out on purpose) is using a slew of bad tactics to attempt to gain popularity in the search space. I haven't personally seen referrals from them, yet, but some others have and based on their non-presence in the space until recently, it's hard to trust that data. It seems that they're also owned by a company called LinkPositions, whose operations are primarily in the creepy side of SEO - the type of \"services\" I wouldn't trust at any price. From a cre8asite thread on the subject: (Sanity)It does seem weird. I asked cause a site I'm managing is getting quite a lot of traffic from it. The referrer is: admin.redzee.com/pluginhtml/RedzeeSearch.aspx They seem to be offering their own PPC and for a few searches I've done there are lots of advertisers. Dunno I would have thought some of us would have heard of it... (Whitemark) ...check if the visitors arriving from RedZee are indeed browsing your site. Check the path - are they digging into the site and following a logical path. It could be that RedZee is indulging in referral spam or log spamming using a bot. Since they have their own ad program, they might be trying to tempt you to try them out. (Bill Slawski) I think that there's some reason to feel skeptical about a meta search engine that won't reveal the sources of its information, and that offers a toolbar that it doesn't tell you much about, while also offering a payperclick program. You can also see from the screenshot that SEOmoz is listed in their paid results for a search on the name. I'm not sure what their game is, but something surely smells fishy. Copied! Back to Top",
