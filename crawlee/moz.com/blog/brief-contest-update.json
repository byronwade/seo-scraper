By: Rand Fishkin January 18, 2006 Brief Contest Update Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The v7n...etc. contest is in full swing, with Google and Yahoo! reporting respectable numbers of results in 5 figures. Sadly, the linkdomain searches to the new domains that are ranking aren't quite accurate (I hope). Either that or domain names really do carry a lot of weight in helping to rank. Note some of the leaders: www.watching-paint-dry.com/v7ndotcom-elursrebmem - 264 links (varied domains, somewhat natural, although I'd suspect that many of the domains share some owners) v7ndotcomelursrebmem.net - 9 links (8 from a single forum) v7ndotcomelursrebmem.org - 1 link (from a pixel advertising site - kill me now) v7ndotcomelursrebmem.co.uk - 13 links (all from the same domain) blog.outer-court.com/archive/2006-01-15-n84.html - 27 links (what's this? Note this link under tools of the trade on V7N itself!!) It's still a bit early to be seeing the link networks that will undoubtedly expose themselves, but we're still seeing some interesting trends (particularly with regard to the well ranking 2nd, 3rd and 4th results).
