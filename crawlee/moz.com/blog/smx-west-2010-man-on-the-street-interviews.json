By: Jennifer Sable Lopez March 10, 2010 SMX West 2010 - Man on the Street Interviews SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Note: This post will make you smile, possibly even laugh. It won't however teach you much about SEO. You've been warned. Last week I attended SMX West in Santa Clara, California and took a couple flip video cameras along. I thought it would be fun to do \"man on the street\" interviews, somewhat along the lines of Jay Leno's \"Jaywalking\" episodes on The Tonight Show. Another great idea I had was to employ the help of Dana Lookadoo from Yo! Yo! SEO to help with the interviews. Little did I know she'd be so great at it (ok, I lie. I knew she'd do much better than I would!). She did so well in fact that our video editor, none other than my (awesome) husband Rudy Lopez, mainly only used Dana's interviews. A rockstar in the making! Rather than keeping you from this awesome video any further... I present to you: SEOmoz \"Man on Street\" - A Who's Who in Search Marketing. Thanks to all our great participants! Matt McGee, Search Engine Land and SmallBusinessSEM.com Curtis R.

Unfortunately I ended up just toting a mini whiteboard around with me all week instead. I'm sure I looked like quite the winner with my whiteboard in hand. I wonder if people think all mozzers are required to carry a whiteboard around just in case they get the urge to record a Whiteboard Friday. heh. Thanks for watching along! I hope you had as much fun watching, as we had putting it together. Again a HUGE thanks to Dana Lookadoo and Rudy Lopez for all their help. Copied! Back to Top",
