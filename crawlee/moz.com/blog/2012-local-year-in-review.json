By: David Mihm January 3, 2013 The 2012 Local Year in Review Local SEO Some of you may remember my Brief History of Google Places infographic from January 2011. It's time to update that graphic with the most memorable events of 2012 to ring in the New Year! 2012 was yet another interesting year in Local Search. Obviously, the release of Google Plus Local in May will be remembered as one of the year's biggest for quite some time. But for Google, that release was the start of a long, fairly quiet period -- not only for new product announcements, but also for algorithmic updates, personnel changes, and SERP interfaces. Compared to the frenzy of 2011, 2012 looks downright placid. In fact, for most of the second half of the year, Google seemed to devote time to shoring up the infrastructure behind this new product, increasing the speed of updates to its business index, and updating its review guidelines. Some of this backend work undoubtedly paved the way for Google's other big 2012 release: a native iOS Maps app launched in December, which has been met with rave reviews. For many in the search community, though, it was another year of playing whack-a-mole with duplicate or improperly merged client listings, missing customer reviews, and opaque \"we do not support this location\" messages in the Places Dashboard. Mike Blumenthal's epic late November rant captured this frustration better than any other. Speaking of the Places Dashboard, most of us are surprised that it still exists. The promise that a merged Places-Plus Dashboard holds is largely unfulfilled thus far, save for a couple of nice features around reviews and comments. Surely Google will have another big Local release coming in the first half of 2013 -- especially given their public pronouncement that 1/3 of all searches are Local -- but their outward opacity for most of 2012 has opened a window for some of their biggest competitors to begin catching up. Yelp announced an IPO and used some of the proceeds to buy European rival Qype. Facebook also IPO'ed and released a major mobile competitor to Google at the end of the year with Nearby. And, of course, Apple made its second major splash in the Local Search arena by releasing its own (widely panned) Maps app. As I said earlier this week on Hubspot, in terms of features, I don't see 2013 being an earth-shattering year, either for Google or its competitors. I think we'll see some consolidation and maturation of existing feature sets. The most interesting thing that I'll be watching for will be the extent to which algorithmic updates by Google reflect new opportunities for engagement by business owners on Plus. I'd love to hear from the community! Is the updated graphic and list below missing any major events that we'll remember three, four, or five years from now? What do you guys see coming in 2013? Noteworthy events in 2012 1.

Aug 12 SuperMedia and Dex Merge - Two of the four largest Internet Yellow Pages companies decide to combine forces. Are new products forthcoming, or just a consolidation of sales forces? 21. Sep 12 Google Maps Featured in The Atlantic - Second mainstream media article in 2012 about the back end of Google Maps, this one much bigger than the Mercury News's...part of a blatant PR campaign to head off coverage of Apple Maps. 22. Sep 12 Apple Maps Launches - Google's primary mobile competitor launches with a thud. 23.

Dec 12 Facebook Releases Nearby - The first indication that Facebook may finally be getting serious about Local. Copied! Back to Top",
