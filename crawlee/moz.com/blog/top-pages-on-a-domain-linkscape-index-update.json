March 22, 2009 Top Pages On A Domain - Linkscape Index Update SEO Tools Just a few short weeks ago we launched the last index update... and here we are to do it again. Ben's gotten faster at his parts of the update, from four or five weeks to just two, with me dragging my feet for another week or so. So that's right, we're down to just three or four weeks between updates, with accompanying data freshness (which we still want to improve substantially). But I'm not here to tell you about the same stuff you've already heard about. Instead, let me unveil another PRO-only SEOmoz Labs project: Top Pages. We're building Linkscape not just as a tool, but as a data source on which we and 3rd parties can build new and innovative tools. Top Pages is a showcase of some of the things we're hoping to enable. Enter a subdomain and this tool will show you the top pages on that subdomain, based on the same criteria we use for our Top Sites list. Oh, and did I mention that we've got a lot of these top pages? Wow, that's a lot of pages. We'll go up as high as 10,000 in this tool. But if you get this far and want more, check out our custom reports. Or get involved with our developer community to stay up-to-date on getting access to more of our data. So what can you do with this tool? Investigate which pages make a big link impact, even if they're not generating substantial traffic See which pages have ranking potential with keyword tweaks, if they're not already ranking See which competitor pages are getting traction See where competitors spend link-building energy By coupling Top Pages with the Labs Backlinks Tool we launched a couple of weeks ago, you can get a pretty good idea of which pages on a domain have ranking potential and what links are powering that potential. Enjoy, and be sure to send us feedback if you like this! Copied! Back to Top",
