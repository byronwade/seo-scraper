By: Rand Fishkin February 23, 2005 Yellow Shoes @ NYC SES Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. It may seem unconventional to wear yellow sneakers with a suit, but that's what I'll be in on Monday the 28th - the first day of the Search Engine Strategies Conference. Look for a touch of yellow on the floor if you'd like to chat and feel free to criticize my Seattle fashion sense. My goals for the conference are to meet and make friends with my fellow SEOs and others in the search industry. I'm also hoping to learn as much as possible and share that knowledge with my readers. During the conference, I will not be blogging live, but I will try to summarize the days events and do some photoblogging too around the end of the day - 8pm-11pm EST. Thanks for all the encouragement I've received from my readers - you've helped make this trip a priority for me. Copied! Back to Top",
