Participants Aaron Miranda Tom Rand Sarah Danny (1st Place) Crissy Ben (from Distilled) \"Official\" Rules The winner is the person who can eat the most amount of pie before the end of a predetermined song. (The song will be roughly 3 min 14 seconds) No Hands! You must get the nod from Christine before moving on to the next pie. (Lord Christine will be the sole judge of whether or not a person is done with their pie.) All pies are approximately the same consistently and size* * - Except for Aaron’s pie. He went out of his way to get a Vegan friendly pie (respect!) but chose a Pecan pie (wait what? Please someone explain density and sharp nuts to him ;-p) Copied! Back to Top",
