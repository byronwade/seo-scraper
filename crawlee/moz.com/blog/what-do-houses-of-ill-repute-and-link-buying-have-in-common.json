By: Rand Fishkin July 2, 2005 What do Houses of Ill Repute and Link Buying have in Common? Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Over at WebHostingTalk, a very popular forum in the web hosting industry, there's a thread about buying links vs. earning them. The advice tends towards a very white hat point of view, but one member in particular, the_pm, sums it up so eloquently that I couldn't put it better myself: IMNSHO, paying for pagerank v. seeking out legitimate links is the difference between meeting someone, falling in love and getting married v. paying for a hooker. Since it's a rare Saturday night post, I figure even SEOmoz is entitled to have a little risque content... BTW - Special thanks to Geraldine for the suggestion of what to use as an image for this post. Yahoo! image searches for related terms were bringing up some very inappropriate content. Copied!
