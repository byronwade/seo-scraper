By: Rand Fishkin September 1, 2006 The Culture Shift at Google Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Almost everyone in the industry who's had a chance to interact one on one with a Googler in the past 6 months has probably noticed that it \"feels\" different from the interactions of the past 3 years. Robert Scoble did a good job describing it with regard to his recent visit to the 'plex: ...every interaction I had with Googlers this time was different than the last time I was on campus. They seemed more humble. More comfortable. More inquisitive. And, when I gave them chances to say “you’re an idiot” they didn’t take it (and I gave them many opportunities). This is a different Google than I was used to. And it’s the small things that I noticed. One other small thing I noticed? A lot more blog listening behavior. Carl Sjogreen, who runs the Google Calendar team, told me that the first thing he does every morning is do this search: “Google Calendar.” He says he answers everyone’s questions, even if you’re a kid in another country with only four readers. There's a lot of other very good examples of this shift in behavior, including: Matt Cutts' blog Vanessa Fox & the Webmaster Central team's blog The private invitations to tour Google during the SES San Jose show (Matt & Rebecca from SEOmoz went and Bill from SEO by the Sea was there, too) Googlers (who aren't Matt) interacting after hours with SEOs The hiring of Adam Lasnik Googlers reading and participating in blogs and forums Personally, I'm thrilled to see this change. I honestly did not expect that they'd go down this path until they were faced with a loss or failure. Google's communication structure has gone from hubris to relative humility in a remarkably short period of time. Do you get the same sense? What have been your experiences with Google of late?
