  "content": "Moz Keyword Explorer vs. Google Keyword Planner: The Definitive Comparison Keyword Research | SEO Tools By: Britney Muller October 31, 2016 Table of Contents Copied! By: Britney Muller October 31, 2016 Moz Keyword Explorer vs. Google Keyword Planner: The Definitive Comparison Keyword Research | SEO Tools Keyword research, the blueprint to any successful SEO strategy If you’ve been doing keyword research for a while, you’ve probably fallen into a routine. And that routine has likely been recently disrupted... thanks, Google. If you’re new to keyword research, getting comfortable with new keyword research tools will come more easily to you. Lucky pups. But us change-averse old dogs can still learn new tricks when we need to. Are you ready to see which tool is right for you? --Woof. My hesitations about writing this article: I’m new to Moz and don’t want to be crucified for criticizing our own keyword research tool. This concern has only been met with acceptance and encouragement, so…*fingers crossed* they don’t change their minds. Love you guys! My methods of keyword research revolve around finding qualified traffic for increasing conversions, not just any large search volume numbers (to make traffic look good). I fear that this will come across as a Moz Keyword Explorer soft sell. It’s not. It’s a very honest comparison of Moz Keyword Explorer versus Google’s Keyword Planner. It's a post that I've been wanting to read for a while. Here are some great guides if you need a Moz Keyword Explorer refresher, or a Google Keyword Planner refresher. < << TL;DR Skip to the conclusion here >> > Google Keyword Planner's recent change Any habits we’ve held onto with Google Keyword Planner were disrupted early September when they decided to stop providing average monthly search volume data (unless you’re in that special group of higher-paying ad buyers who can still access the more precise search volume data). Instead, we now see huge swings of min-max search volume, which really starts to muddy the keyword research waters. Google recently came forward to explain that this change was done to deter scrapers from pulling their search volume data. For a more comprehensive write-up on this change, read Google Keyword Unplanner by Russ Jones. He explains a little more about how this change affects various data sources and what Moz has been doing to mitigate the impact. But, showing is better than telling. So let’s take a look for ourselves: A 900,000 average monthly search volume swing is crazy! In fact, Google now only provides one of seven volume sizes: 0–10, 10–100, 100–1000, 1000–10000, 10000–100k, 100k–1MM and 1MM+. Moz’s Keyword Explorer also gives ranges, but they’re not nearly as vast (or as arbitrary). The machine-learning model behind Keyword Explorer is designed to predict monthly fluctuations in search volume. It’s mathematically tied to the most accurate keyword data available, and you can see exactly how, and how accurate Moz gets in this Clickstream Data to the Rescue article. Which is why I wanted to know: What's most important to you when doing Keyword Research?— Britney Muller (@BritneyMuller) September 1, 2016 What are quality keywords? Quality keywords successfully target your demographic during their acquisition phase (education - purchase), have a specific searcher intent, low-medium organic competition, and medium-high search volume (this will vary based on what part of the acquisition funnel you're targeting). However, it's important to keep in mind that some longer-tail queries (with little to no search volume) can be highly profitable as well. Tier 1 keyword research setup Google Keyword Planner: This is my familiar, kooky old friend that has been acting very strange lately (anyone else noticing all of the delays and glitches?). I’m a little worried. Anywho, here’s how I begin keyword research within Keyword Planner: Enter in your keyword under “Search for more keywords using a phrase, website or category.” Make sure the region is set to United States (if wanting to research nationally). Set keyword options to “broad.” --Settle down, we’ll go back and change this to “closely related” after our first swoop. Sort keyword volume by highest to lowest and change the “show rows” to 100. IMPORTANT: Always scroll top to bottom! Otherwise, new keywords will populate from the bottom that you'll miss. Select keywords with unique intents as you scroll down the first 100 rows, click \"next,\" and start again from the top until through all keyword results. Moz Keyword Explorer: My hip new friend that I’m not sure I can trust just yet. However, multiple trusted friends vouch for her integrity and... I really dig her style. Here’s how I begin keyword research within Keyword Explorer: Enter your keyword into the Keyword Explorer search bar. Navigate to “Keyword Suggestions” on the left-hand menu. Set “Display keyword suggestions that” to “include a mix of sources.” Set “Group Keywords” to “no.” Sort keyword list by highest search volume to lowest. Scroll down and select keywords with unique searcher intent. The thing that’s taken the most getting used to is not seeing a competition/difficulty metric adjacent to the search volume. The whole goal of keyword research is to discover opportunity gaps that offer mid-to-high search volume with low competition. If you’re anything like me, you’ve ran hundreds if not thousands of strange SEO tests and are very aware of what you can achieve “competition”-wise (domain-dependent) and what you can’t. (Or when a higher-competition keyword should take the form of a longer SEO plan.) *It’s important to note that the KWP “Competition” metric is an advertising metric. Despite this metric occasionally leading to an SEO correlation, it’s often misleading and not an accurate representation of how competitive the organic results are. The KWE “Difficulty” metric, on the other hand, is an organic search metric. It also leverages a smarter CTR curve model to show when weaker pages are ranking higher (in addition to other ranking signals). That being said, having to wait to find out the competition metric of a keyword until after I add it to a list is frustrating. I can’t help but feel that I’m not selecting keywords as strategically as I could be. Hopefully, Moz will add a historical competition metric up front (adjacent to search volume) sometime in the near future to help us better select ripe keyword opportunities. The relevancy metric doesn’t do much to help my research because I’m already relying on the keywords themselves to tell me whether or not they're relevant/have a unique user intent. (I told you guys I would be honest!) Label by keyword type: Navigational: Searchers seeking a destination on the web. Example: \"University of Minnesota tuition\" Informational: Searchers researching, getting quick answers, often times using what, who, where, how, etc. modifiers. Example: \"what is a conker\" Commercial Investigation: Searchers investigating beyond an informational query. Comparing brands, searching for \"best,\" researching potential clients, etc. Example: \"ppc experts in london\" Transactional: Searchers looking to purchase something, comparing rates, seeking prices for things, etc. Example: \"affordable yoda action figure\" Transactional and Commercial Investigation types tend to be most profitable (depending on business model). For example, a blog could do very well from Informational-type keywords. If you want a more in-depth understanding of keyword types; read Rand's Segmenting Search Intent. <-- An oldie, but a goodie!! Compare results & answer: Which tool provided better long-tail results? Which tool provided better top-of-funnel queries? What percentage of \"keyword types\" did each tool provide? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each tool? For whatever reason, “student loans” painted an accurate picture (of what I’ve found to be true across other competitive keywords) for each prospective tools’ wheelhouse. So, “student loans” will serve as our point of reference throughout this comparative analysis.

However, I’ve left all my results at a neutral Importance (3) so you can see downloaded results without any customization (and to keep things fair, because I’m not prioritizing GKP keywords). If you choose to use this metric, you set a priority level for each keyword (1=not important, 10=most important) that will then influence the keyword's Priority score. This allows you to more easily prioritize a keyword plan, which is very helpful. Group keywords with low lexical similarity: While this can save you time, it can also lead to missing keyword opportunities. In my example below, if I select \"student loans\" (and not \"Select 821 keywords in group\"), I would miss all of the nested keywords.

GKP also continued to provide a broader set of top-of-funnel keyword opportunities: student loan bankruptcy, student loan gov, student loan help, how to get a student loan, etc. Moz Keyword Explorer largely uncovered Commercial Investigation and Informational queries. MKE also continued to provide a broader set of long-tail keyword opportunities: student loan forgiveness for teachers, student loan providers, student loan status, how do i find my student loan, etc. Where this is the end of the road for Google results, Moz has some other filters up its sleeve: Let's explore the other available Moz keyword filters and examine the discovered keyword results (keywords with unique intent). Exclude your query terms to get broader ideas: 25 keywords Most results are longer-tail queries around college tuition, educational expenses, private school tuition, etc. This evenly resulted in Informational, Navigational, and Transactional keyword results: Based on closely related topics: 35 keywords One of the more evenly distributed (search volume) results in this example. Most keyword results are around other types of loans or grants: payday loan, pell grants, auto loan, private loans, etc. Based on broadly related topics and synonyms: 74 keywords Results are mostly three words or longer and revolve around more specific types of loans; great lakes student loans, wells fargo student loans, student loan chase, etc. Related to keywords with similar results pages: 187 keywords Results are mostly long-tail Commercial Investigation queries around loan payments, student loan consolidation, student loan forgiveness for teachers, student loan payment help, etc. Are questions: 111 keywords Last, but certainly not least. The crème de la crème of an FAQ page. Results reveal long-tail student loan questions (mostly Informational), like: can you file bankruptcy on student loans, do student loans affect credit score, are student loans tax deductible, where can i get a student loan, etc. TL;DR Conclusion: Google Keyword Planner has limited search volume data, but continues to provide a broader set of top-of-funnel keywords (high volume, low competition <-- ad metric). Despite the \"closely related\" filter resulting in a more even percentage of all 4 keyword types, it provided fairly similar results (35.4% duplicate) to \"broad.\" Commercial and Informational keyword types were most commonly found. Moz Keyword Explorer provides more accurate search volume data, while providing a broader set of long-tail keywords (mid-to-low volume, low competition). The many keyword filters provide a wide range of keyword results (17% duplicate in first two filters) and keyword types depending on which keyword filter you use. However, Informational, Commercial Investigation, and Navigational keyword types were most commonly found. Pros: Moz Keyword Explorer: Google Keyword Planner: The keyword search volume accuracy (IMO) is the most impressive part of this tool. The ability to view mobile versus desktop monthly trends is wonderful. Better UX. Can add negative keywords/keywords to not include in results. Keyword suggestion filters reveal far more keyword results. Google Sheet download integration. The “are questions” filter is incredibly useful for things like FAQ pages and content marketing ideas. Average keyword bid (for further competition insight). Saved keyword lists (that can be refreshed later!? Say whaa!?) International (multilingual) keyword research capabilities. Detailed SERP data for SERP feature opportunities. Monthly keyword trend data (on hover). Organic competition metric. Ability to target specific hyper-local areas. Ability to prioritize keywords which influences the Priority metric (for smarter keyword prioritization). Free. Cons: Moz Keyword Explorer: Google Keyword Planner: The Min Volume | Max Volume | Difficulty | Organic CTR | Importance | Priority can be overwhelming. Search volume ranges are widely skewed and bucketed. No Google Sheet download integration. Individuals who start adding keywords from the bottom up of a list (scrolling up) will miss newly populated results. No “select all” option. Broad & Closely Related filters tend to provide very similar (if not the same) results. Inability to target specific local regions. No SERP feature data. English-only International keyword results. Can’t save lists. No monthly keyword trend data available. Clunky, slow UX. Which is right for you? I’d consider where you want to target people in your sales funnel, and where you need to improve your current website traffic. If you have wide top-of-funnel traffic for your product/service and need to better provide long-tail transactions, check out Moz Keyword Explorer. If you need a brief overview of top-level searches, take a look at Google Keyword Planner results. Which do I use? I'm a little ashamed to say that I still use both. Checking Google Keyword Planner gives me the peace of mind that I’m not missing anything. But, Moz Keyword Explorer continues to impress me with its search volume accuracy and ease of list creation. As it gets better with top-of-funnel keywords (and hopefully integrates competition up front on the list of keyword suggestions) I would love to transition completely over to Moz. Other keyword research tips: I’ve also been a big fan of www.keyword.io to give your initial keyword list a boost. You can add your selected keywords directly to Google Keyword Planner or Moz Keyword Explorer for instant keyword data. This can help identify where you should take your keyword research in terms of intent, sub-topic intents, geographic, etc. Answer the Public is also a great resource for FAQ pages. Just make sure to change the location if you are not based in the UK. Would love your feedback! Please let me know if you can think of other ways to determine the quality of keywords from each tool.
