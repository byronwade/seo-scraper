By: Brian Brown February 15, 2007 SEO - Well If It Isn’t Rocket Science? Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. The debate continues to wage within the SEM family as to whether SEO is rocket science. Somewhere along the way, it seems that this has become a question of literals? This is certainly a great position to be in if you are on the opposing side of the debate since it takes away the relative meaning of the statement and simply leaves a true or false statement. So if we are stuck in this literal sense, then perhaps SEO practitioners are left with no choice but to agree. After all, only rocket science is truly rocket science. Though one must wonder, is rocket science actually \"rocket science\" to rocket scientists? Or is it more like baking a cake? Perhaps we can arrive at a more acceptable analogy that might even work for both SEO and PPC... assuming of course we can leave the literal interpretations aside. We might even find that the two, often separated only by a few pixels one way or another, are more similar than dissimilar. I propose the comparison of SEO and PPC to mountain climbing. Let's say we have Mt. SEO to our left and Mt. PPC to our right. From a distance, they may appear very similar, almost identical. Mt. PPC may appear a little thinner, but they certainly share many similar traits. In both cases, the goal is usually to get to the top, often in a race against our competitors, plant our flag and hopefully remain \"King of the Mountain\" for as long as we can. Just like in real mountain climbing, there have been those who have demonstrated that you needn't be an expert climber with years of experience. There have even been those that have shown that you can overcome amazing challenges to do so. Now in climbing Mt. SEO or Mt. PPC, it is easiest at the beginning. Where the terrain is more flat, we are able to cover more ground faster and with less skill, knowledge or energy. Climbers will find that the climb becomes more challenging, steeper and perhaps less progress will be made given the same efforts as before. At some point, the mountaineer may find that they are unable to make any further progress. A decision must be made. Should they look for another route? Maybe one that isn't as steep or challenging? Do they just try to hold their position? Do they just give up? Do they need more time, knowledge or experience? These are all certainly acceptable options. Choosing the best option often involves weighing the situation with the goals and desires. Some may want to take the time to seek out more knowledge and education to become better climbers. Others may decide to turn to professional mountaineers who can take their flag and continue the journey for them. Mountain climbing isn't limited to anyone who wants to invest the time and energy to learn how to climb, just that it may not always be the best option given the overall end goal or desire. As professional mountaineers, either on Mt. SEO or Mt. PPC, it is our responsibility to help other climbers based on their needs and desires. Some may want and have the ability to climb all the way to the top with no help from us. Others may want to make the climb to a point and have us take over from there. And others may just want to sit down at the base camp and let us make the ascent on their behalf. Regardless which mountain we wish to call our own, we have a responsibility to those who hire us for assistance to work with the best of our abilities and to look out for their best interests. We also should have a responsibility to look out for the best interests of our industry, and while sometimes competitive, regard our peers with respect. Besides, at least on Mt. PPC, one can simply rent a helicopter to fly them to the top. Happy climbing! Copied! Back to Top",
