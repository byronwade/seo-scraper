By: Scott Willoughby August 13, 2009 Whiteboard Friday - Matt Cutts on NoFollow The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. This week we've got a special treat! Live from the halls of SES San Jose, our own Jen Lopez sits down with the one-and-only Matt Cutts to discuss NoFollow. As we all know, there was some controversy about Google's shifting views on nofollow earlier this year. So now that some time has passed and Big G has refined their position, what would Matt recommend to sites that have lots of nofollow tags already in place? Watch this exclusive interview to find out.From Jen: This has been a great week at SES San Jose 2009. There were lots of great sessions, informative tweets, fun swag and I've personally met many of our Pro members! My favorite session of the week was \"Extreme Makeover: Live Site Clinic\" where Matt Cutts, Greg Boser, Elisabeth Osmeloski, Tiffany Lane and Vanessa Fox (unofficially :)) reviewed several websites in front of hundreds of people. The use of the rel=nofollow for PR sculpting came up in the review (imagine that). Matt Cutts recommended to a site owner that he remove all the nofollows from his site, even to non-necessary pages. This is a subject that comes up time and time again on the SEOmoz site whether it's in the Q & A section, or in the blog and comments. So I wanted to find out directly from Matt, what he would recommend to our users moving forward. This afternoon I sat with Matt and got his take on the conference in general as well as the use of rel=nofollow and PR sculpting. (Oh yea! And if you haven't seen the tweets and read the posts yet, Matt got a new haircut. :) SEOmoz Whiteboard Friday - Matt Cutts on NoFollow from Scott Willoughby on Vimeo. Copied! Back to Top",
