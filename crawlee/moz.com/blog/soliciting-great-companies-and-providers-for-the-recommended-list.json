By: Rand Fishkin June 14, 2006 Soliciting Great Companies and Providers for the Recommended List Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. From the responses I've been getting from many of the folks I refer to SEOmoz's Recommend List (averaging about 3 leads per day), the list is getting a bit stale. Many of the people seeking services are being turned away, often because their brands aren't big enough, they don't have enough to spend on SEO or they're simply not a good fit. In many of these cases, the businesses seeking SEO contracting have legitimate companies and business models, so it's not just bad clients. What I'm hoping to start in the comments of this thread are your suggestions for SEO companies or individuals that you think deserve to be on the list. Now's your chance to nominate your favorites or even yourself (if you think you've got what it takes). I'll spend some time looking into everyone who gets mentioned and only list those folks I'm confident in, but please be as generous as you can - there are a lot of people who need SEO help. Also - please note that I'm also seeking recommendations for web designers, developers, PPC management firms, web hosting companies, registrars and analytics companies. If you've had a great experience (or you run a great company in this field) please drop a line below. Thanks for all your help! Hopefully, it will lead to a lot more business for you and/or the companies you find valuable. Final Thought - Don't be shy about submitting your own firm. This is one of those times when self promotion in the blog comments is greatly appreceated. Copied! Back to Top",
