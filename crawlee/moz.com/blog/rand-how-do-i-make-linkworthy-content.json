Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin October 12, 2005 Rand, How do I make Link-Worthy Content? Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I get asked this all the time when I'm consulting. It's the mantra of the link hungry and content poor and it's a great question - one that's worthy of being repeated over and over (though it need not always involve my first name). There's no easy answer, but there is a simple way I can show you the kinds of content and let you think up your own way to do it. Thanks to our friends at del.icio.us, we've got a great page that shows you exactly what's being linked to right now on the web. Trust me, if 500+ people have tagged it, thousands more are reading and linking. So, before you ask, go ahead and find your tag (whether that's cars or mortgages or texas hold 'em) and look at who's generating the big numbers. That should help guide you down the path to linkability. BTW - For you googlebombing fans out there - check out this virtual movement to make wikipedia the \"miserable failure\" of the poker world. 6,000 bloggers linking with the anchor text \"texas hold 'em\" and not one of those in the comments. p.p.s. Speaking of link-worthy content - this reminds me of how my little brother's friends talk to each other over IM... No judgement call, here, just something funny for the water cooler. Copied!
