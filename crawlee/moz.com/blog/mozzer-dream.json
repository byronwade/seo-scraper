S By: SeanMaguire November 6, 2007 Mozzer Dream Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Awoke did I unto a dream, Of search delight from Mozzers' team. A move afoot, a man named Rand, Community building was well at hand. To rule the SERPs a common goal, And steal a bite off G’s control. Compelling place this home I’ve found, Wicked smart people clearly abound. Rebecca and Jane, Rand’s trust they hold, I hope he pays them their weight in vingold. From Dr. Pete to Vangogh99, Well written words seem to flow like fine wine. A guy named Critchlow, a gal named deCabbitt Chasing the engines like a furry Jack…Daniels. :) Kimber, Bookworm, and some cat named Matt Cutts, There’s so much to learn, I feel like a klutz. But I live for the search, so I continue to click, And hope when I comment I don’t sound like a FactPile. Seems there’s people to love and people to “whatever,” Even a Mystery Guest, who I hope blogs forever. This community is growing , of which I’m just a small part Though this post is off topic – please consider it a start. Copied! Back to Top",
