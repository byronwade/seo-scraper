By: Dudley Carr February 9, 2016 We're Thrilled to Announce... Moz Local Insights Released from Beta! Local SEO | Moz News Editor's note: We've made a change to some of the data available within Search Insights. Please take a moment to read about what's different below. Thanks! :-) Today we’re excited to remove the Beta label on Moz Local Insights! This feature has been in beta since November when David first announced it. This release of Insights continues the push to provide our customers with a holistic understanding of local search presence. First, a tremendous thank you to all of our customers who gave us feedback about what works and what doesn’t work. In the two months that Insights has been active for all 60K+ listings in Moz Local, we’ve collected 2.5 billion individual metrics! Insights is tracking 220K search keywords, traffic for 13K locations in Google Analytics, and 1.1M reviews. Now, with the addition of Google My Business data and Google/Facebook reviews, Moz Local Insights is ready to have organizations large and small depend on it to deliver value for customers investing in local search. This release includes a large number of small improvements and tweaks. However, the following are the big changes since we first announced Insights: First up: Google My Business dataThe release of the Google My Business API has been a welcome change for everyone doing local listing management. We have big plans in the near future to make extensive use of the API to help with distribution by eliminating the need for downloading and uploading CSVs every time listing information changes. Moz Local Insights helps clients with many US/UK locations see what their performance looks like in aggregate across all your Google My Business locations. We’re using the API to help collect Google My Business data currently locked away in the dashboard and accessible only a single location at a time. Here’s how Google My Business data looks like within Moz Local for a medium-sized client: The screenshot shows 35 listings aggregated in a graph with the same data that’s available in GMB. Insights will also break out locations by best performing, worst performing, and top gains and losses. The same data is available for the click data. Google My Business makes up to 90 days of data available. With Insights, we'll track this data over time, starting with the initial 90 days of data available in GMB at the time we’re given authorization. Update for March 2016It’s been several weeks since we launched Search Insights out of beta, and we’re excited to see how people are using it. Google My Business (GMB) Insights data is an interesting addition to the traffic, rankings and reviews that define Moz Local Insights. Regrettably, we added that data too soon, and we’ve decided to suspend the the GMB Insights collection until it’s available via the Google My Business API. Given how much interest there is in providing this for larger organizations, we believe Google will make this functionality available in the near future, at which time it will be available once again as part of Moz Local Insights. In the meantime, Google Analytics at the store location page level offers similar insights, and, just as you have since day one, you’ll still be able to take advantage of Moz Local Insights to drill down and view online metrics related to your search visibility, reputation and performance by region, state, or even the individual store level. Please reach out to our Help Team with any questions or concerns you might have. Second: PDF reportsFrom the beginning, Moz Local Insights has aimed to focus on the data and the visualizations that are the most meaningful to you and your client. The missing link has been making that data available via PDFs so that they can easily be shared with others. We provide a single PDF, organized in sections containing the following Insights sections: Distribution Insights (Accuracy, Listing Score, and Reach) Performance (Google My Business and Google Analytics) Visibility (Local pack and organic) Reputation Our focus for this feature was to make the PDFs easy to set up, compelling, and beautiful. Here's a peek at what the PDF report looks like for Moz.com: You can check out the full sample PDF report here. Starting todayWith Moz Local Insights coming out of Beta, we’re starting our normal 2-week trial for listings. During the 2-week trial, you’re free to try out all of the functionality — including the newly announced features. You can purchase the listings at any point during the trial. Pricing is only $120 for self-serve locations and $99 for enterprise locations per year. What’s next?We’re happy to get all of the improvements out, but there's more goodness along the way — and shortly! Here's the list of things we'll tackle next for Search Insights: Exporting via CSV Omniture support Keyword suggestions On-demand PDF exports More review sites including Instagram Even though the beta period is over, we’re just as eager to hear from you about what works or could be better with Moz Local Insights.
