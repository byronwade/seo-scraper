By: Megan Singley February 10, 2014 Introducing the New MozPlex Moz News While 2014 has just begun, it's already been filled with new and exciting changes for Moz. Not only do we have a new CEO, but all of us Mozzers have packed up and moved to a much bigger office that we all actually fit into. Remember when we moved into our last office and we had all that space? Well, that didn't last long (about three years). We didn't move very far, just a few blocks south on 2nd Avenue in downtown Seattle. We're excited that we only had to walk a couple blocks to watch the Seahawks victory parade! Today is a super-special day because you've all won a golden ticket for a peek into Roger's new home. Unfortunately, there won't be any songs, dances, or little orange men with green hair, but we do always have tons of chocolate. :-) So let's get this show on the road! When you step off the elevator onto the 5th floor, you're greeted by our lovely Team Happy in this reception area. Oooooh, pretty. It looks like the future! Once you answer me these questions three, the rest of the office you shall see! (We'll actually just let you go in.) One of the main focal points of the MozPlex is the stairwell. Who knew stairs could be so cool? It's made out of torched fir and hemlock, because why have regular fir when it can be torched? We even have an exposed brick wall because—let's be honest—what kind of a tech company in Seattle would we be without an exposed brick wall? Look left before descending the stairs and you'll find a huge room of Mozzers hard at work. You'll notice we have desks that can transform to a standing position with the push of a button. Just can't sit anymore? Go ahead and stand up! Tired of standing? Take a seat. Want something in between? Crouch away! The opportunities are (kind of, but not really) endless. Head right, and you'll enter our brand new kitchen! This is definitely one of the things the Mozzers were most excited for. If you ever stopped by the old MozPlex, you'd have noticed that our kitchen was teeny-tiny for the amount of people we had. Lunch started to look like a coordinated dance to get to the refrigerator, use the microwave, or grab a fork. Not anymore! We just might have to move all the tables one day and have a roller-skating party. Keep heading through the kitchen and you'll see our stage, which will be home to family meetings (a.k.a. all-staff meetings), lunch-and-learns (last week we learned about commuting to work by bike!), industry meetups, and most definitely lots and lots of karaoke. Walk past the stage, and you'll find a ping pong table (also a Seattle tech company requirement). Check out Ryan's mean backhand! Lastly, we now have conference rooms galore! Gone are the days of searching high and low for an available room for 1-on-1s. We now have a whopping 45 rooms to choose from, with names like Millennium Falcon, Serenity, and Galactica for our spaceship-themed 5th-floor rooms, and R2-D2, Johnny 5, and Bender for our robot-themed 4th-floor rooms. Of course, we have one room named after Roger. Each of these rooms has a schedule controlled by a tablet outside the door, so we can always tell if a space is available. Well, that concludes this virtual tour of the MozPlex. Before we go, we want to give a huge thanks to our office manager, Hillari, for working tirelessly to make this a fantastic office. We also want to thank Jess, Mikayla, Danie, Nicelle, Crystal, Erin, Roxana, Anne, Susan, Dave K., David J, Jacob, Elijah, and Derric for helping to get everything set up and looking awesome from day one. You all are the bee's knees! If you're interested in a real-life visit to our office, we'll have tours during SMX Advanced and MozCon. We'll post sign-ups for tours as we get closer to these events. We'd love to see you. :-) Copied! Back to Top",
