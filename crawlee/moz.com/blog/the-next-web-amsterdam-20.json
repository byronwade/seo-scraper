K By: katfive June 29, 2006 The Next Web: Amsterdam 2.0 Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. It's been several months since we launched the 2006 Web 2.0 Awards, but the buzz is still going strong. Later tonight I'm meeting with one of the companies we reviewed. Then, next Wednesday I'm off to Amsterdam for The Next Web Conference, where speakers including Kevin Kelley (of Wired Magazine), Michael Arrington (of TechCrunch), and Kevin Rose (of Digg) will address the way Web 2.0 is changing the way people use the internet. The conference is only one day long but promises to pack a whole lot into ten hours. Between speakers, several up-and-coming Euopean Web 2.0 companies will showcase their products to show us what they've got. During the lunch break, attendees will have the chance to make a real elevator pitch to managing partners from Atlas Venture... in an elevator. Rand scoffed when I told him this, but I think it's an ingenious way to put 'em on the spot reality-TV style. And it's horribly cute. Thanks to Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten of Fleck for inviting me to attend and cover the conference. I'm sure I'll be spending my insomniac hours blogging and posting photos, so stay tuned on July 7th and 8th for more updates! Though I lived in Germany for a year when I was very young, this is my first trip to Amsterdam. I couldn't stand to just turn around and come back... lucky for me my aunt lives in town, so I'm taking the week after the conference to visit and explore. Hooray, so far I've lived up to visiting one new country a year for the last three years! If you're in the area and would like to chat, look me up by email. Otherwise, tot ziens (goodbye), and I'll see you next blogging from the Netherlands. Copied! Back to Top",
