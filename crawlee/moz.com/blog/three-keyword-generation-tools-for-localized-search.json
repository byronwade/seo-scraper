M By: manybody January 16, 2009 Three Keyword Generation Tools for Localized Search SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. After doing SEO and SEM for localized clients, I grew tired of always needing to use Excel and making repeated searches on Google. I hated having a dentist in Nowheresville and trying to figure out all of the nearby towns and major neighborhoods that people might be searching for. For any of those who know what that feels like, these tools are for you: Tool One: City, State and Zip Code Concatenator Anyone who has had a bulk keyword list and wanted to combine local city names in Excel can admit that it is very time consuming. This tool takes all the work out for you. It can generate for you all the cities (with state and zip code) within a 100 mile radius of your zip code and combine these geographic modifiers with your keyword list. Taking it one step further, it can output “Keyword City” or “City Keyword” as well as “Keyword in City.” Tool Two: Neighborhood Keyword Concatenator Attack the long-tail with the same type of keyword tool mentioned above except in this case, find all of the major neighborhoods within a 10 mile radius. Tool Three: Local Competitor Generator How useful would it be to know what major brands appear when searching websites such as the YellowPages.com and other online directories? Who has the time to do repeated searches over and over again? Save time and headache with this keyword tool that will generate your keywords. Now that you are spending less time doing competitive brand research, you’ll have more time doing other things. Copied! Back to Top",
