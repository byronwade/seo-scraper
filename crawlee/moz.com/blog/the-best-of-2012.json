Table of Contents Copied! By: Ashley Sefferman January 3, 2013 The Best of 2012: Top Posts and People of the Year Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Now that 2012 has come to a close, it's time to take a look back at the posts and community members that made the biggest impacts on the Moz blog throughout the year! This year offered unlimited awesomeness to highlight, but we had to pick and choose. The list includes top posts based on unique pageviews, thumbs up, total number of comments, and linking root domains. We also highlight the community members who left top comments (by thumbs up) and those who left the highest amount of comments throughout the year. If there are any posts you didn't get a chance to read (or any epic posts you can't wait to re-read), my advice is to grab your favorite mug, fill it with a tasty treat, and curl up in your favorite cozy place to catch up on the best of the Moz blog in 2012. I'm excited to hear your thoughts on your favorite posts, why you think they did so well, and what you'd like to see more of in 2013! A quick-reference list of the Top Posts of 2012: Unique pageviews Thumbs up Total number of comments Linking root domains And one for the community members who Mozzed our socks off: Top comments (by thumbs up) Top users (by total comments) Data disclaimer: This data was gathered within the last 24 hours, so the numbers may change slightly (if so, my apologies). A huge thank you goes to Casey Henry, who helped me gather and compile a fair amount of the data used. All of the data used is current and reliable to the best of my knowledge, but keep in mind that I'm no data scientist like our wonderful Matt Peters. :) Before we dive into the posts, let's look at this year's top ten post topics: Link Building Content & Blogging Social Media Search Engine Trends On-Page / Site Optimization Analytics Technical SEO Issues Whiteboard Friday Intermediate & Advanced SEO Search Industry Top posts of 2012 by unique pageviews Traffic surge, anyone? Our 2012 unique pageviews were off the charts! Although Rand's updated post from 2007 claims the number one spot by a large margin, nine other amazing posts aren't far behind.
