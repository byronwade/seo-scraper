M By: Miranda Rensch December 14, 2011 Introducing SEOmoz Custom, Automated PDF Reports! SEO Reporting What’s more tasty than hot buttered nog, more cheery than an elf’s wide smile, and more efficient than hiring a tipsy, giggling elf to do your reporting? Custom, automated PDF reports, of course! The Moz team is excited to announce our newest addition to PRO. This is one of our most requested features, and we’ve been working tremendously hard for several months to deliver what you need for reporting. This has proved to be a complicated task since it integrates many of our different data sources and has quite a few customization options. We can’t wait for you to try out this new reporting section! How to use custom PDF reports The new custom PDF reporting feature allows you to create a customized PDF report using SEOmoz PRO data. These reports can be set up to send to you and other people you specify each week, month, or quarter. You can also add notes and create different versions of the report with different sets of data, allowing you to customize the information for the right audience. Let me walk you through the new feature. Create a Custom PDF Report To access custom reports, log in to your PRO account, select a campaign, and click 'Reports' next to 'Social.' In the ‘Add New Report’ section, you can give your report a title, which is added to the report. You can also give it a description, which is just for you to keep track of your report and won’t be displayed on the report itself. Next, choose how frequently you want your reports to run. Weekly reports will show changes from week to week, while the other options will show changes month over month and quarter over quarter. You can have reports sent to your account email and can also choose to have them sent to alternate email addresses. Next you can begin to build your report. There are five types of information you can add to the report: rankings, crawl diagnostics, on-page, link analysis, and traffic data. We’re working to add social to the report options in the next few months. When you expand a section (like rankings), you can check the sub-sections in order to include them in your report. When you check a sub-section, you’ll have the ability to change the title and description of that section to be printed on the report, add notes, and choose from a few other options. For example, you can choose how many keyword rankings improved to show and for which engine. You can also view an example of how that subsection would look inside the report so you can decide if you’d like to include it or not. The information shown in the example is just sample data and doesn’t reflect your actual campaign information. Once you’ve chosen which sections and subsections to add, click ‘Create Report.' Yay! You created a report! When the report is completed, it will be emailed to you (if you kept that option selected). Weekly reports are sent the day after your rankings are collected each week. Monthly reports are sent by the 2nd of each calendar month. Quarterly reports are sent the first week of each quarter in January, April, July, and October. Manage Reports You can see all the reports you’ve created in the ‘Manage Reports’ section. Here you can also edit or delete a report; find and download reports from previous weeks, months, and quarters; and download the latest version. We love feedback! We hope you enjoy these new custom reports! Please let us know if you have any feedback, feature requests, or experience anything unexpected. You can leave feedback in a comment to this post, or email help@seomoz.org. Happy reporting!! Copied! Back to Top",
