How we select our speakers: We have an internal committee of Mozzers that review every pitch. We analyze each topic to make sure there’s no overlap with our current sessions and to confirm that it’s a good fit for our audience. Next, we look at the entirety of the pitch to help us get a comprehensive idea of what to expect from your talk on the MozCon stage. This is where links to previous decks, content, and videos of past presentations is helpful (but isn’t required). Here’s how to make your pitch stand out: Keep your pitch focused to online marketing. The more actionable the pitch, the better.Be detailed! We want to know the actual tactics our audience will be learning about — not just a vague reference to them. Remember, we receive a ton of pitches, so the more clearly you can explain, the better you’ll stand out. Review the topics already being presented — we’re looking for sessions that are new and that round out our agenda to add to the stage. Brush up on how to prepare for speaking. No pitches will be evaluated in advance, so please don’t ask :)Using social media to lobby your pitch won’t help. Instead, put your time and energy into the actual pitch itself!Linking to a previous example of a slide deck or presentation isn’t required, but it does help the committee a ton.
