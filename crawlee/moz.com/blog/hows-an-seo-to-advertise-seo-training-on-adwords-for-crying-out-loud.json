By: Gabriel Goldenberg April 8, 2008 How's an SEO to Advertise SEO Training on AdWords, For Crying Out Loud?! Search Engines This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Aaaaaaaaaaargh! Here's a conversation I've just had with a Google AdWords support person. It reflects how ridiculous the historical account factor can be in determining quality score. (But then again, Paul showed that the exact same campaign on two different accounts would be rated differently, in terms of Quality Score, so perhaps you vets won't be surprised.) Thank you for contacting Google AdWords. Please hold a moment while we route your chat to a specialist who will help you with your question: \"My ad isn't showing, yet it's more relevant than 6/8 other ads for the keyword, which are obviously using broad match. The quality score says Poor, which I think is responsible, but I've done everything I can to make this as relevant to visitors as possible (which it is, in and of itself). Can I get someone to look this over, please?\". shivani has received your message and will be right with you. [Greetings and account verification edited for privacy/security purposes] shivani: Would you mind waiting a moment while I pull up your account? Gab Goldenberg: sure Gab Goldenberg: Got it? shivani: Yes, I am in your account now. May I know the campaign you are referring to? Gab Goldenberg: SEOmoz Gab Goldenberg: there's only one adgroup so it's pretty simple shivani: Alright. Please hold for a few moments while I look into this. Gab Goldenberg: OK shivani: Thank you for your patience. shivani: The reason your ad is not showing in this campaign is that the bid for your keyword like as well as their Quality Score is low. Gab Goldenberg: your tool shows me that I need to bid between $1 and $2 to show up in positions 1-3 for phrase match, and 4-6 for exact match! Gab Goldenberg: and the ads and landing page are really relevant... have a look for yourself shivani: I understand. shivani: Are you referring to the Keyword Tool, Gab? Gab Goldenberg: the sandbox or whatever it's called Gab Goldenberg: https://adwords.google.com/select/TrafficEstimatorSandbox... Gab Goldenberg: shows 2.60 - 3.70 for positions 1-3 Gab Goldenberg: so I should be able to get 4-6 at $2! Gab Goldenberg: and besides, look at the other ads for that keyword Gab Goldenberg: they're broad matched, and mostly not even advertising seo Gab Goldenberg: SEO Analysis 15 Days Free Step by step SEO, keyword and robot analysis with award-winning tool www.ClickTracks.com/15_Days_Free Outsourced SEO $15 hour Cheap Search Engine Optimization Find freelance SEO people worldwide www.SerebraConnect.com Gab Goldenberg: see? shivani: Thank you for clarifying. I see that you mean the Traffic Estimator tool. Gab Goldenberg: Yep shivani: Yes, I saw. shivani: Please know that while the Traffic Estimator is designed to give you keyword traffic and cost estimates at a glance... Gab Goldenberg: So after having seen all that, can you tell me something more precise than the bids and quality score are too low? You've obviously seen that they're more relevant than a lot of what's being advertised shivani: ...Ad positions are not fixed and may vary depending on your CTR, competitor activity, and your keyword's quality. Gab Goldenberg: Ok, but even if that's an estimate Gab Goldenberg: Right, so having seen the competitors, who are broad matching to sell analytics or seo services, and comparing that to my ad and landing page and adgroup which are extremely tightly focused on SEO training... Gab Goldenberg: I can't bid any higher, because it'll kill the ROI Gab Goldenberg: and at the same time it's really aggravating because I know my ads are more relevant shivani: I understand that, Gab. The thing is that due to the dynamic nature of the AdWords system, these estimates may fluctuate shivani: I see that your ads are eligible to appear, but your Ad Rank isn't high enough to place your ad on the first page of search results. shivani: We don't show the same ads on each page, and so, if you click through to the next several pages, you should see your ad. shivani: Now coming to your concern about the ROI, Gab... shivani: ...I see that you are worried that increasing the bid may hamper your ROI. shivani: Let me provide you with some information on how you can increase your ROI substantially. shivani: How can I improve my ROI? (http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=27521 ; I don't want to link to Google for any money.) Gab Goldenberg: You're not really addressing my concern. Gab Goldenberg: Which is that with relevant ads and a relevant landing page Gab Goldenberg: I can't get my ad shown where it matters shivani: I apologize for the inconvenience you have been experiencing, Gab. Gab Goldenberg: And besides which, my ads and landing page do the thing that AdWords page shows shivani: I appreciate that you have ads and landing pages that comply with our policies. Gab Goldenberg: So then why is my quality score \"Poor\"? shivani: I will explain that to you, Gab. Gab Goldenberg: I'm listening :)! shivani: I am glad you smiled! shivani: You see, Quality Score is a dynamic variable assigned to each of your keywords. shivani: It takes into account various factors such as... Gab Goldenberg: I'm smiling because you're patient and doing your best, but I'm also kinda tired as it's 3:30 am here! Gab Goldenberg: factors such as? shivani: the ad's past performance on this and similar sites and historical CTR of the ad. Gab Goldenberg: There's no performance; it's a brand new campaign Gab Goldenberg: Or is that your point? shivani: Since it is a new campaign, we use the historical data of other similar ads and their performance. Gab Goldenberg: similar ads meaning in my account or meaning in AdWords' system? shivani: Our intention is to provide the users with ads that they would be interested in. shivani: In the AdWords system. Gab Goldenberg: Ok, that's nice and all, but no else wrote a review like this before Gab Goldenberg: because the product is new [I was trying to avoid bringing affiliate marketing into this, since my ads and everything else were very relevant]. Gab Goldenberg: and unless I'm completely confused Gab Goldenberg: AdWords is about precise targeting Gab Goldenberg: the more precise your ads are to the keywords Gab Goldenberg: the better your CTR shivani: That's absolutely correct. shivani: While going through your account I found that with some work, your campaigns have the potential to perform way better. Gab Goldenberg: So how in the world does it make sense for broad match ads to show up - unless they're paying through the nose - for seo training when my own ads which are much more precise, don't show up Gab Goldenberg: It's true, my account history sucks. Gab Goldenberg: But this campaign is super targeted Gab Goldenberg: Honestly, do you personally feel that this campaign is less relevant than the other ads showing up? shivani: I'll tell you what. Why don't you try adding more specific keywords to your campaign? Gab Goldenberg: in different adgroups? shivani: Yes though they could be in the same ad group too. Gab Goldenberg: how would that get this adgroup's ads showing though? Gab Goldenberg: that doesn't solve my problem shivani: Let me give you an example. Gab Goldenberg: can I ask you to manually review the quality score on this? Gab Goldenberg: you've said yourself that the ads and lander are precisely targeted Gab Goldenberg: I'm at my wit's end, plus it's nearing 4 am and I'd really like to get testing this campaign already Gab Goldenberg: Have some sympathy for a newb advertiser :) shivani: Alright, I totally understand Gab. Why don't we do this... Let me send you a customized proposal to optimize your account via email. shivani: Through our optimization, we will help your account perform better. Gab Goldenberg: that sounds great Gab Goldenberg: but that'll also take a while to do Gab Goldenberg: How's this? Boost the QS and put a note for it to be reviewed in a month, so I have time to optimize the campaign Gab Goldenberg: then if your predictor tool is right and my ads get no CTR Gab Goldenberg: you can kill the QS back to Poor shivani: The thing is, Gab, the Quality Score cannot be reviewed manually. It is done by our system. Thus, I will not be able to increase your Quality Score for you. Gab Goldenberg: I've got friends who've had it done. Gab Goldenberg: You need to be a big spender for that, I imagine? shivani: Let me assure you that you cannot get a better position in AdWords by paying more. We have a very fair system in place which ensures that the most relevant ads reach the users. Gab Goldenberg: Well that fair system is taking account history and abusing it. Gab Goldenberg: If these were organic search results, my ad would be way ahead of most of those broad matched \"seo\" ads Gab Goldenberg: Because it's more relevant. shivani: I would like to provide you with some information on Landing page quality that will help you and tell you what we look for in a landing page. Gab Goldenberg: I've read all your pages on landing page quality Gab Goldenberg: If you want to email me specifics about my landing page, that would be great Gab Goldenberg: But honestly I don't see what else there could be for you to show me in your FAQ/help that I haven't read. shivani: Landing Page and Site Quality Guidelines (http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=46675) Gab Goldenberg: Read it shivani: I see. shivani: Then, in this case, I'll email you some tips that will help you improve the performance of your account. Gab Goldenberg: great Gab Goldenberg: good night Note: As I'm writing this, I've just done another search and am finally appearing on page 1 (position 6, just below seomen). Very mysterious, I'm sure you'll agree, especially considering that moments earlier, Shivani said, \"I see that your ads are eligible to appear, but your Ad Rank isn't high enough to place your ad on the first page of search results.\" And also considering that it can't be changed manually. I'd love to hear you bigshot inhouse advertisers, PPC managers, and affiliate marketers (and anyone else with a clue as to what's going on) chime in. What the hell is wrong SEOmoz Pro Review .com?? (Ugliness aside; AdWords to date has no 'prettiness requirement' and anyways that would be compensated by the genuisness of my page.) Copied! Back to Top",
