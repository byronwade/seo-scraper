Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin October 24, 2007 Google Toolbar PageRank Losses For Hundreds of Websites Blogging The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. This morning brings news from around the web of losses to the Google Toolbar PageRank (the little green pixels displayed in the toolbar) for a myriad of sites. The best coverage I've seen comes from Andy Beard, as well as SEJournal and SELand (which has a comprehensive list of sites discussing the update). I've gone through many of the threads and tried to pull together an accounting of websites that have been \"reportedly\" affected by the update. Hopefully, by collecting this data, and combining it with reports in the comments, we can have a relatively comprehensive view of the landscape and make educated guesses and hypotheses as to the root causes: www.autoblog.com PR6 > PR4 www.forbes.com PR7 > PR5 www.engadget.com PR7 > PR5 www.problogger.net PR6 > PR4 www.copyblogger.com PR6 > PR4 www.joystiq.com PR6 > PR4 www.tuaw.com PR6 > PR4 www.searchengineguide.com PR7 > PR4 www.seroundtable.com PR7 > PR4 www.searchenginejournal.com PR7 > PR4 www.johnchow.com PR6 > PR4 www.quickonlinetips.com/PR6 > PR3 weblogtoolscollection.com PR6 > PR4 andybeard.eu PR5 > PR3 www.volodymyrzablotskyy.com PR4 > PR2 daily.stanford.edu PR9 > PR5 www.thecrimson.com PR8 > PR4 www.statcounter.com PR9 > PR6 www.washingtonpost.com PR8 > PR5 www.blogherald.com PR7 > PR4 www.seopedia.org PR6 > PR5 weblogtoolscollection.com PR6 > PR4 www.masternewmedia.org PR7 > PR4 www.sfgate.com PR7 > PR5 www.suntimes.com PR7 > PR5 www.seo-scoop.com PR6 > PR3 spap-oop.blogspot.com PR5 > PR4 Onemansblog.com PR8 > PR5 My personal opinion is that these losses are primarily a result of Google's continuing public relations campaign against paid linking. However, I'm certainly open to other interpretations. Please do leave comments with any sites you know of that have been affected (or information about any of the sites I've listed above that may be inaccurate). Collective data is probably one of the best ways we can assess the situation. Also - at SEOmoz, through our many tools, we have access to tens of thousands of toolbar PageRank scores for different domains. I've asked Jeff & Mel to run through those and request the new data as of today to attempt to identify the quantity of loss. We WILL NOT be exposing individual domains (unless they've already been outed elsewhere - as above), but we can provide an overall snapshot about raw percentages, etc. Jarrod Hunt noted in a comment here that he had seen a PageRank drop across the web, not just on sites selling links, and this should be a good way to verify whether our data matches his. p.s. Please note that I'm not trying to \"out\" anyone for selling links. In fact, I believe there may be sites on that list that have never engaged in paid linking of any kind! I'm merely trying to document PageRank changes for collective study. p.p.s. As Duncan Riley noted on Techcrunch, the AOL-owned Weblogs, Inc. blog network appears to have been affected, while Techcrunch's blog network and rival Gawker media have not. Copied! Back to Top",
