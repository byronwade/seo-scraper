By: BlueflyWebMarketing May 1, 2013 Tips to Improve Your Website's E-Commerce Conversion Rate Even for the Greatest of Skeptics E-Commerce SEO This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Think like a skeptic and you will make more money from your e-commerce website. This is one of the surefire ways to improve your site’s sales and revenues. We use it all the time with our clients, from small businesses to Fortune 500s. When we take on new e-commerce conversion projects, we think about user experience from the perspective of a lot of different personas/user types who may visit your site. One of the most important filters through which we think is the skeptic. As sales people, what do we need to do to encourage skeptical and uneasy people? How can we put them at ease and address their concerns before they even know they are having them? We came up with this list of questions that your users are likely to be subconsciously evaluating from the second they arrive at your site. Your job as a web site optimizer is to make sure your site answers these questions before your users leave your site and go somewhere else. We’ve also included some examples of concepts to resolve some of these concerns that you can put into action today. Look at your e-commerce site from a skeptic’s eyes Open up your site and rate it this way: Imagine you were a new visitor to your site and you had these questions. Give yourself about two seconds to view your site, because in many cases, that is about all the time new site visitors will give you. Ask yourself, how well do you to satisfy these questions? Or how easy is it for people to find these answers? Do I think this (is) a real and good company -- the kind I want to do business with, give my billing info to, etc.? Keep in mind, this is not because you tell them you are a real company, but more the impression you give with your site. Do I think they have what I need? Do I think they will deliver what I need reliably? Do I think they deliver on time? Is delivery/shipping free or inexpensive? If I have a problem, do I think it will be easy to deal with them to resolve my issue? Can I easily return something? Is it free? Do I think they have good/the best/reasonable pricing for the product or service I am seeking? Are they going to spam me if I give them my information? Does it seem that this site is secure? Will they treat my information securely? If clothing: Will this fit me? Will I like it? Do I need it? What do others have to say about this product or service? Can I try it out without committing? Do I need to do this now? This, as with many of these questions, may be thought about differently for different web sites. This may or may not be on your home page, but it may be in messaging throughout the sales process. How to effectively answer these questions on your site Here are some examples related to how you may be able to creatively satisfy your users’ concerns and questions in the split second of their attention they are going to offer you: Is it a real company? or Is it a good company? This is generally about third-party corroboration. Anybody can say they are the best, but awards from prominent or industry associations, a swarm of Facebook followers, saying that you are a business that has been in business since a certain year showing recognizable logos of clients or partners, etc., can help prove it. You see these types of things all the time. It is all about having you feel comfortable as a shopper that this is a real company and a good company. Do I think they have what I need? or if clothing: Will this fit me? Modcloth.com answers these questions well. In addition to size charts and describing whether items will run big or small, Modcloth allows people to post pictures of themselves wearing the clothes along with the measurements, so you can see if it would look good on your body type. Very thoughtful. Do I think they will deliver what I need reliably? or Do I think they deliver on time? or Is delivery/shipping free or inexpensive? Anthropologie.com is very upfront about all costs (if you go into the cart page it lists all costs including shipping and tax, and if they can't calculate one of those yet they put \"tbd\", so you know it's coming and it doesn't seem like they tack it on at the end of the checkout process. Amazon.com offers free, reliable shipping for all purchases totaling $25 or more. What if I have a problem, do I think it will be easy to deal with them to resolve my issue? Check out www.zappos.com. They have awesome service and things like leading with Free Shipping and Free Returns 365 Days a Year- leaves people feeling they will take care of them, and that they are safe to buy here. Are they going to spam me if I give them my information? Even just a note when you sign up for their mailing list or place an order saying that they will not spam you can be reassuring. Does it seem that this site is secure? Will they treat my information securely? Things that can make people feel more secure are the following: SSL encryption Security logos Credentials (BBB, featured media, etc) Do I need it? or Can I try it out without committing? Again, Zappos.com has a very generous returns policy, which they emphasize on their site. In addition, well-written product pages with information about materials, ingredients, etc. can help you decide whether you really need the item. At this point, people know about companies like Zappos, or LandsEnd or REI for their strong return policies. If you are less well known, you may need to work harder to make sure people know you will be a great company to work with. Do I need to do this now? A lot of sites handle this by having promotions or sales. If you go to Bloomingdales, there is always a sale. Limited time offers create urgency. On the other hand, if people know they need something really quick, you can also allay their concerns. Amazon.com will let you know when you place something in your shopping cart how long you have to get the item via two-day shipping or other options if you purchase now. What do others have to say about this product or service? Reviews, both good and bad, are very helpful. For example, Modcloth.com allows reviews on all products and the reviews aren't always glowing -- some products have one or two star ratings. Typically the really bad reviews get a public reply from a staff member who will apologize and mention their return/exchange policy. Do they have the best pricing? Some companies offer a Best Price Guarantee and stamp it right on the site. Even if the user does not shop around, this gives them comfort that you are oriented around giving the best pricing and if they find it for cheaper you would match, particularly if you offer to match any better price even up to 30 days after their purchase. Or some people may have a value proposition right in their tagline, for example, High Fashion at Affordable Prices. Or you may be a luxury brand and want to steer away from this. Think about your audience, and take what makes sense for you from this article. Will I like it? Some of the best ways to deal with this are other customer reviews and good information. It is critical not to overwhelm people with too much information as it is easy to lose someone with information overload. But at the same time, have the information available for those who want to seek it. Review these questions, think from this place and get creative. If you do this right, you will win over your greatest skeptics and increase your conversion. Let us know how it goes! Copied! Back to Top",
