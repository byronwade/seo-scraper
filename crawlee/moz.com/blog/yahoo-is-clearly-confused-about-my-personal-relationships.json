By: Rand Fishkin February 27, 2007 Yahoo! is Clearly Confused About My Personal Relationships Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Just a short one that Mystery Guest pointed out to me in a huff tonight - Yahoo! search team, I think you owe her some apologetic flowers after this one. Her exact words after showing me this search were \"do you love her?\": \"Vanessa Fox Fishkin\"? Really? Yahoo!, you've gone too far this time. Search engines should find things for you, not put you in the doghouse with your new fiancée. On a serious note, though, I have to say that I'm more than a little impressed with Yahoo!'s algorithmic upgrades. Their search results rival, and in some cases, exceed the quality I get at Google. Visiting with Si in New Jersey over the weekend, he commented that he barely visits Google anymore, since Yahoo! is his homepage and he now gets a satisfactory search result almost every time with them. I'm trying to convince Si to start commenting on the blog, despite his shy nature (at least, on the web). UPDATE - Yahoo! kindly apologized. Copied! Back to Top",
