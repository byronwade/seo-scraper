Table of Contents Copied! By: Scott Willoughby May 10, 2007 Whether DNC or RNC, Political Candidates need SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Due to the first round of Presidential Candidate pre-primary debates occuring recently, I decided to have a poke around and see what the State of the SERPs is like for the major 2008 Presidential hopefuls. I was surprised to find that, despite Howard Dean's major success with online fundraising in 2004, and the vast popularity of political blogs and web-centric PACs like MoveOn.org, many of the 2008 Candidates are committing huge SEO blunders. I know SEO is a fairly young industry and not everyone is hip to optimization techniques, but considering the reach and importance of the internet to young, vocal, passionate voters, writers and opinion leaders, one would think the masterminds behind these multi-million dollar marketing schemes campaigns would know of and appreciate the importance of search marketing. Take the mind-boggling case of John McCain, a likely GOP front-runner: McCain's active campaign site currently ranks #68 at Google for \"john mccain\" and just as abysmally for other terms and iterations of his name. How could this be? Well, behind his senate.gov profile page (which he can't use for campaigning) and his Wikipedia entry, we find www.straighttalkamerica.com, Mr. McCain's campaign site from the 2000 primary. As you'll notice, the Title Tag directs us to go to his new site, but, since it doesn't rank, we can't click through to it from the same SERP. If we go to his old site, we're not 301'd, but rather instructed to click through to his new site. If ever (EVER!) there was a case for 301-ing a domain, this is it. Granted, McCain's new site has its own problems, most glaring is that every single page uses the same title and meta description tags, and navigation is primarily via drop-down java script menus. As such, most of his pages are likely ending up in the Supplemental Index making his internal links worthless. Let me also point out that even the search \"john mccain 2008\" puts his new site #3 behind www.stopjohnmccain2008.com and his Wikipedia page. He does, however, have AdWords for his new site on the SERPs for every imaginable incarnation of his name. On the flip side of this equation is Barack Obama's site which is a redesign of his domain from his 2004 Senate bid. Nicely designed and fairly well optimized, he is the only candidate that ranks for such lofty keywords as \"ending iraq war\" (#10 on Google) and \"2008 election\" (#11) [Update: as of this morning, 5/10, Google is showing Dennis Kucinich at #8 for \"ending iraq war\"]. However, for these and other campaign specific keywords such as \"candidate,\" \"2008 election,\" \"united states presidential election,\" and \"democratic candidates\" or \"republican candidates,\" none of the current contenders are even in the top 50 at Google. Two notable exceptions are Hillary Clinton and Dennis Kucinich (possibly carrying links and domain strength from his '04 run) who both rank in the top 15 for the term \"president\". Fine, it's early, maybe people are still looking for candidates by name only. After all, dark horse candidate Ron Paul (R) and Mike Gravel (D) have gotten tons of attention on the social media sites lately. Unfortunately, the data just doesn't back it up. Despite 12 stories on Digg featuring Ron Paul in the headline, each receiving more than 1000 diggs, since he announced his candidacy on March 12, 2007--Mike Gravel's been featured in nine 1000+ digg stories since announcing on March 9th--the search queries for his name pale in comparison to the big players who, oddly enough, get almost no love from Digg (Obama's headlined in only two 1000+ digg stories since March 9th, same with Clinton). While \"Hillary Clinton\" and \"Barack Obama\" get significant daily numbers as search terms (Clinton currently getting about 50% more volume than Obama), the rest of the candidates don't get much love at all. John Edwards gets about 1/3rd of Clinton's search volume, as does McCain. Even social media darlings Paul and Gravel are averaging only a relative handful of name searches daily. As far as traffic goes, things are pretty much the same, with the exception of a distinct inversion between Obama and Clinton. The chart below shows the relative search volumes for the names of the major candidates (data from Keyword Discovery) as well as their relative Alexa Traffic Rank (3 mos. avg.) to their official campaign sites. Granted, the search numbers aren't huge for the more general, campaign-related terms, but in most cases they're more popular than candidate names and have a much longer tail. So what's it come down to? It seems the vast majority of candidates have little to no idea of the importance of keyword research, keyword targeting or even basic, on-page SEO practices. I strongly believe that the Internet is going to play a huge role in the 2008 election. I also believe, after examining the current offerings by the major players, that the candidate that attacks the SERPs now, and positions themselves to rank for campaign-related and issue-related keywords will have a huge advantage in disseminating their beliefs and dominating the conversation. UPDATE: Jonah Stein has published a great follow-up to this article, Political Search Marketing: Electronic Grass Roots, over at Alchemist Media. He offers an excellent analysis of how political campaigns and operatives could and should use the power of SEO/SEM to market their campaigns, marshal grassroots support and inform voters. Perhaps more importantly, he discusses how the campaigns, the engines, and the public need to be vigilant to avoid the potential for unscrupulous use that could make the internet the most effective catapult for political mudslinging and disinformation.
