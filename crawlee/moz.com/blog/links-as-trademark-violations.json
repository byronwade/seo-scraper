This week I've been link building for a new client, a key part of which involves development around specific company names and specific company products.And it got me thinking as to whether link development could be next in line for trademark infringement suits.In this instance, I don't think there's any danger as these are products/services openly resold via third-parties.But it made me wonder if there isn't a case on the way.Such as where a company considers it an infringement to use registered trademarked terms in links, which point to webpages outside of the control of the trademark company?We've already seen the issue arise in PPC - which is a more mainstream market.And as if on cue, Greywolf posts that links to online media files have been ruled as copyright infringements.So does that mean that if general link development were to go mainstream, that trademark infringement matters could invade here, too?
