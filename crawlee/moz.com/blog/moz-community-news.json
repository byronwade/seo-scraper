By: Gabriel Goldenberg February 8, 2008 Moz Community News Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. SEOmoz has one of the best communities around, and I want to invite my fellow Moz members to get together at SMX. Besides that, I've also got some cool things to share with you about your fellow members here. The calendar already has SMX West marked (albeit for a single day?), but only a few people seem to be attending besides the moz staff. Here's what I'd like to ask: Leave a comment here to let us know if you've reserved a spot Tell us when your best availability is for getting together/hanging out/partying Share what panels you're most interested in attending Add your name to the calendar event if you haven't already. Besides that, I've got a couple of fun things to share about our community: 1) John Kelly of SureHits (insurance and loan lead generation) will be speaking on a PPC panel on decrypting quality scores. I thought I knew this stuff. But after Google gave me lower required CPCs on a massive 'dump all the KWs here' adgroup than on a break-out adgroup featuring keywords from the initial group that were semantically related, I feel a bit lost. Count on me to be there. Incidentally, if any of you are interested in the PPC aspect of the presidential campaigns, I can tell you that there's dirt cheap keywords that none of them are using, even though the intent is bang on the money for conversion. And if any of you have hookups or a hookup to a hookup, please let 'em know that I'd love to work on one of the Presidential search campaigns. (By the way, John, your site's favicon looks like a yellow Tie Fighter.) 2) Vinny Goldsmith (the prolific commenter, aka vingold) is looking to get into the SEO business more seriously. He's got some nice experience working real estate and local campaigns, for you fellow practitioners who are into that stuff. 3) You guys are some of the best traffic I get. SEOmoz traffic is great SEOmoz traffic. 4) Most of that StumbleUpon traffic is from Annie, the SEO [Consulting] Smarty and keyword researcher. I think she's gonna be the next one of us to get a spot on an SMX panel (for social, natch) if she keeps that rhythm up! 5) Rand (or one of the other staff members) was generous enough to share an awesome tip on building a great community. Very insightful! 6) Sarah \"May it please the Mozzers\" Bird will be on the legal panel, day 1. That's gonna be another hot panel, judging by her posts here and some of her co-panelists. 7) Ben Hanna will also be on a panel; this one's about searcher behaviour. (I wonder what it's like being VP of marketing at a marketing company. Seems like the peanut gallery might get a little loud at times, hehe ;).) 8) Yours truly got onto the local panel. If you want to hear about how I got two spots in Google using local [before that was standard], check it out :) Until then, you may like to read more about the latest on Google Maps SERPs. 9) If I may [warning: self promotion upcoming], do come by and share whether your SEO Consultant type is Good, Rad (Rand?), or Sexy. Free dofollow links to all good commenters there :D. My guess is that most of the SEOmozzers who come by will identify in the Good or Rad categories. Copied! Back to Top",
