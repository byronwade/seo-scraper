By: Ruth Burr Reedy July 31, 2012 New Contest - Get Your Video on the New SEOmoz YouTube Channel! Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. UPDATE: The deadline to enter this contest has been extended to Friday, August 17th! Howdy Mozzers! We're excited to announce the new SEOmoz YouTube channel! Check it out at http://www.youtube.com/moz. We'll be adding a bunch of our video content from the last couple of years, including Whiteboard Friday and our just-for-fun videos like Aaron's First Day. Going forward, you'll be able to view SEOmoz videos on the YouTube channel a few days after they debut here on the site. We'll also be doing special YouTube-only content, presentations, and contests - like this one! The SEOmoz YouTube Contest: \"1 Tool/Tactic, 2 Minutes\" A few words from Rand on the contest: Here's the rundown: Create a 2-minute video on your favorite inbound marketing tool or tactic. You've got 2 minutes to tell the SEOmoz community why this one thing is awesome and how to use it to get real marketing results. Your video can be as simple as you talking into your webcam ZeFrank-style, or as complicated and special-effects-y as you care to make it, but it can't be longer than 2 minutes! We'll be selecting winning videos in the following categories: Content Marketing Google Updates Link Building Social Media Analytics APIs SEO Secrets Email/Outreach Conversion Rate Optimization The winning videos will be selected based on how informative, entertaining, and actionable they are (infotainable?). Winners will get their videos featured on our YouTube channel (along with a link and shoutout in the video description) and will also win an SEOmoz swag bag! Entries are subject to the SEOmoz Community Etiquette & Disclaimer. Videos must be original content that are not previously posted anywhere else. To enter: Make a video! 2 minutes or less. Label the video file with the video's title PLUS your SEOmoz username. This is how we will know it's from you (ex: if I were submitting \"Twitter for Links,\" an example file name would be: TwitterForLinks_ruthburr) Upload the video using the \"upload your video\" button below. Make sure the file name has the your SEOmoz username, or we won't know it's from you. When you click the button below, you'll be prompted to upload your video - simply select the file you want and click \"Open.\" You'll see a progress bar letting you know how long you've got left for the video to upload, and when it's complete you'll see a message saying your upload is completed. The uploader may run a bit slow depending on your connection speeds, so please be patient. Ready to upload? Let us have it: Submit your video by Wednesday, August 15th Due to popular demand, we're extending the deadline - you now have until Friday, August 17th to submit your video. We'll start announcing the winners on Tuesday, August 21st and will release a new winning video on our YouTube channel every weekday until all the winners have been announced. Copied! Back to Top",
