Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin October 3, 2007 Across the Web & A Day in the Life SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I'm combining two short blogs into one tonight - hey, it's easier for you to read and me to write, so why not, right? First off, I wanted to do a roundup of some of the great material that's popped up over the past few days: Click FRAUD!! Andrew Goodman wrote an excellent piece on the subject at Traffick, and it reminded me that this old blog post from MindValleyLabs (who just launched SocialRank) was a must-read as well - Is Fraud Rampant on Google's Content Ad Network? Yahoo! did an impressive upgrade to their search results and the search functionality from their homepage - mirroring the rollout of MSN/Live's upgraded search functionality (which we'll be reporting on later in the week). To help us understand how Yahoo! changes might affect SEO, and specifically keyword demand and targeting, Joost De Valk wrote a post on Yahoo!'s Search Assist & Tracking Keywords. What does Techmeme's leaderboard (and, more importantly, the thousands of bloggers linking to it) tell us about viral content in the 'sphere? Easy - bloggers are obsessed with reputation and ranking and anything that plays on that ego will attract an incredibly amount of links & traffic. Aaron's post on exploiting passion for profit is easily one of the SEO world's best reads this month (I know, I know - we're only 3 days in) Happy 40th, Brian... Is it really the new 20? If so, I'm worried about Copyblogger being overrun by rampaging frat boys. I actually found a good number of very interesting sites on PC Mag's Top 100 Undiscoverd Websites list. I almost wish that someone would cover \"up and comers\" in the web world every month... On last thing - for goodness sake, DO NOT MISS SMX Social Media in New York on October 16-17. Rebecca and I will both be speaking there on multiple panels, plus you can get a discount on SEOmoz membership if you attend (or, if you're already a premium member, we're giving you 10% off the show price in the premium discount store). The reason I'm so excited for SMX Social is simple - I think it's going to be one of the first conferences where 65%+ of the material will be completely new - Facebook apps, Bribing Wikipedia editors, tactics that still work for getting on Digg, etc. And now, to part 2 of the post. I actually saw this spiffy graph via Lisa and thought - I should make one of those to reflect what my weeks usually look like. An Average Week in the Life of Rand Here's the raw stats for those can't live without the numbers: Reading Blogs, News Sites & Forums 7.00% Consulting w/ Clients 6.00% Answering Email 50.00% Company Internal Meetings 2.00% Crafting + Giving Presentations 4.00% Blogging 12.00% Answering Premium Q+A 5.00% Setting SEOmoz Strategy 1.00% Contracts & Finances 1.00% Travel Time 4.00% Tool & Content Design 2.00% Social Media & Blog Participation 3.00% Non-client, Industry Meetings & Events 3.00% I actually found this to be an interesting excercise, and one that made me realize how badly I need more help with my email. p.s. We found out the genius responsible for the Brock Sampson linkbait last night - I think he deserves his own case study, and possibly an interview, too Sadly, he's already working at another SEO company - and one that we probably need to add to our recommended list :) p.p.s. As always - let us know what we missed in the comments (and feel free to link out). Copied! Back to Top",
