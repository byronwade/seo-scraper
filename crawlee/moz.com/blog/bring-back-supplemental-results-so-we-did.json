By: Peter Newsome July 23, 2007 Bring back supplemental results... so we did. Search Engines This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Over the past couple of weeks, most SEO blogs have made mention of Google removing their supplemental results search feature. Rand asked nicely in his post: Google - Please Bring Back the Supplemental Results Query; It's Incredibly Valuable, but from some of Matt Cutts' comments, it doesn't look like this will happen. Rand's argument is that if we can easily see the supplemental results, we're able to fix those pages, making the job easier for Google, whilst Matt Cutts says that the tool was removed because Google didn't want people to get fixated on the supplemental results instead of focusing on more important aspects of SEO, like good content. Both make good points, and we could debate who is right or wrong for hours, but at the end of the day people seem to be missing the ability to easily view their supplemental results, and I felt something had to be done about it. So, we have created a tool that brings back the functionality that Google took away - SiteMost's Google Supplemental Results Tool. Please use this tool responsibly to find issues within your own (or your client's) sites, and like Matt says - don't get fixated on this one aspect of SEO, as there are a lot of pieces that make-up the Google ranking puzzle.
