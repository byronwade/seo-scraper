By: Rand Fishkin September 27, 2005 Seeking Contributors Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. With EGOL and I the loan wolves running SEOmoz, I think it's time to find some new talent to write for the site. SEOmoz, as you know, doesn't deliver copies of the daily headlines (although we occassionally give our take on big news). We're more focused on providing specific, daily tips and information that SEO/Ms and webmastesr can use in their site optimization efforts. If you're someone who reads this site regularly and would enjoy contributing 1-2 times a week (just for the notoriety - it's an unpaid position), please send me an e-mail. I'd prefer folks who are already known in the industry - via forums, comments, etc. and someone whose attitude and focus can be consistently professional and friendly. Likewise, if you'd like to nominate someone, just write in their name in the comments. p.s. Please don't feel bad if we say no thanks - I'm even picky when it comes to who advertises at SEOmoz! p.p.s Why the slow posting? I'm at home sick with some sort of cold/flu... It's no fun at all.
