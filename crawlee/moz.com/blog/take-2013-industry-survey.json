Marketing Industry By: Cyrus Shepard October 23, 2013 The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Table of Contents Copied! By: Cyrus Shepard October 23, 2013 Take the 2013 Moz Industry Survey: Share Your Voice! Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Update: We've now released the full results. Check it out here: 2014 Industry Survey We're very excited to announce the 2013 Moz Industry Survey is ready to take. This is the fourth edition of the survey, which started in 2008 as the SEO Industry Survey and only ran every two years. So much has changed since the last survey that we thought it was important to run it anew in order to gain fresh insights. Some of what we hope to learn and share: Who works in inbound marketing and SEO today? What tactics and tools are most popular? Where are marketers spending their dollars? What does the future of the industry hold? This year's survey was redesigned to be easier and only take 5-10 minutes. When the results are in we'll share the data freely with you, our partners, and the rest of the world. Prizes It wouldn't be the Industry Survey without a few excellent prizes thrown in as an added incentive. This year we've upped the game with prizes we feel are both exciting and perfect for the busy inbound marketer. To see the full sweepstakes terms and rules, go to our sweepstakes rules page. The winners will be announced by June 4th. Follow us on Twitter to stay up to date. Grand Prize: Attend MozCon 2014 in Seattle + Flight + Hotel + Lunch with an industry expert Come see us Mozzers in Seattle! The Grand Prize includes one ticket to MozCon 2014 plus airfare and accommodations. We'll also arrange a one-on-one lunch for you with an industry expert. 2 First Prizes: iPad 2 We're giving away two separate iPad 2s. 10 Second Prizes: $100 Amazon.com gift cards Yep, 10 lucky people will win $100 Amazon.com gift cards. Why not buy yourself a nice book? Why the survey is important By comparing answers and predictions from one year to the next, we can spot trends and gain insight not easily reported through any other source. This is our best chance to understand exactly where the future of our industry is headed. Some of the things we hope to learn: Demographics: Who is practicing inbound marketing and SEO today? Where do we work and live? Agencies vs. in-house vs. other: How are agencies growing? What's the average size? Who is doing inbound marketing on their own? Tactics and strategies: What's working for people today? How have strategies and tactics evolved? Tools and technology: What are marketers using to discover opportunities, promote themselves, and measure the results? Budget and spending: What tools and platforms are marketers investing in? Every year the Industry Survey delivers new insights and surprises. For example, the chart below (from the 2012 survey) lists average reported salary by role. Will it change in 2013? 2012 SEO Industry Survey Thanks to our partners Huge thanks to our partners who are helping to spread the word and encouraging their audience to participate in the survey. We'd especially like to give special recognition to Search Engine Land, Buffer, aimClear, SEOverflow, CopyBlogger, Econsultancy, Content Marketing Institute, TopRank Marketing, MarketingProfs, HootSuite and Entreprenuer.com, Distilled and Hubspot. Sharing is caring The number of people who take the survey is very important! The more people who take the survey, the better and more accurate the data will be, and the more insight we can share with the industry. So please share with your co-workers. Share on social media. Share with your email lists. You can use the buttons below this post to get you started, but remember to take the survey first! Copied! Back to Top",
