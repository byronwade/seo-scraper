Note: If you are unaware of The Project topic, please read the previous parts The Project: pt1 , pt2, pt3I usually have a pretty good hunch of future PR updates, and it was accurate this time also. For some odd reason they seem to have some sort of *mystic connection* with my calendar (or then I'm just always too busy to follow updates closely).... So it's official, the little green bar is updated and the project website has moved from PR0 to PR5. So how was it done? Here's the short brief (as I'm supposed to help on the move, not to surf on the web ;) These project follow up posts contain a single link (that 4 links this one included); What most people miss in link hunting, is the possibility to utilize existing real life networks. If you are an expert or associated with something, then there is a good possibility you already have the required personal connections, that provide access to write articles etc on 3rd party (successful) websites. Utilize them. Our main site has 2 links; I think this is pretty obvious. If this was a client site, then this would not be an option due to NDA's. Some PR5-6 blogs have linked to site with their posts (100% organic); These are from very diversified topics, and IMO they just show off what a good content can do. People liked about the topic of page, and they also linked to it. Lots of constantly changing feed / tag based links; I think this is the main benefits of syndication from SEO perspective. Surprisingly there are several high quality EDU-sites providing feed/tag based links to their readers. And if you happen to operate on niche keywords, there is a possibility that these links last for months. Few directory etc. submissions; This is something I'd call the usual link scavenging. Especially with new sites the policy of focusing on quality instead of quantity works IMO better. Like always, feel free to share your opinions and favourite methods on achieving more link juice.
