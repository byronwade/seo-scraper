The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Search Engine Optimization: The Loudest Voice Wins Put yourself in the shoes of a small business owner. Think of how large the rest of the world is and how miniscule you are in comparison. Consider just how important it is to elevate your marketing message above the competing noise and to reach a single potential customer. In an environment as robust and expansive as the internet, users have only one tool to locate information, products, and services—the search engine. Search engine optimization is the art and science of publishing information and marketing it in a manner that helps search engines understand exactly what your information is and what search terms, or keywords, are relevant to your content—enabling you to reach more potential customers and users. It’s not all about quantity.
