In the past, we've shown the top community members by sheer number of comments. We don't want, however, to imply that being prolific is necessarily good within itself. So, we added up all the thumbs-up that each comment on our blogs has received, and figured out which community members racked up the most thumbs over the course of the year. (We've intentionally omitted staff members and associates from this list, as they'd stack the deck pretty heavily!) The graphics to the right of each community member show the number of comments they've left on blog posts in 2014 as well as the total number of thumbs up those comments have received. This list is truly an illustration of how amazing the Moz community is. This site would hardly be anything without all of you, and we so appreciate your involvement on such a regular basis! 1.
