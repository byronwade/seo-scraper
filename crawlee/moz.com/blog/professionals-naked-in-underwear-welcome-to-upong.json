Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin November 18, 2005 Professionals... Naked & In Underwear? Welcome to UPONG Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. ISOS has done it again. Hot on the heels of SEMPO and SMA-NA, the Underpanters now have their own organisation: Underpanter Professionals and Openly Naked Guild, aka UPONG. Dedicated to serving Underpanters unique needs, UPONG’s goal is to unite the Underpanters of the SEM community, a group long shunned and overlooked by mainstream organisations, and provide them with tools designed to help spotlight the industry. The goals of the group are simple, according to founding president, Michael Motherwell. “Our goal is to take the great SEM unwashed, the Underpanters, and represent them when and where no one else will, to stand up for their rights to sit around in their undies (or less) and do what they do best, without the need to resort to clothes.” And from their latest press release: With the release of their latest product, everyone’s favourite imaginary organisaton, UPONG, have achieved a world’s first: the first ever release of an Ironic product. “As an organisation dedicated to Underpanters and Openly Nakeds, we decided that the obvious choice of clothing to release (undies or a thong / G String), just wasn’t our style”, El Presidente Motherwell said. “No obvious product release here. Oh no. Nothing so painstakingly linear. We mixed it up. We went all Artsy and Avant Garde on you. You could even say we have broken new ground for imaginary organisations anywhere. That’s right, we did it: we released a T-Shirt. Bet you didn’t see that coming now, did you, eh?” No one else in the office seems to \"get it\", but I'm rolling out of my chair.
