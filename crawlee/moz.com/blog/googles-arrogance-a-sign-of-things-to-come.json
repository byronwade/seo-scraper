By: Rand Fishkin May 3, 2006 Google's Arrogance - A Sign of Things to Come Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. These search result counts threw me for a loop: \"microsoft's arrogance\" - 1,380 results \"yahoo's arrogance\" - 7,980 results \"google's arrogance\" - 26,500 results That's not to say that these search counts have any real meaning - Microsoft has more counts for hubris than Google does (although many of these seem to be pre-2000). Numbers in the search results can be skewed any which way a blogger/reporter/publisher chooses. But, after some talks today with folks who deal with Google on a business level (and used to work with them in the investment sphere), it's clear that the sentiment is largely the same. Google's defining characteristics for many professionals in the web search, Internet, business and investing fields is not a positive one. While we all admire Google's progress and continued dominance of their sector, it's hard not to predict a fallout reminiscient of the dot-com's, given the industry perception. I can't think of a firm that's survived a rise like Google's without some karmic retribution for internal arrogance. If anyone can break the mold, they can, and it may well be that this is a carefully orchestrated (though inexplicable) PR move, but those slimy know-it-all smiles on product managers really seem to piss off the folks I talk to...
