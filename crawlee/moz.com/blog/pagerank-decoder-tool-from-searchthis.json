By: Rand Fishkin June 16, 2005 PageRank Decoder Tool from Search-This Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Mark, over at Search-This.com e-mailed me today about a great new Flash-based tool called the PageRank Decoder that SEOs can use to determine the impact of particular links between pages on their respective PageRanks. It's fun, visual and informative - even though PageRank is a largely useless measurement for rankings. I'm looking forward to seeing more from his site and his development work - he's got a great site and if the PageRank decoder is any indication, a very savvy idea of how to build great content for links.
