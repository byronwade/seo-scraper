By: Rebecca Kelley July 16, 2007 Monday Odds and Ends SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. And now, a little roundup of stories from the past few days that have either been brought to my attention or that I came across and thought were interesting: Agustín Vazquez-Levi (whose Canalytics team recently became the 12th company in North America [and the first company in Canada] to be accepted as one of Google's Google Analytics Authorized Consultants) wrote a post about how he submitted a link to Mahalo and saw it appear in a non-related page result; thus, he inadvertently (but easily) spammed Mahalo. He pointed it out to the site admin, and what was Oggy's reward for being so honest and helpful? He got his link removed, of course. Maholo, indeed! EGOL sent me this article about Google's quest to know more about us than we know ourselves. In a recent interview, Eric Schmidt stated that \"The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the question such as 'What shall I do tomorrow?' And 'What job shall I take?' \" Would anyone else be surprised if the answer to both questions was \"Viagra\"? Lisa Barone is a big fat liar, because she said that \"Your Boss is Not Your Friend.\" Rand is totally my friend! Sure, lately he'd rather hang out with Googlers than his Mini-Me, and okay, sometimes when I ask him non-work stuff (\"Hey, how was your weekend buddy?\") he barks \"Go write a blog entry!\" at me, but we're still as close as ever... Next Thursday and Friday (July 26 and 27) is SES Travel Edition right here in sunny and hot/cool and gray (depending on the hour) Seattle. Rand will be out of town, so I have the pleasure of speaking on two panels, Travel Writing & Content Creation and Pack Your Tool Bag: Widgets, APIs, Maps & More. Matt McGee talks about Sphinn (spin? spfinn? spin-NUH? damn this web 2.0 spelling!) and the \"Sphinn Effect\" (the traffic bump he got as a result of one of his blog posts appearing on the front page of Sphinn). My question is: Are top Sphinn users called sphinnsters? Do they wear sphinndex shorts while watching Sphinnderella and eating sphinnach? Okay, I'm done now. There you go--five quick little nuggets of easy-to-digest bits of information. I'll try to feed you all something heartier later this week. Copied! Back to Top",
