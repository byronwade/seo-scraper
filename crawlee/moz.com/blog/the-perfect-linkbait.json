L By: LarsBachmann May 16, 2008 The Perfect Linkbait Link Building This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I have received a lot of high quality information from SEOmoz, and now I think it's time to give something back. This is my first blog post on SEOmoz, and it's gonna be short, but worth reading. You all know how fun it can be to create the perfect linkbait, and here is an easy way to do it. I made a post called \"present game\" (I'm not sure this is the right word in English, though). The whole idea is that you write a post saying that you wanna start a fun present game, and if you want to participate, just write a comment saying so. And once you have some comments (that usually don't take long), you pick one and send the \"winner\" a present. But here come the rules. Indyour post, you write a list just like this: 1. (Link to your blogpost), then 2. 3. etc... This can go as high as you want, but I made mine to 10. And whoever receives the package has to copy the list and the rules made by you in his or her blog post, and then add the URL of the post on to the next number (in this case, number 2). And then the winner writes a couple of words about the present you send them, and then encourages his or her readers to make a comment so that there can be found a new blogger who can receive the next present. I made my rules so that the last one on the list has to send a present back to the first on the list, and the value of the present has to be between $30-50 USD. As this little fun game continuous, you will get a link on every blog that participates in the game because you are the first on the list. Imagine that you make this with a 100-list, then all you have to do is write a post, send a present to someone, and then just wait to receive 100 links and a present. Good luck with your present/linkbait game ;) Copied! Back to Top",
