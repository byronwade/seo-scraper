The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. One link acquisition strategy we and many other agencies deploy for our clients is the use of infographics. Over time, a well designed and promoted infographic will attract many Tweets, Facebook Likes, Diggs, Stumbles, +1s, and backlinks which help a sites pages rank higher in the SERPs. As an SEO, I am always looking for ways to repurpose any content I have to help me acquire more backlinks and more visibility online, this is no different for infographics. In this post, I’d like to discuss a few easy ways to repurpose your graphics quickly, distribute them, and acquire some great links to strengthen your backlink portfolio. I will go into each method below. Turn Your Graphic Into Smaller Images As we all know, infographics are large images that contain a lot of information for an individual to digest. One easy way to repurpose your graphic is to chop it up into smaller images that can be shared on sites like Flickr, Photobucket, SmugMug, and many other image sharing sites. Using simple screen capture software like Jing, you can take each thought or data point in the graphic and turn them into individual images. Create a profile on the sites mentioned above and drop a link back to your website. Each image uploaded will link back to your main profile, strengthening the link on that page, and some of the sites allow links in the description area on the page the image lives on. You will also be able to use these smaller images in my next example. Turn Your Graphic Into A Power Point Presentation Once you have your individual images created, the next way to repurpose your content is cake. Take those images and create a slide deck in Power Point adding one image to each slide in chronological order so that it tells the same story as the graphic as a whole does. You'll want to make sure to add context where needed and also brand the slides with your or your client's logo. When finished, you can take the finished Power Point presentation and add it to sites like DocStoc, Slideshare, Scribd and others. Turn Your Graphic Into A Video The last way to repurpose infographic content is by far my favorite. Creating videos out of your graphics and distributing them on sites like YouTube, Vimeo, and Metacafe is another way to create additional visibility and drive traffic to any web property. It's also a great way to build credible, diverse backlinks to your website. These videos can be created in one of two ways. The easiest way is to take the Power Point presentation mentioned above, take your Jing screen capture software, and walk through each slide in the presentation explaining the data. This method is often less appealing to its viewers because of the presentation format, but gets the job done without much additional effort. The other way to create videos from infographics is by taking Jing, capturing pieces of the graphic, and moving the capture area throughout the graphic explaining the data. This method is much more appealing to viewers because it feels more interactive as you move seamlessly from data point to data point instead of just flipping through slides with images on them. These videos will not only provide some backlinks, but they will also drive traffic to your site that is qualified and often times ready to buy your products or services. If you have to choose one of the methods above, I believe this method has the highest return on time invested. These are just a few of the ways to repurpose your infographic content. By putting forth additional effort after a graphic is created and promoted, you can acquire some pretty decent links and generate more visibility for your own site or the sites of your clients.
