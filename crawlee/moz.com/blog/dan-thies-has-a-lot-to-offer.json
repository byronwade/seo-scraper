Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin October 25, 2005 Dan Thies has A Lot to Offer SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I contracted out a keyword research report from Dan Thies yesterday afternoon (hard to believe they're only $99) and spoke a little on the phone. Dan has a lot of cool stuff coming up, including a limited engagement for an SEO Coaching that includes time on the phone, email consultation, access to video training materials and more for $595... But, guess what? Since I was so friendly with Dan on the phone, I've obtained $100 off coupons for SEOmoz readers - just follow this link and you'll get it for $495. Pretty sweet, huh? Who do I recommend this to? Well, everyone, actually. I'll most likely have someone from SEOmoz taking the course and if you think there might be areas of keyword research, link building or content generation that are lacking in your SEO toolkit, $495 is a small price to pay. I've spent several hours talking to Dan, mostly over meals involving steak or fish, and always come away with dozens of implementable tidbits. Just reviewing his list of posts at HighRankings, you can see why he's so good at what he does. Last, there's a taste for those who need one - a 75 minute free video that you can download which offers insight in a classroom type environment on keyword strategies. Watch it and you'll see how much further this single segment of SEO can be taken. Copied! Back to Top",
