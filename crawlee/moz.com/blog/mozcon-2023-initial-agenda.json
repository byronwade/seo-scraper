Chris Long (he/him) VP of Marketing, Go Fish Digital @GoFishChris | @GoFishDigital Why SEOs Need To Start Playing Offense Instead of Defense In an industry overloaded with data, tools, algorithm changes, and a constantly evolving landscape, it's tough to know what to prioritize. Often, this leads SEO initiatives and strategies to be more reactive instead of proactive. In this session, Chris will show you how to shift to an offensive SEO mindset. This will help you better prioritize key initiatives, get stakeholder buy-in, and navigate a successful long-term SEO strategy. You'll leave this session understanding how to identify new markets to break into, leverage SEO data around key recommendations, utilize keyword segmentation to better inform your SEO strategy, and build a framework for setting up SEO experiments. Crystal Carter (she/her) Head of SEO Communications, Wix@CrystalontheWeb | @wix Views on Views of Video SEO Fifty-four percent of consumers report that they'd like to see more videos from brands, and video SERPs account for an average of 20% of untapped keyword opportunities.

Jason Dodge (he/him) Founder & CEO | Black Truck Media + Marketing@dodgejd Rethink Your Industry Pages - They‚Äôre Not What You Think B2B marketers, and SEOs alike, are all too quick to create industry-specific landing pages for every single vertical we serve. In reality, these pages have very little relevance to what your customers are actually searching for, or what it is that you actually do in that space - limiting the reach and missing out on potential customers who would benefit from your solutions. Are you ready to reimagine your entire industry vertical proposition? Jason will explain the ins and outs of industry pages, their role in content marketing, and - more importantly - how optimizing content around the pain points and direct needs of your customers is more relevant now in B2B marketing than ever before. Jes Scholz (she/her) Group CMO, Ringierjes_scholz | @ringier_ag Mind the Gap: Bridging Generational Differences in SEO To keep up with the ever-evolving needs of users, Google is transforming from being a search engine to an ecosystem of experiences that often reach people before they need to search. Discover, Google Lens, YouTube Shorts, and Bard are just a few examples of this shift towards richer, more engaging surfaces. By the end of this talk, you'll be able to leverage these new visibility platforms to improve organic performance and future-proof your brand.

You'll walk away from this session understanding how Google core updates work, how and why the results change, how to respond to being hit by an update, and how to future-proof your site.Miracle Inameti-Archibong (she/her) Head of Organic Search, John Lewis (Financial Services)@Mira_Inam How to Use Brand SEO to Future-Proof Your Online Visibility With digital ad spending projected to reach $701 billion in 2023, generic CTR dropping by 12% between position 1 and 2, the increase in no-click searches (+60%), and the constant rolling out of updates, it's more important than ever to build a sustainable online brand presence to algorithm-proof your traffic.

Dr. Pete Meyers (he/him) Marketing Scientist, Moz@Dr_Pete | @Moz Lower Your Shields: The Borg Are Here From ChatGPT to Bing's Prometheus to Google's Bard, AI (specifically, Large Language Models) is disrupting search as we know it. We can fight the inevitable, or we can put these tools to work.

Ross Simmonds (he/him) CEO & Founder, Foundation Marketing@TheCoolestCool | @FoundationIncCo The Evolution of Content & The Future of Our Industry Is it all over? Is the world as we knew it a wrap? With the rise of AI - is it realistic to assume that the world of SEO and content will stay the same? Or should we all start dusting off our resumes to try something new? In this presentation, Ross is going to share a blend of both the realities of how AI can be incorporated into our work (maybe to give us additional runway) and answer the question as to whether or not AI is actually coming for our jobs and what we can do to ensure that we're ahead of the curve when it comes to using these tools, embracing the technology and finding edges amidst rapid change. Tom Anthony (he/him) CTO, SearchPilot@TomAnthonySEO | @SearchPilot Entities Are the Past: Search Is Going Multidimensional For years, \"keywords\" were everything in search, and then came the rise of 'the entity'. Tom believes that the time of the entity will soon be over, and will explain how Deep Learning 'latent spaces' are highlighting that entities were 1-dimensional thinking. The future of search is going to be about context, and it isn't far off. You'll walk away from this session with a new technique that will replace keyword research so that you can prepare, and ideally, get ahead of the competition. Tom Capper (he/him) Senior Search Scientist, Moz@thcapper | @Moz The SERP is Dead, Long Live The SERP SEOs have complained for many years now, that the SERP just isn't what it used to be. We yearn for the simpler days of 10 blue links. But Google is changing for a reason, and SEOs have reason to be invested in its survival. Besides, not all SERP features are bad news. In this talk, Tom will look at Google's direction, and the strategic imperatives that are forcing its hand. You'll walk away with a plan to unearth happiness (and organic revenue) in the brave new world.
