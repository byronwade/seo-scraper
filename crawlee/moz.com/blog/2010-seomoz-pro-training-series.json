By: Jennifer Sable Lopez June 30, 2010 You're Invited! 2010 SEOmoz PRO Training Series SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Yabba Dabba Doooo! Ok, I have no idea what the Flintstones has to do with SEO training, but the point is... I'm excited. It's that time of year again when we open up registration for the PRO Training Series: Tips, Tricks and Tactics. See! Now do you get why I'm so giddy? As with every year, we have a killer lineup of speakers including Tim Ash, Dan Zarella, Laura Lippay, Wil Reynolds, Marshall Simmonds, Will Critchlow. Plus we've brought back the highly acclaimed \"Ice Cream Break\" - you wouldn't want to miss that. Rand and Dharmesh Shah having an ice cream treat. Here's the deal, last year we sold out quickly and, sadly, had to actually turn away a lot of requests. With a limit of only 310 attendees, the networking alone is going to be amazing. But that also means tickets will go quickly. The sooner you register, the better your chances of learning from top-notch speakers and networking with a unique group of advanced SEOs (Oh... and you get to hang out with JLo. heh.) So, let's just jump right into the details... or you can just go register. :D Details! Where: Westin Hotel, Seattle (This is where we had it last year as well, and it rocked!) When: August 30 - 31, Plus an optional ½ day tools training on September 1 (65 person limit) Price: $1149 for general attendees $649 for PRO Members (that's $500 off the regular price!) Plus $125 for the optional tools training Speakers! Remember that killer lineup I mentioned above, well here's the full list. As you can see the speakers cover a huge spectrum of knowledge an expertise. Plus don't forget, the tickets are limited, so it's a lot easier to get one-on-one time with them in this setting. Rand Fishkin, SEOmoz David Mihm, GetListed.org Dan Zarrella, Hubspot Will Critchlow, Distilled Jen Sable Lopez, SEOmoz Laura Lippay, NinebyBlue Ben Hendrickson, SEOmoz Lindsay Wassell, Keyphraseology and SEOmoz Ian Lurie, Portent Interactive Wil Reynolds, SEER Interactive Rob Ousbey, Distilled Joanna Lord, SEOmoz Marshall Simmonds, Define Search Strategies Tom Critchlow, Distilled Tim Ash, Sitetuners The Goods!

If you don't believe me about the amazing networking that happens at the seminar, read How to Network at an SEOmoz Seminar After-Party from audiore. She wrote this after the seminar last year, and it's a great guide to networking. Plus, where else can you geek out at the computer at a party? (see below) A group geeking out at the after party DVDs If you can't attend the seminar, or even if you do and just want to relive it forever, you'll be able to purchase the training on DVD. We'll have more information about that coming soon. :) London Seminar - October 25-26 Don't worry!
