G By: GeoffreyF67 October 16, 2007 To Sphinn or Not to Sphinn - That is the Question! Social Media This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. A while back I removed all of the social media bookmark links from my blog. At the time, my reasoning was that it was simply cluttering up the page and really added no value. It also looked rather silly to have 15 icons at the bottom of each post so that someone might bookmark it. I'd actually add it back in if: A) I thought there were some value in doing so. B) Readers didn't find it a nuisance. C) It didn't slow the page load time down any. Comments? Along the same lines of thinking, I was considering just adding Sphinn to my blog because many of the topics I write about are SEO-related in some form or fashion and Sphinn seems to target that market. However, having said that, I've yet to see any reviews of Sphinn and whether it drives any decent traffic or not. Do the visitors stick around? What are their demographics? Anyone have any comments on this? G-Man P.S. My blog recently got a facelift. Check it out and let me know what you think. Don't worry - I've got my flame retardant suit on! :) P.P.S. My health is improving, although I'm still in the hospital and working on being able to walk again. Cancer is finally in remission too :) Copied! Back to Top",
