By: Rand Fishkin March 22, 2006 Welcome to G-Man, SEOmoz's Newest Blogger Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I'm thrilled to welcome Geoffrey, aka G-Man as the latest blogger addition to the SEOmoz team. G-Man has a strong technical background and is familiar with both the white and black hat sides of SEO. I'm looking forward to his unique perspective giving SEOmoz's readers, myself included, a broader feel for the issues at the search engines, and those that have nothing to do with them. I've asked Geoff to be as open and off-topic as he wants, so look for postings that are sure to stir interest, create controversy and educate all of us white hats in our bubble of search engine guidelines. Congrats to you Geoff! What are your plans with 2000 odd daily readers? Copied! Back to Top",
