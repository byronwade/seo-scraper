By: Rand Fishkin April 19, 2006 Where are all the Great Designers? Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Many, many folks who contact us are seeking re-development of their website. When Matt doesn't have the time to put together one of his gorgeous designs for them, it's been very tough for me to point people in the right direction to hire a talented designer who can use CSS effectively and create a standards-compliant site (I don't recommend it as much for the principle as for the gobs of links & visitors that CSS sites will point your way, as I've mentioned in the past). However, I think I've finally found the watering hole of many of the up-and-coming CSS gurus. At Stylegala's forum you can explore thousands of designs and designers, all posting their ideas to get feedback and exposure. Take particular note of the Site Showcase, where topics often display the designers' work directly. I particularly liked: This exploration of design issues on Seimone.com A request for review of CSSRemix, which I'm guessing has the added benefit of getting the right audience to the site (people who'll probably bookmark it, too) Critiquing of Iconlive.com (great looking site) If I were hiring a designer (and hopefully, that's in the not-too-distant future), this is where I'd start.
