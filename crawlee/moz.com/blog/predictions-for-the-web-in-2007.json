By: Rand Fishkin December 18, 2006 Predictions for the Web in 2007 Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. It's nearing the end of the year, so why not give a shot at playing fortune teller - here are some predictions for what will be up (and down) next year: A great number of old-media sites will integrate social, \"Web 2.0\" features into their online properties. We'll see a few copies of Digg, a few MySpace-like clones, a couple del.icio.us' and plenty of maps mash-ups Google's market share will rise in search and Ask's will, too (only slightly). Yahoo! and MSN will stay flat or slightly decline (allthough Yahoo!'s a pretty darn good engine at this point). Yahoo! will continue to have success with content projects; their news, finance, sports, entertainment and new projects in Food, TV and Answers will bring them a greater share of the web audience as a whole. MySpace will start an inexorable decline, possibly late in the year, into the forgotten world of Xanga & Friendster. That's the problem with relying on 12-22 year olds for the majority of your page views; they have a short attention span. LinkedIn is going to continue to have success, as will Last.fm, Zillow, Flickr & YouTube - those Web 2.0 properties that have a unique niche and audience are going to thrive while a lot of minor entrants play second fiddle. Wikipedia's credibility is going to suffer; as a source of truthiness, it's great, but the pranksters, spammers and agenda-based edits will eventually make enough of a dent that on any given article, the chances of accuract will be low enough (80-90%) to make it unacceptable as a research tool. In the SEO world, the practice of viral media generation and marketing (aka the good kind of linkbait) will continue to spread in the world of high-profile SEO firms, but remain very rare among smaller, local firms. Cloaking (the good kind) will grow as more and more websites using AJAX, personalization and geo-targeting find that they can't serve Google the same content they deliver their visitors. Comment spam is going to remain at its current levels - most of the people who will adopt nofollow (ever) already have and the remainder are still providing enough value to blog spammers to make it worthwhile to continue operations. Windows Vista won't fix email spam... In fact, it will still be a problem in 2010. Yahoo! and MSN will get their own versions of Webmaster Central/Sitemaps. This will be a very, very good decision. Social media marketing is going to rise in prominence and value as a link building tactic. Blogging will start to slide in popularity, though possibly not until 2008 or 2009. People won't stop reading them entirely, but other publishing platform styles will take a chunk of the audience and the writers. Microsoft won't acquire Yahoo! (I'm not saying it's not a good move, I'm just saying it won't happen). Buying links is going to remain an effective way for websites to rank for low and mid-level competition phrases. Disagree?
