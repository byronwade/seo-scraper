O By: Oatmeal May 25, 2007 How to Market a Website with $100 Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Patrick Sexton (aka feedthebot) over at SEOish contacted a few big names in the search marketing industry and asked: What would you do if you only had 100 dollars to market your website? This excellent post includes responses from Aaron Wall, Andy Beal, Andy Hagans, Kid Disco, Lee Odden, Todd Malicoat, Neil Patel, and Patrick himself. This is a great read for someone who is just getting started with online marketing and is on a very small budget, such as a college student or a single parent. The responses varied in their degree of specificity. Some recommended simply building quality content and attracting links that way, others recommended buying Aaron Wall's SEO Book. There was also plenty of mention of how to leverage social media and using blogging to become an authority in your sector. For the veteran SEO, this post is an excellent resource to send clients who perhaps can't afford your services or are looking to set out on their own in the search marketing world. Copied!
