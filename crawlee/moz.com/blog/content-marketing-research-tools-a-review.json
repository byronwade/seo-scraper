By: Jeremy Durant February 26, 2014 Content Marketing Research Tools: A Review SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. As content marketing becomes the “norm” for many professionals, free and paid tools to create original content grows with it. Today, it seems every webinar, blog post, forum and tweet I read is recommending a new keyword research database… and I proceed to panic with the feeling that I should utilize every single one in order to create the most unique and engaging content. Reality is, spending days on multiple platforms will keep you from the core function of what these tools are here for: writing. Below is a list of popular keyword research tools (free or paid, new or old) using the same keyword search (“B2B content marketing”): Google Keyword Planner (free with AdWords account) Functionality: For a complete newbie to Google AdWords (me), I’ll be honest that its functionality for keyword research is low. This is because AdWords’ primary purpose is not for grabbing keywords – it’s there for creating Google advertisements. So hunting down the keyword planner section can take a moment. Diversity of results: Results are pretty straightforward, but nothing new for the industry. Many of the search results could help to build beginner articles, how-to’s and general tips. Rand made a good point in this post that relying on AdWords findings is not always the most effective strategy when creating high ranking content. Useful add ons: Aside from creating ads, AdWords offers nothing additional to support content marketing. Google Trends (free) Functionality: Much simpler than AdWords, Google Trends works just like any typical Google search making it easy to get started. Diversity of results: Well, according to Google Trends “B2B content marketing” in the past 30 days hasn’t generated enough search volume to graph any data (I think other databases would disagree). Backing out to 90 days or more you’ll start to see results based on “search interest” (note: not the same as search volume). If the graph populates with enough data, it will show “high interest” news and articles related to that topic over time*. Useful add-ons: The Image and YouTube Search in Google Trends has potential. Unfortunately for industry specific topics it’s difficult to pull enough data for anything to populate. In the meantime, I’ll just watch the Hot Trends screen for hours on end. *I had to use a broader keyword (“content marketing”) to get this to happen. Google Trends says on January 9, 2014 this Fox Small Business article ranked highest in search interest, but cross-checking with other research tool pulls a variety of other valuable articles. Alltop (free) Functionality: While a little overwhelming, results are simplified when using the search bar. After selecting a related keyword, you can browse articles from high-ranking blogs and the “Most Topular” Stories. Diversity of results: While not as focused on specific words, Alltop provides a wide range of articles once a related keyword is selected. Only downside is the quality of results is based on the related keyword. For example, “SEO” received legitimate article examples, while “blogging” (below) featured some valuable articles (like this one from CopyBlogger) mashed with unrelated content (like this piece on Newport Restaurant Week). Useful add-ons: With a MyAlltop account users can create a “personal, online magazine rack” to share with others. But in the words of Sweet Brown, ain’t nobody got time for that. Übersuggest (free) Functionality: After getting through the CAPTCHA and skimming the simple directions to decipher the data, Übersuggest provides you with no-fuss real-time user query results. Diversity of results: Übersuggest lives up to its name and provided a 170-keyword list. While it doesn’t provide rank score, competition or example blog posts, a savvy marketer can determine which keywords in the list provide the best value. Useful add-ons: A simple “shopping cart” feature will populate your top choices in a pop-up window for copy and pasting purposes. Helpful if you’re doing searches for multiple clients or campaigns and don’t have time to evaluate all the outcomes. Moz Keyword Difficulty and SERP Analysis (paid) Functionality: As long as the other tools in the left menu bar don’t distract you (which is hard not to —I’m addicted to Followerwonk), you simply type the keyword and wait for the data to generate. Diversity of results: It’s hard to rank this Moz tool for real-time keyword research since you cannot provide a time frame—you’re only searching for the keyword as a whole. Regardless, this SEO tool can still help with guest blogging opportunities or just general knowledge of the keyword and website authorities. Useful add-ons: While not within Keyword Difficulty, with the paid Moz membership you can utilize Followerwonk and Open Site Explorer to supplement keyword research. Topsy (free and paid) Functionality: Topsy addresses a multitude of research needs by searching content across links, tweet, photos, video and influencers—all within a simple search bar. Simple and straightforward, Topsy ensures you’re not wasting time just figuring out if the right information is pulling. Diversity of results: Based on the top five results for the week, Topsy is telling me that tip lists and step-by-step articles are high ranking in the realm of B2B content marketing—reinforcing that posts starting with a number are never a bad route. Useful add-ons: As stated above, Topsy incorporates Twitter, images, videos and influencers in their search results. The image search is especially helpful to find infographic inspiration. Buzzsumo (free and paid version coming soon) Functionality: Taking a lesson from Topsy and Google Trends—just type in your keyword and Go! You can also add exclusionary keywords or search multiple keywords at once within “advanced options.” Diversity of results: For a site that is in Beta testing, Buzzsumo already pulls data to similar database Topsy, which at least reassures me of its accuracy. This is slowly becoming my favorite tool because of its relevant and reliable add-ons. Useful add-ons: Filtering options and the ability to view quickly total shares across Google+, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter is incredibly helpful. Similar to Topsy, Buzzsumo has an influencer search. What makes it better is Buzzsumo's list shows each profile's Moz page authority, a transparent method that instills a bit more trust in the search results. Bonus Tool: Real Human Beings Despite all the digital tools out there, I’m still inspired most by the coworkers and professionals around me. Hosting regular brainstorming sessions to ask people what they see as upcoming trends not only lightens the load on your personal content research, but also creates internal buy-in. Ultimately, the best platform is the one that provides you the highest quality results without wasting hours of searching to support the data yourself. One could argue that there are more databases out there—if we left out any you believe are superior to the ones listed above be sure to share in the comments below.Editor's note: this post was written by Caroline Gilbert.
