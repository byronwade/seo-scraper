G By: GeoffreyF67 April 21, 2006 Is Cloaking a Valid Method for Reducing Bandwidth? Blogging The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. When cloaking is mentioned, most people start to shiver and shudder. They point to all the nifty doorway pages, Google's TOS and say how horrible and evil it is.But is cloaking really that evil?Take, for instance, a high trafficed site that gets a million hits a day. Serving no ads to the bots as well as other streamlined code could result in significant savings!You could even use cloaking as a method of getting some of your text that you want indexed higher in the page (some believe (not me mind you) that this will help your rankings). That's not so evil is it? The content really isn't changing - unless you consider the ads to be part of the content. And most of the time the ads are in javascript so why serve up the javascript just so the search engines have to spend more time downloading and processing it?G-Man Copied! Back to Top",
