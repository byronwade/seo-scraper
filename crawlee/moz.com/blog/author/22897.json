Hey, These Aren’t My Competitors! 6/30/2022 There are many reasons why the results from a tool like True Competitor might not match your expectations, and that could be a good thing.

Title Tag Rewrites: 7 Months Later 3/28/2022 Back in August, we analyzed 10,000 SERPs and found that Google was rewriting 58% of the title tags we were able to track. In September, after some serious objections from the SEO community, Google made changes so that “title elements are now used around 87% of the time”. This immediately raises two questions. First, has the situation improved? Second, why the huge mismatch between our numbers? Let’s take a look.
