By: Rand Fishkin June 1, 2008 Q+A Through the Blog: Round 2 Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I was browsing my friend Jeremy's site last week and saw that he had already reached Round 8 in his Q+A series. I've done it once before here at SEOmoz - Questions Here and Answers Here and Here (there were a lot of questions) - but it's been 7 months, so I think we're due for another round. Besides, last year's thread resulted in my favorite comment and reply of all time. The way this works is simple - just ask any question you'd like in the comments below on topics including: SEOmoz's History The SEOmoz Website or Business Model Our Venture Capital Investment & Future Plans My Personal Life or Opinions Other Mozzers SEO Industry/Politics Search/Online Marketing Tactics & Strategies We'll collect questions from now until Wednesday or Thursday of this week, then publish answers by next Monday (if not before). Be aware that I may not be able to answer all questions fully, but I'll do my best to address as many as possible in as much detail as I can. p.s. If there's a question below that you're particularly interested in seeing answered, give it a thumbs up. I'll try to prioritize answers and depth of response based on the thumbs. Copied!
