Table of Contents Copied! By: Danny Dover August 3, 2009 Search Engine Optimization Secrets Book: I Want Your Input Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Disclaimer: This post doesn’t include SEO advice or tactics. Instead it is a request for input on a book I am writing. If you are looking for actionable SEO content, please skip this post and read the other search related posts on our blog. About three months ago, I was fortunate enough to be contacted by Wiley Publishing and asked to write a book about SEO. (I am pretty sure they are confusing me with Danny Sullivan but I don't plan on telling them until after the book is published ;-p) I am quite honored by the whole experience and want to make sure I use the opportunity to the fullest. This is where all of you come in :D. Below you will find my preliminary table of contents. Most of you are my target audience, and I would love to hear what you want to read. More Information Available On Amazon: United States United Kingdom Search Engine Optimization Secrets At Google, search engineers talk about 80-20 problems. They are describing situations where the last 20% of the problem is 80% of the work. Learning SEO is one of these problems. 80% of the knowledge SEOs need to know is available online for free. Unfortunately, the remaining 20% takes the majority of the time and energy to find and understand. My goal with this book is to solve this problem by making the last 20% as easy to get as the first 80%. While I don't think I will be able to cover the entire 20% (some of it comes from years of practice and as far as I know there is no secret shortcuts) I am going to include as much actionable advanced material as humanly possible. My current projection is 450 pages. Below I have my table of contents for your consideration. Please feel free to leave suggestions and thoughts in the comments or e-mail me at danny (at symbol) seomoz.org Search Engine Optimization Secrets: Table of Contents Part 1: Understanding Search Engine Optimization The Truth About SEO Popularity Relevancy Part 2: Understanding How SEO Professionals See The Web 10 Foot View (Individual Content Pieces) 100 Foot View (Web Page) 1,000 Foot View (Website) 10,000 Foot View (Web Network) Part 3: Picking The Right SEO Tools View Source Search Engines as SEO Tools Search Engine Provided Tools On-Page SEO Tools Linkscape SEO Toolbars Unix Terminal Part 4: Learning How SEO Professionals Find SEO Problems 5 Minute SEO Audit 5 Minute Brand Reputation Audit Identifying Search Engine Penalties Performing Competitive Analysis Note: Longer audit processes are included later in the book Part 5: Learning How SEO Professionals Solve SEO Problems I am keeping this a secret for now ;-p (That Danny guy is a jerk...) Part 6: Making Money with SEO Consulting (Still a work in progress, I want the content to be more about how to make money and less about the consulting process. Which direction do you think I should go?) The Consultant Advantage Identifying SEO Goals Identifying Priorities How to Explain Advanced SEO Concepts to Clients Working With Large Scale Websites Part 7: Getting to Know The Greatest People in The World (SEO Industry) Brief History Understanding The People Behind The Industry The Importance of Knowing Who is Who Part 8: Resources That Are Worth More Than The Price of This Book I am keeping this one a secret for now too ;-p To make up for the sensationalist title, I will spill the beans a little bit and say that one of the chapters will be a compete and annotated SEO audit just like the ones I do for major clients at SEOmoz. (Note: All of this is subject to change and hopefully improvement) P.S. Rand, Eric Enge, Stephan Spencer and Jessie Stricchiola also have a book coming out. I have not read it but I bet it is going to be great. You can get more details at The Art of SEO. P.P.S I always feel awkward trying to sell myself or my work. I apologize if this post rubs you the wrong way. If it does, feel free to either mail your complaints to me at SEOmoz on the back of a $10 bill or send them via e-mail to sam (at) seomoz.org (totally kidding... but feel free to spam Sam). Copied!
