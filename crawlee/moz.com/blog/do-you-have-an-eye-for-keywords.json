By: Matt Redford April 27, 2010 Do you have an Eye for Keywords? SEO Tools This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I've been working hard over the last few months on a new keyword tool. Another keyword tool?! I'm afraid so :) I've called it Keyword Eye (this explains the lame title on my post). Whilst not providing any additional data that the Google search based keyword tool gives us already, I've interpreted and visualised the data in a different way. The tool can accept two inputs: Keyword - this will return keyword ideas based on the entered keyword URL - this will return keyword ideas based on the content within the URL specified Now onto the important bit - results! The screen shot below shows a sample of results based on the keyword 'new homes'. I'll summarise the results: Keyword size reflects search volume Keyword colour reflects competition. Red is high, amber is medium and green is low Additional information can be found when hovering your mouse over the keyword I've recently added a settings section which allows you to edit and filter the results. This enables you to: Choose the keyword match type from broad, phrase or exact Choose the country which the results should be tailored to Choose how the results should be ordered, for example 'search volume descending' Choose the number of results (depending on the popularity of your keyword) Filter out keywords with a certain competition level Filter out keywords higher or low than a specified search volume Filter out keywords including specified keywords Keyword lists can be built and exported if needed. Whilst I don't think the tool is perfect (I'd love to get feedback from everyone) I think it's a good variation of an existing keyword tool and certainly makes a change from reading rows and rows of keyword data in a usual manner. Primarily I think it would be good for keyword brainstorming prior to a PPC or SEO campaign, including in presentations, aiding affiliates finding a niche market and blogging to name a few.
