By: Erica McGillivray May 7, 2015 ​We Want Your Stories: Accepting MozCon Ignite Pitches SEO Events | Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. We're thrilled to announce the addition of a networking and Ignite-style event for attendees on Tuesday night at MozCon. For years, you've asked us for more networking and relaxing times, and this is what we've dreamed up. But we need your help! We want you to share your stories, passions, and experiences. There are 16—yes, 16—speaking slots. Ignite-style talks are 5 minutes in length and slides auto-advance. That's right, there's no going back, and once it's done, it's done! Learn more about the format and why you should do it. In order to encourage relaxation, none of these talks will be about online marketing. Instead, we want to use this opportunity to get to know our fellow community members better. We want to hear about your passion projects, interests, and the things that fascinate you outside marketing. Tell us about how you spend weekends making support banners for your favorite soccer team or why you mentor high school students, for example. The basic details To submit, just fill out the form below. Please only submit one talk! We want the one you're most excited about. Talks cannot be about online marketing. They are only 5 minutes in length, so plan accordingly. If you are already speaking on the MozCon stage, you cannot pitch for this event. Submissions close on Sunday, May 17 at 5pm PDT. Selection decisions are final and will be made in late May / early June. All presentations must adhere to the MozCon Code of Conduct. You must attend MozCon, July 13-15, and the Tuesday night event in person, in Seattle. If selected, you will get the following 5 minutes on the Tuesday night stage to share with our audience. The event lasts from 7-10pm and will be at Benaroya Hall (where the Seattle Symphony plays). $300 off a regular priced ticket to MozCon. (If you already purchased yours, we'll issue a $300 refund for regular priced ticket or $100 for an early bird ticket. Discount not available for super early bird special.) We will work with you to hone your talk! Loading... As we want to ensure every single speaker feels both comfortable and gives their best talk possible, myself and Matt Roney are here to help you. We'll review your topic, settle on the title, walk through your presentation with you, and give you a tour of the stage earlier in the evening. While you do the great work, we're here to help in anyway possible. Unfortunately, we cannot provide travel coverage for these MozCon Ignite speaking slots. What makes a great pitch Focus on the five minute length. Be passionate about what you're speaking about. Tell us what's great about it. For extra credit, include links to videos of you doing public speaking. Follow the guidelines. Yes, the word counts are limited on purpose. Do not submit links to Google Docs, etc. for more information. Tricky and multiple submissions will be disqualified. We're all super-excited about these talks, and we can't wait to hear what you might talk about. Whether you want to tell us about how Frenchies are really English dogs or which coffee shop is the best in Seattle, this is going to be blast! The amazing Geraldine DeRuiter, known for her travel blogging and witty ways, will be emceeing this event. If you're still needing inspiration or a little confused about an Ignite talk, watch Geraldine's talk from a few years ago about sharing personal news online: Like our other speaker selections, we have a small committee at Moz running through these topics to get the best variety and fun possible. While we cannot vet your topic, feel free to ask questions in the comments. Everyone who submits an Ignite pitch will be informed either way. Best of luck! Haven't bought your MozCon ticket?
