By: Danny Dover September 9, 2010 Discussing LDA and SEO Whiteboard Friday The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. In this week's Whiteboard Friday Rand Fishkin and Ben Hendrickson discuss LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). There has been a lot of discussion about the relationship between these two topics lately and this video answers many of the questions people in the community have been asking. It is comprehensive (25 minutes) and uses many easy to understand diagrams and examples to discuss what impact LDA may have on the SEO industry. We look forward to reading your comments below. Video Transcription Rand: Howdy, SEOmoz fans. Welcome to another edition of Whiteboard Friday. Today, I am joined by Ben Hendrickson. Ben? Ben: Hello. We've met before. Rand: Have we really? Ben: I think so. Rand: So, Ben is our senior scientist here at SEOmoz. He does a lot of our research work and has been working on some interesting projects. Lately, we posted about one of those projects and asked for some feedback and got some great responses. A lot of people are very passionate, very excited. And some people are a little confused. So, we wanted to dive deeper with this LDA stuff. What's LDA, Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We wanted to talk about topic modeling in general. There was some feedback, right, and I am sure you saw some of it too, that was like, \"I'm not quite sure. You're saying on-page maybe is more important because of this LDA stuff, and I always thought on-page just meant keyword density or stuffing your keywords.\" Ben: Yeah. Clearly words used matter. For any given SERP, a huge number of links aren't going to rank for it because they have nothing to do about it because they never use the word at all. Right? I mean, Google.com ranks a very few things and it has a ton of links. So, of course, words matter that are on the page. Rand: But we've always, as an SEO, even when you've done your previous research, it was sort of like, boy, it sure does look like links are a whole lot more important than . . . Ben: Using the keyword in the title box. Right. Yeah. So this was something that actually was very surprising for us, which is why we showed it. What was that? It seems like using other sort of related words to the query in a very specific way seemed to help a lot. Right? Rand: And we were kind of weirded out by that. Ben: Yeah. Rand: Or we were at least surprised by that. So, that is why we are sharing it. So, let's go back in time a little bit and talk about this whole . . . for people who are kind of going, \"I don't understand what you mean when you say it's more sophisticated than keyword density, or it's more sophisticated than a normal keyword metric or keyword usage.\" Keyword density is just like the percent of times that the word is used out off all the words in a document. Ben: Yeah. Rand: Super simple to game. Kind of useless for IR is my understanding. Ben: Well, I mean, it gets you a lot of the way. I mean, at least you have that word in the document you return to people. But, like your blog post earlier in the week showed, there is a lot of basic situations where you can't tell what is the better content just by doing this. Rand: Right. And so, IR folks in the '60s came up with this TF-IDF thing, which is essentially like looking at whether the terms that are being used are more frequent in the corpus as a whole. So, if you are like a library, they look at all the books in the library. Or if you are a card catalogue, they'll look at all that. And now that there are search engines, they look at all of the documents on the Web. Ben: Yeah, right. So, the big intuition here is that they are searching for multiple words. The word that is rarely ever used is the one that actually matters the most. So, if you are searching for the SEOmoz building, a document that includes a building and SEOmoz is probably very relevant. A document that contains \"the building\" or \"the SEOmoz\" is a lot less relevant. So, the basic story there is that you are biased against caring about words that are very common. Rand: Right. So I like your Lady Gaga example where you're like, well, documents that have Gaga on them are probably way more relevant than those that just have lady on them, even though lady and Gaga are both four letter words in the phrase. Ben: Yeah, exactly. Rand: All right, cool. So we evolved to this TF-IDF stuff. And then there is this like co-occurrence thing, which we talked about on the SEOmoz blog a long time ago. Co-occurrence is kind of interesting where we look at, and let me make sure I am getting this right. It is essentially that, oh well, oftentimes when I see, for example, Distilled Consulting and building and SEOmoz and building, I find those frequently together because it turns out that we share offices with Distilled and we do lots of work together and those kinds of things. So, maybe a document that has both Distilled and building and SEOmoz might be more relevant than just the one that just says SEOmoz. Ben: Exactly. Right. So, if you are trying to basically figure out if it's just an offhand reference to it or if it's something that is actually valid a whole lot, right, the fact that it is using a whole lot of other words that also occur with the keyword would be a good indication of that. Rand: But then topic modeling, I think that even I get a little bit confused when I think about topic modeling versus co-occurrence, because it seems like topic modeling is maybe very similar to this. Ben: Well, this is great because you drew a Venn diagram that shows the difference really well. Rand: Right. Super smart of me. Ben: It's like you kind of knew. So you can imagine that you could have a whole bunch of words that would have a very high co-occurrence with Star Trek. Right? You could have documents that talk about gravity, space, planet, and tachyon. But it still might not be about Star Trek, even though you've got four words that co-occur a lot with Star Trek. It could about astronomy. Those are all real things that exist in the real world, or at least people think they might exist in the real world in the context of tachyons. But if you have something that is talking about tachyons and gravity and William Shatner, that's probably Star Trek. Right? And so, it's not just the number of words you have that co-occur. You are actually trying to figure out are these words being used in the context where they are talking about Star Trek, or are these words being used in the context of talking about astronomy. The way we can do this is because in general fewer topics is better. So, it's possible that we have something that is talking about astronomy and TV and it happened to use gravity and tachyon and William Shatner in the context of something else he did. But it's more likely to just have . . . Rand: So normally, we might say like, \"Okay, I can imagine Google using this to try and do a couple of things.\" Right? Ben: Right. Rand: For weird queries, where maybe the word Star Trek wasn't used but they think it might be about that and they think that's what the person wanted, maybe they would do it. But for ordinary rankings, it seems like using these words when I'm talking about astronomy or using these words when I'm talking about Star Trek isn't going to help me any more than not using them. But then we did this topic modeling work and we tried to analyze that. Right? So we used a process called LDA, which maybe we can talk about in a sec. But we used this process to basically build a model that has all these different topics. Ben: Right. Rand: And essentially, the topics, as I understand them, aren't actually keywords. They're just like a mathematical representation of a subject matter. Like you were saying there's probably a cartoon topic, but it's not like the word occurred necessarily. Ben: Yeah, right. So, it has actual words in it. Right? Rand: Yeah. Ben: You can look at a given topic and you can see all of the words in it and see how much each word is in it. But no human went by and said we should make a topic about this to show what words may be put together. So, if you look at papers, people pretty much refer to topics by whatever the most common word in it is, which in the case of cartoon might be cartoon. Rand: Like I remember one of the early ones we were looking at was Transformers. Ben: Yeah, right. Rand: It was like, oh, well, Optimus Prime and Megatron and Sydney, the woman who's in the all of the movies now. She came up a lot. Megan Fox was in there. Ben: Is she related to Vanessa Fox. Rand: I don't think so. Ben: Okay. Rand: In fact, I strongly suspect no. Ben: Okay. Rand: I'd guess it's a screen name. But so, in any case, you get these topics. You have these words in them. And then when we say, \"Well, how much does this matter? Like how much does it matter if I am writing a page about Star Trek and I have lots of links pointing to me, but I'm not ranking as well as I think I should. Could it be that maybe I have not included keywords that would tell Google that I am actually about the topic Star Trek or about related topics?\" Yes. And so, we don't know how important that is. And that's why we did something about correlation to try and figure this out. Ben: Yeah, right. Because, obviously, we don't work at Google. Rand: We just have to look at the outcome. Ben: We have to look at the search results and then decide if this seems like what they are doing. Yeah. So we try to see. Rand: All right. So, let's talk about that correlation process. So Ben, we're talking about this correlation thing and a part of me is kind of going like, as a classic SEO, like non-statistics, math major, this kind of thing, I kind of go, \"Isn't the best way to test whether this works is to have like two random documents on the Web, and I'll try putting your LDA stuff to work and see if it raises up one of them or doesn't raise up the other?\" And I can do tests that way. Like, what's this correlation? Why do I need that? Is that a better way to do it? Ben: I mean, they are just different. We've tried doing control tests where we put the keyword and title tag on one and not the other and we see which one ranks. But it's very hard to do enough of those to reach statistical significance. It's pretty easy to set ten websites where one is doing stuff one way and the other is doing stuff the other way. But you end up doing like four one way and six the other, or three one way and seven the other. Frequently, a lot of these effects aren't that big. Google sees it as hundreds of things that influence SERPs. So even if you try to control for as many variables as you can to try and make it the same between these two, there is just a lot of noise in terms of what actually ranks higher. So it takes a very large amount of work to make enough samples to say something with statistical confidence. Rand: And you never know when you might have some weird factor that is influencing all of them in some weird way. Ben: Yeah. There is another problem that you are probably looking at this really tiny page and little tiny domains because you are not setting a huge number of large-scale domains to try to this out. Right? Rand: Right. Ben: So you are going to get an answer. The question is: Is this answer going to scale up to real pages people care about from my small pages that have ten links to them? So, it is a very interesting process, and I actually would be very fascinated that people get good results from it. But, we have tried it and the results have all kind of been . . . Rand: Middling at best. Ben: Middling, yeah. Rand: There are no good conclusions from anything. So instead, we use this correlation process. Right? Ben: Right. Rand: If I understand your process right, you basically run across not a dozen or a hundred, but hundreds or thousands, in some cases, of different search results looking for elements that will predict that something ranks higher or lower. Ben: Yeah. Rand: And so I saw that Danny Sullivan left some great comments in our blog post about LDA. He said, for example, \"Well, you guys said that correlation with keywords in the title is very low. I don't believe that at all because, when I look at search results, all the search results I see almost always have the keyword in the title tag. So, what are you measuring here that I'm not seeing?\" Ben: Right. The difference is measuring what a keyword is in the search results versus measuring what is correlated with making it appear higher in the search results. Rand: So if all of these included the keyword Star Trek in the title element, then what's the ranking correlation of the title element with the keyword? Ben: It would be zero. Right? Rand: Because they are all the same. What's the possibility that something will be a blue link appearing on Google? Ben: That's an interesting thing. We computed some data a while ago using the correlations where we were comparing Bing and Google. It actually was interesting to see Google tends to have a lot of stuff with this element. Bing had fewer things with that element. It actually tells you how the search engine is different. It's interesting just looking at raw prominence when you are trying to compare two search engines. But it's not very interesting when you are trying to compare two features because . . . Rand: Or when you're trying to figure out what will help you rank well. Ben: Exactly. Rand: Okay. So, got you. So what Danny Sullivan is talking about with this \"I see the keyword in the title tag like 70 percent of the time or more,\" that's this raw prominence thing. Ben: Right. Rand: That's like how many times does it appear in there? But correlation of a specific feature with ranking higher is essentially looking at all of these and then saying like, hmm, you know, on an aggregated basis across hundreds or thousands of search results . . . I think the study you did for the Google/Bing thing was like 11,000 different search results. Right? Ben: It took a long time making search, writing it down on paper. Rand: Yeah. I bet it did. You're totally incredible for having done it manually. So, you look at all of those and then you would say, \"Oh, well this particular element on average like, having the keyword exactly match the domain name, the top level the domain like it does here, boy that sure looks like it is correlated with ranking much higher.\" I think having the keyword in the domain name was one of the highest correlated single features that we saw. Ben: Yeah, right. Rand: And the same thing goes for number of linking word domains, like diversity of different link sources that you got. Like in tons and tons of different websites, I have a link to Amazon, that seems to predict or correlates well with it doing pretty darn well. Ben: Right. Rand: And if I recall, I think correlations for title tags and keyword- based stuff, with the exception of the domain name, was in the like 0 to 0.1 range. Maybe 0.15, something like that. Ben: Yeah. In fact, some of them were actually a little bit negative. Rand: Why would it be negative? Ben: Because it is quite plausible that if it's in the title, someone put it there because they would like to rank higher than they actually do and (_________) a lot of other things and it's just not a very good page. Rand: So you're saying, because of keyword stuffing SEOs, there could be a negative correlation or other conflicts. Ben: Yeah. Exactly. Rand: So this on-page stuff, pretty small correlation. Right? So then, we looked at things like links. A lot of those were in the 0.2 to 0.3 range, with 1 being a perfect correlation. So there was like a link to your domains. That was pretty decent, like 0.24 or 0.23 or something like that. Things like page authority, which is a metric we calculate, was really quite nicely high. It was like 0.35 almost, 0.34, something like that. Ben: I can't confirm or deny these numbers. I don't remember them off the top of my head. Rand: All right. But there are different ranges. Right? Ben: Yeah. Rand: So, when we looked at linking stuff, it was almost always better than on-page stuff. Ben: Yeah, right. Links seem to be, if you had to develop a Google search algorithm to sort the things and you had to make a choice of Google as you could, just looking at links seemed to get you most of the way in terms of anything that we did. Rand: So then when we saw this LDA thing at 0.32 something, that seems whacky. That seems crazy high for an on-page factor, because we never looked at anything that was about the features of the words or how you use them, with the exception maybe of the keyword in the domain name, that was this high in correlation. So that sort of struck us as being very odd, and this is one of the reasons that we wrote about it and were excited about. But let me just throw this out there. Correlation is not causation. Right? It could be that maybe domain name is really the thing that is being ranked. But maybe it's other features. Right? Correlation doesn't necessarily mean that that is what is causing it. Ben: Right. And almost certainly our LDA model is not causing it, because Google doesn't use our LDA model. They're not asking for numbers. Right? Then almost certainly Google is not going to do LDA like we have done it. They have not used our corpus. We have a model that is correlated with Google's results, and it is certainly not causing Google's results. But the thing is that it is a very high correlation. So, they are doing something that is somehow producing results that are correlated with a LDA model. It is hard to imagine really what that would be, unless it was some sort of topic modeling or something like looking at the words used on the page. Rand: So, there's two things that come out of this. One is that, to my mind, when I see something that high and assuming all the numbers look right, I think some people gave your numbers a hard time, but it looks like at the least the criticism they have received so far has not made us doubt that we have done something wrong. Ben: Yeah. I spend most of the day running code. But it is quite plausible that I did something wrong. I'm sure I have. But the specific complaints people have come up with so far aren't very credible. But, you know, in the future, it will certainly happen someday. Rand: I'm sure we are all excited for that day, Ben. Assuming that these numbers are quite high, doesn't it sort of say like maybe we've been wrong about this on-page stuff not mattering all that much? Maybe we should do more on that front, like more investigation, test out the results, try putting our keywords on the pages in certain ways. Ben: Well, Google always says to spend time writing good content. Right? And that's a little bit hard to apply, but you can interpret that as being right content makes it clear what your topic is by using words that are going to eliminate any topic from being (________) except for the one that you are trying to rank for. So, I don't know if it's that revolutionary. It seems like people have worried a lot about their content in the past and a lot of people say to do so. Rand: But so people in the past, they talked about things like, oh, we should use like the Google Wonder Wheel. And we should use related searches and put those words on our pages. We should use things like synonyms that we get from the service. Well, how is the LDA stuff different? Or is it? Like if I just do these things, am I going to do great over here? Ben: Well, I mean they are not going to be bad. But if you can imagine that when you put a whole bunch of synonyms for tachyon, it's not going to actually help clarify if you're about astronomy or Star Trek. Right? So, you don't actually or that you're trying to discuss bark collars and you want to just clarify that you are talking about dogs as opposed to the stuff that wraps trees. You are not going to want to put a whole bunch of synonyms for collars or barking. Yeah, but that's sort of weird and unnatural. You much more want to put other related words to make it clear that we are talking about some sort of bark preventive system. Rand: So, let's talk really briefly about the tool today. It doesn't do exactly this. Right? Instead, it give us a score. Ben: Yeah. Rand: All right. Let's look that. Ben: Okay. Rand: Now this LDA score, tool might be an overstatement. It's a Labs. You can look and see it. It works. You can put stuff in. But we have a lot of really beautiful tools here at SEOmoz, and this is not one of them. So, it's not the prettiest thing in the world. But it does leverage the topic modeling work, and you use the specific process, LDA, which we think is sort of better than some other ones, but not being as good as the sophisticated stuff Google does. Ben: Almost certainly. Rand: I enter a query up here. Something I want to rank for. I put in some words here, and it will give me a percent telling me how topically relevant it thinks this content here is to the word here. And it will do the same thing like if I enter a URL down here, it will populate this box with the content from that page. Ben: Right. Rand: So this gives me sort of a rough sense of I can play around and see does SEOmoz's LDA tool work. LDA scores seem to predict anything that I can rank better. So, I could look at the top ten results and be like, \"Wow, I'm winning on links. I think I'm doing a good job of keyword usage. But boy, all these other people have much higher LDA scores than I do. Maybe I should try increasing that.\" Is that sort of a suggested application here? Ben: That would seem very reasonable to me. Like it is kind of new. No one has a huge amount of experience with it. So far, it seems like people have said that it chains up a higher score and it has helped them rank, but that's very anecdotal. There's a very plausible reason why you would think that that would work. But, we're kind of on the bleeding edge here. Rand: We're not trying to say that like you definitely enter something in here, you should use this and boost up the rankings of all of your pages. It will work perfectly or anything like that Ben: Yeah, exactly. But it seems very plausible that basically getting a higher score helps you rank higher. And the tool let's you see clearly what this kind of topic modeling is going to be able to figure out. It sort of shows you the kind of connections that Google certainly will be able to make in figuring out that pizza is related to food but donkey is not related to food. So you can sort of explore and see how this stuff works. Rand: Cool. One weird thing that people have noted and the last point is that this fluctuates a lot. Oftentimes, when I run it, it will fluctuate one to five percent change. Like I'll hit go on the same URL, the same content, the same keyword, and it will change one percent to five percent. Sometimes it seems like it can go to maybe seven, eight, or nine percent. A couple of people have reported -- we haven't been able to see them -- rare instances where it is more than ten percent fluctuation. So, explain to me what is going on there. What is the sampling that the tool does? Ben: Right. So there's a very large possible number of ways that you could explain the document with topics. It could be about Star Trek. Or it could be about astronomy and TV shows. There are lots of different ways that you could explain the different word usages in there. So we can't actually just try all of them and weight them by the probability because that would take years to answer anybody. So instead, we sample them based upon their likelihood and then we average that. So, if you wanted to figure out are most people going to vote Democrat or Republican this year, you might sample 100 people and you're going to conclude that 40 percent are going to vote Democratic this year. Rand: But then if you sample a different 100 people . . . Ben: It will be a little bit different. Generally, you can come back and say 70 percent are going to vote Democratic this year. It's in theory possible, but it doesn't happen that frequently. Rand: Got you. So you can essentially use this number. If I was really interested, I would have to get more precise. I could run it a bunch of times, and I would be getting a bunch of different samples and I would average those out Ben: Yeah. In the back end, we're doing it a bunch of times for you and averaging them. So averaging it yourself on the front end as you go isn't terrible. Rand: It's just a big use of our bandwidth. Ben: Oh, yeah. It really helps our numbers of hits to our website. Rand: Oh, yeah. I'm sure that's all correlated with rankings too. Ben: I know like unique visitors. What's that? Rand: All right. Well, Ben, we're excited about this tool. We really appreciate you doing this research work. It's exciting and interesting. I think we'll know more in the future, in the months to come, whether this is really great and applicable for SEO or that it turns out that maybe it's some other things causing this weird correlation. Ben: Absolutely. Rand: Well, thanks very much for obviously building this and joining us. And thanks to all of you for watching Whiteboard Friday. We'll see you again next week. Ben: This was a long one. Rand: Very impressed that you watched it. We do appreciate it. Video transcription by SpeechPad.com [UPDATE by Ben (sept 10th, 12:50pm PST): In the video I stated that \"specific complaints people have come up with so far aren't very credible.\" This was directed at the claims, not the people who raised them, and I wish I has used the word \"accurate\" instead of \"credible.\" My apologizes to anyone who was offended. Credible people can say things I disagree with. Indeed, the back and forth over their concerns about the unweighted mean Spearman's rank correlation coefficient has been a useful context to explain exactly why we consider it a better statistic to use than commonly suggested alternatives. Also, I noticed that Russ Jones did work to reproduce some of our findings. He used a different dataset and different methodology, emphasized good qualifications to keep in mind, and broke out competitive vs non-competitive which we didn't do.] [ERRATA by Ben (sept 16th, 2:00pm PST): The blog post above reports the correlation measurement as 0.32. It should have been 0.17.] Copied! Back to Top",
