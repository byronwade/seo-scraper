Moz Tools We're happy to announce the second Mozscape index for the month of March is now live! Data has been refreshed across all SEOmoz applications - Open Site Explorer, the Mozbar, PRO campaigns, and the Mozscape API. I know you're all thinking - but wait, you just launched an index last week?! This was one of our fastest indexes to finish processing - taking only 11 days! But processing overlapped slightly for this index and our previous March index. However, the good news is that it just means lots of fresh data for you! As you can see from the crawl histogram, a large volume of the data in this index was crawled in the beginning of March and the oldest data dating back to about the first week of February. Here are the metrics for this latest index: 81,359,307,805 (81 billion) URLs 12,256,956,717 (12.2 billion) Subdomains 149,419,721 (149 million) Root Domains 774,927,201,776 (775 billion) Links Followed vs. Nofollowed 2.18% of all links found were nofollowed 54.51% of nofollowed links are internal 45.49% are external Rel Canonical - 15.80% of all pages now employ a rel=canonical tag The average page has 75 links on it 64.04 internal links on average 11.03 external links on average And the following correlations with Google's US search results: Page Authority - 0.35 Domain Authority - 0.19 MozRank - 0.24 Linking Root Domains - 0.30 Total Links - 0.25 External Links - 0.29 We always love to hear your thoughts!
