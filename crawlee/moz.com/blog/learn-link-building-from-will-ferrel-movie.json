By: Ronald Sudarto October 14, 2009 Learn Link Building From a Will Ferrell Movie Link Building This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Has anyone watched the movie called Semi-pro? Where a small basketball league called ABA is on the verge of collapse and has to be merged with the NBA to survive, but the NBA only accepts four team to be merged and thus the trouble begins. Flint Tropic (Will Ferrell Team) must make a great basketball play and also get two thousand fans so they could get merged. I'm not actually a fan of Will Ferrell movies, but there are a lot of things you can learn from this movie. Will Ferrell is the promoter of the team, and I have to admit that he is doing a great job doing it. He realizes that his team is not good enough to have a lot of fans and so he uses other methods to get a lot of fans. He uses an amazing starting line up, eye liner, free corn dogs for the audience if the score reaches a certain point, dare devil by jumping many girls, half court shot for $10.000 and also wrestling with a bear. In the line of link building sometimes we have to build links but the site is not good enough to generate its own link and thus we have to do what Will Farrel do in the movie, we improvise! Starting line up or should I say first impression So if the website content is generally flat and not so interesting for common viewer but the first time you open the site you got an awesome welcoming sign that leaves the viewer remembering your site more than the other site that is competing and has the same boring content as you are. The next time people want to link about the not-so great content they would remember that your site has better impression than the others. Eye liner Will Ferrel use eye liner in one of his match to increase his team look on national TV. Make your site different with the other site no matter how silly that would look. Remember that your site is not good enough to get its own link, then why don't you use other method to get link. Free Corn Dog for audience when the score reach certain point Give a free gift to the audience of your website when your site reach 10.000 viewer a day for example. This would make the viewers help each other and tell other people to come to your site and probably by linking your link in it. Just remember to put the website stats up front so many people can watch it, but in the movie, Will Ferrel wants to cheat the number so the point would not reach that certain point. Dare Deviling with pretty girl in it Never underestimate the power of pretty girl and incredible stunt, combine they would make incredible link building strategy. What do you sell in your website? A dull car? Use the car in a daredevil stunt video with hot chicks behind. What about dull non-flavored candy? No problem, use it as stunt properties with hot chicks as the background. Half court shot for $10.000 Have you considered building a mini game in your site, where every 100 viewer gets the chance to play the mini game to win $10.000. I'm pretty sure that this would make a great link building strategy. But just make sure that viewer know that the game is beatable and you make it practically impossible to win, just like half court shot. Wrestling with the bear In the final act to get 2000 supporters Will Ferrell announces for those who watch spam the news that he would wrestle with a bear in the next match. In link building term this mean sue big company that would make many people talking about it. Just make sure the big company is someone you are close with and know what you're doing and this is all one big drama to get links. The bear in the movie is a tamed bear, but those people in the movie think it is the real deal. Anyway, this is my first post in YOUmoz and hopefully this has been helpful. I would recommend you to watch the movie even though I think its not a great movie, but in the SEO line of work, I think you could learn a lot. This is only what I think of the movie, if you watch it then you might get another insight on it. Be a promoter just like Jackie Moon (Will Ferrel) in the movie... Copied! Back to Top",
