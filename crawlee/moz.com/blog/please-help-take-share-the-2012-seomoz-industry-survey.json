By: Rand Fishkin March 22, 2012 Please Help: Take + Share the 2012 SEOmoz Industry Survey Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Buenos Dias, marketers! Today's an exciting day! We're thrilled to announce the launch of the 2012 SEOmoz Industry Survey. It's been 2 long years since our last survey, which had more than 10,000 respondents from around the world and produced some of the most detailed public information ever assembled about the growing fields of SEO, social media, content, and organic/inbound marketing. This year's survey is projected to take about 20 minutes to complete (I took it twice and the first time took me ~18 minutes), and it's slightly more detailed than 2010's. We know this means a little extra work on your part, but we hope it will be worth it as we make the data available to all. The survey's available now in SurveyMonkey and will run for 5 weeks to collect data (but early participation's greatly appreciated): The following sections contain the 54 total questions (49 if you're not an agency/consultant): Your Work in the Industry Questions for Consultants, Freelancers, and Agencies Learning and Improving Internet Marketing Skills Internet and Inbound Marketing Scope and Process Inbound Marketing Tools and Tactics SEO Tools and Tactics Social Media Tools and Tactics Predictions/Opinions for Internet/Inbound Marketing As an added incentive for the survey, we are offering the following excellent prizes to some lucky participants: One Grand Prize Winner will get a 16GB Wifi iPad 3. Three First Prize Winners will each get a $75 ThinkGeek gift certificate. Ten Second Prize Winners will each get a $25 gift certificate to the SEOmoz Zazzle Store. To see the full sweepstakes terms and rules, check out our sweepstakes rules page. The winners will be announced by June 4th. We'd also like to thank our partners who are helping to encourage marketers around the world to participate in the survey, including Outspoken Media, Search Engine Land, Distilled, Hubspot, Search Engine Journal, Techipedia, AimClear, Blueglass, Marketing Pilgrim and Search Engine Watch. If you're able, a tweet, Google+ share, Facebook share, or blog post of your own would be incredibly appreciated. It's our goal to reach as many professionals as possible and share something truly remarkable from the data. Thanks for your help and participation! ETA 4/27/12: Because we want to gather the best data from a wider sample set, we've extended the Industry Survey deadline until Friday, May 18th. Help your fellow online marketers and take the 2012 Industry Survey today. Copied! Back to Top",
