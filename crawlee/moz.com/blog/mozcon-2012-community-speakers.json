By: Erica McGillivray July 9, 2012 #MozCon 2012 Community Speakers Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. After much excitement and 150 entries for community speakers at MozCon, I'm happy to announce that we've chosen four amazing people to speak at MozCon 2012! Darren Shaw from Whitespark speaking about local optimization Fabio Ricotta from Mestre SEO speaking about SEO for e-commerce Jeff McRitchie from MyBinding speaking about creating professional video on a budget Dana Lookadoo from Yo! Yo! SEO speaking about structure social sharing Thank you so much to everyone who submitted pitches. There were many super fabulous ones, and it was a very hard choice. I highly suggest writing a YouMoz post if you're still interested in sharing with the SEOmoz community. Congratulations again to our speakers. See you all at MozCon! Copied! Back to Top",
