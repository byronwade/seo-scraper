By: Rand Fishkin January 31, 2006 Eric Ward's Content Publicity Service SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. For anyone who's unfamiliar with Eric Ward, he's the web's original link builder, conducting campaigns for folks like Amazon.com back in the early 90's.Since that time, Eric has built relationships and connections with some of the most visible sources of editorial content on the web (described below), making his time exceptionally valuable and giving a high ROI. Eric's currently promoting a Content Publicity Strategic Plan on his homepage. He's running a low pricing special right now at $2500 and I have to say, I've never seen a bargain like this. I think we'll be using that for several clients in the next few months. Note the types of suggestions provided: Topical directories, aka \"Hub\" sites Niche and subject specific search engines Key web site reviewers, like Yahoo Picks of the Week, FORBES Best of the Web. Blogs. There are bloggers out there who will write about your site (and link to it) Private e-Groups Web/e-zines and e-newsletters that announce and review Web sites Site announcement mailing lists. This kind of link building strategy can only be taken advantage of if you've got a terrific piece of content to showcase in your sector. Even Eric can't peddle crap. Copied! Back to Top",
