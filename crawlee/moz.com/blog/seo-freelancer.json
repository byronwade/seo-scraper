By: Lucio Laria Edited By: Chima Mmeje December 13, 2023 How to Reach Your First $10k Month as an SEO Freelancer [Free Templates] SEO Consulting | Branding The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The appeal of independence and substantial financial gains often drives SEO experts to leave traditional jobs for freelancing. Yet, transitioning to a successful SEO freelancer is no small feat. You might encounter hurdles like inconsistent lead generation, securing fair pricing, and maintaining lasting client relationships. These challenges overshadow the benefits, leaving you to grapple with uncertain incomes and contemplating a return to your 9 — 5 job. But here's some reassurance: navigating these obstacles is entirely achievable with the right strategy. In this article, I'll share insights that propelled me to consistent $10K months so you can replicate my process for success. My 12-step process for scaling an SEO freelance business 1. Choose a profitable niche One of the first steps to reaching $10k months as an SEO freelancer is to set the right pricing structure. However, setting rates is the easy part. The real challenge is finding clients who recognize your value and are willing to invest in them. Certain sectors like SaaS, e-commerce, publishers, or high-demand services typically have more substantial SEO budgets than smaller local businesses or solopreneurs. By specializing in a profitable niche, you elevate your perceived value, stand out in a competitive market, and increase your chances of attracting clients willing to pay higher rates. Clients are generally willing to pay a premium for an SEO consultant who brands as a niche specialist rather than an SEO generalist. Focusing on one niche leads to higher conversion rates and a more streamlined client acquisition process. 2. Create a compelling LinkedIn profile LinkedIn is essential for B2B networking, and having a standout profile is crucial to your acquisition strategy. Here are some tips to optimize your LinkedIn profile: Use a customized background image that clearly states your value propositionCreate a professional profile picture that stands out. I used this tool to create mine. Craft a compelling headline. Take advantage of this space to be creative, attract attention, and build trust. Write an authentic “About” summary. Use storytelling to convince readers of the quality of your services.In the \"Featured\" section, add case studies, articles you have written, or any content that positions you as an authority on the problem.Ensure that the “Experience” section demonstrates the results you have achieved in your past roles.Aim to get at least three client recommendations on LinkedIn You can look at my profile if it helps you get inspired. 3. Build a professional website Creating a professional website is a crucial step in establishing your online presence. WordPress is a popular choice for its SEO-friendliness and ease of use. If you're after an even simpler solution, Wix is a great alternative. Start with a one-page website incorporating these elements: A Header showcasing your value proposition and a call to action (CTA).Client logos to display the brands you've worked with.Why Work with You section, outlining the benefits of your services.Service descriptions and methodology to give potential clients a clear idea of what you offer.A contact form for easy client inquiries. Writing the copy yourself is best since no one knows your services better. If you find copywriting challenging, AI tools like ChatGPT can assist. For inspiration, take a look at my freelance SEO website. It's a straightforward WordPress site with a compelling value proposition, which I completed in just a day for the English version. 4. Have a resume ready Creating a detailed resume as an SEO freelancer is about crafting a narrative that showcases your impact and growth in each role. Here are some tips to help you create a resume: Highlight your experience: Demonstrate the impact of your work in each role, showing growth in your job responsibilities. Include specific achievements and how they contributed to business objectives. Education section: In addition to your professional experience, include a concise \"Education\" section. List relevant studies or courses you've completed that contribute to your SEO expertise. This section doesn't need to be extensive but should complement your practical experience. Use active verbs and KPIs: Start bullet points with action verbs, followed by the results achieved through your SEO initiatives. This method effectively illustrates your direct contribution to SEO business goals. Skills to showcase: If you have skills in content writing, technical SEO, or data analytics, make sure you emphasize them. Attention to design: Use design tools like Canva for a visually appealing resume layout, ensuring it captures attention while remaining professional. Regular updates: Keep your resume current with your latest skills and experiences, ensuring it reflects your most recent accomplishments. 5. Optimize your website for SEO As an SEO expert, your website should showcase your skills. Implement an effective SEO strategy on your site to rank for keywords that potential clients use when seeking SEO services. Here's how to do it: Keyword research and targeting: I identified keywords with decent search volume but lower competition. For example, you can target localized keywords like “SEO Freelancer [city]” or industry-specific terms like “[Industry] SEO Freelancer.” Content optimization: I created content optimized for these targeted keywords, including case studies, client testimonials, and detailed explanations of my SEO strategies. Backlink acquisition: I focused on acquiring high-quality backlinks from relevant industry blogs and local business directories to boost my rankings. Continuous monitoring and updating: Regularly update content and monitor keyword rankings to stay competitive in SEO. 6. Get active on social media Platforms like X (Twitter), LinkedIn, and YouTube are invaluable for growing your brand and engaging with your target audience. Focus on the social media platform where your target audience is most active, as clients often pay more for services from SEO consultants they know and trust. Here are some tips to get leads directly in your LinkedIn inbox: Share your expertise: Offer insights on common SEO challenges, share findings from your experiments, present opinions on controversial SEO topics, or detail case studies.Be authentic: Ensure your content is unique, personal, and genuine.Prioritize quality over quantity: While consistency is essential for growth on social media, it's preferable to post one high-quality post per week rather than two average ones.Stay updated with the latest algorithm updates: Familiarize yourself with the social platform's algorithm to optimize your posts for visibility. 7. Outreach to your ideal customer Proactive outreach is vital to discovering businesses in your target niche that require SEO services. The secret lies in crafting personalized pitches that specifically address their unique challenges. Consider taking the Moz SEO Client Prospecting course for a more in-depth approach. Here is a sample outreach message that helped me get a meeting with the CEO of a well-known LLC formation service: It required a standard follow-up to land the meeting. So, follow up at least three times to increase the chances of getting a response. My follow-up: “Hey {firstName}, I’m just following up in case you never got my email:)” His answer: Hey Lucio! I would love to talk about this; I’m definitely interested. Are you available this Wednesday at 15:00? Here is my Calendly link. 8. Prepare for the sales call Streamlining your sales process can be more effective than the traditional two-meeting approach. Start by sending a pre-call questionnaire to gather essential details: Have they invested in SEO before, and with whom?What are their primary goals and priorities?Do they have an IT team for technical implementations?Is there an in-house content writing team?Are there plans for website redesign or migration?Is a specific budget allocated for SEO?When is the project's intended start date?Are there any particular concerns to be aware of? With these answers, you can tailor a proposal that directly addresses the client's needs, underlines the value of SEO, and positions you as the ideal partner. Structure your proposal presentation as follows: Who you are: Introduce yourself, your expertise in their industry, and why you're the best choice for them.The importance of SEO for the client: Begin by emphasizing the benefits of a robust SEO strategy for their business.Current SEO status: Inform them about their current SEO performance and highlight gaps you can fix to improve business performance.Timeline: Clearly outline the project timeline, detail key milestones, and your approach. Be cautious not to overpromise.Pricing: Be transparent when discussing the cost of the project.Case studies: Use past successes that resonate with the client to establish credibility.Service details: Explain each service in detail, including sample deliverables, particularly if you’ll share the project with others in the client's organization.9. During the sales call A successful sales call requires preparation, adaptability, and a genuine connection with your prospect. Here are vital tips to help you crush sales calls: Be presentable: Make a solid first impression, especially in video conferences. Good lighting, a stable internet connection, and a friendly demeanor can significantly impact how you’re perceived. Start the conversation: Begin with a light, casual conversation to ease tension. Simple questions about how they’re doing can help you get to know them briefly. Go through the presentation: Observe your prospect's engagement and respond to visual cues while presenting. Encourage them to ask questions and address their concerns immediately. Discuss pricing: Pay attention to their reactions when discussing rates. Highlight the benefits of each service to justify the investment. Negotiation: Be open to negotiation but maintain your project's integrity. If you offer concessions, ensure they are balanced with benefits to your business. Define clear next steps: End the call by outlining the next steps and confirming when the prospect will decide. This sets a clear timeline for follow-up communications. Time management: Effectively manage time by inquiring about their availability for follow-up meetings. Aim to wrap up your presentation at least 5 minutes before the end to allow time for questions. 10. Follow up after the sales call Post-sales call, if your prospect hasn’t responded by the agreed-upon date, don’t assume disinterest. Instead, proactive follow-up emails can help regain their attention and demonstrate your continued commitment to the project. Here are some examples of effective follow-up messages: Follow-up 1: Inquire about their decision timeline.Hey {First Name}, I'm planning my October schedule and wanted to check in on {Company Name}'s decision regarding the SEO project. Knowing your timeline will assist me in allocating resources for the project. I’m excited about this project's potential and confident we can achieve [their goals]. Follow-up 2: Reiterate the importance of the problem. Hey {First Name},I wanted to follow up to see if addressing {client pain point} is still a priority for you. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification. Follow-up 3: Assertive approach to prompt a decisionHey {First Name},I don't want to push if the SEO project I've laid out isn't what you're looking for. I thought this was high on the priority list, but if things have changed, please let me know.It would mean a lot :) 11. Retention: Build a base of monthly paying customers Stability is crucial for freelancers. To achieve this, build a consistent revenue stream and nurture long-term client relationships. Here are effective ways to develop a retainer base: Monthly retainer Encouraging clients to commit to a monthly retainer is an effective way to ensure predictable income. SEO, by nature, demands continuous attention and adaptation. Clearly define the services included in the retainer, emphasizing the importance of ongoing SEO support and the risks of neglecting it. Offer an option to exit the retainer with a 30-day notice to demonstrate confidence in your services. Service quality Client retention hinges on two key factors: delivering excellent customer service and meeting SEO expectations. If either falls short, clients may look elsewhere.To deliver a great customer experience: Aim to respond to emails within 48 hours, and if a delay is expected, inform them of when they can anticipate a response Keep the client relationship active with regular check-ins or updates, and stay proactive in seeking better ways to serve themRegularly provide reports demonstrating progress and how your work aligns with their goals and business objectives. Upsell current clients Focus on deepening relationships with existing clients who trust you and have seen a return on investment. Upselling simplifies your workload and allows for more personalized attention. Approach to Upselling: Highlight past successes to build confidence.Point out untapped opportunities in their current strategy.Connect additional services directly to their business goals.Consider bundling services for added value and convenience.12. Ask clients for referrals Satisfied clients are often your best advocates and can become valuable sources for new business. Here's how and when to ask them for referrals: Timing: The best time to request a referral is after delivering significant value or achieving a major milestone in your project. For example, after you report on increased conversion or smashing traffic goals. How to ask: Approach the topic with gratitude. You might say, “I'm thrilled you’re pleased with our results. I'd be grateful for the referral if you know anyone who could benefit from similar services.” Referral incentives: To encourage referrals, consider offering incentives. This could be a discount on future services or a small thank-you gift. It reinforces the value of your relationship and keeps you in their thoughts for future referrals.

Start by evaluating your pricing, acquisition, sales, and retention strategies. Identify improvement areas and create a focused to-do list.
