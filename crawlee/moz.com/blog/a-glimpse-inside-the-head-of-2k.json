M By: mozUser1469147917838 June 5, 2006 A glimpse inside the head of 2K Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Because of being extremely busy at the moment, I'm going to make this post short and sweet. Below are some links that allow to see what I consider the best /most important reads during the past week: ClickZ has an interesting article about AJAX and web analytics. This is an important article for all AJAX users planning to monetize their website with advertising incomes. AdLogger is an interesting tool for analyzing AdSense beyond Google's reports. It has some very nice options and if you are a skilled programmer, I think you can come up with extensions to put things even further. Good keyword services are hard to come by, so I'm going to share a secret... eBay has a service called eBay Pulse, which is pretty nice when you attach it to other keyword services. The best part is that Pulse is available in all countries eBay exists; all you need to do is to change the domain part (for example http://pulse.ebay.ca shows what Canadians seek and buy) . Correctly used this is a tool worth a big pile of bucks and it opens windows to areas where you normally have problems finding keywords.
