E By: Ella_D January 13, 2007 Web 2.0 Registration Forms Review Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. A friend of mine and a skilled developer, Marc-Antoine Ross from DevTaxi, did a great review of Web 2.0 forms and I think it's worth reading! So here it goes: I decided to review the registration forms from most of the sites that made it to the invaluable Web 2.0 Awards. Most of the registration forms were very disappointing. Some will validate on submit, but will display very unclear messaging to the user when an error occurred Some look like an entry form to the FBI (Yahoo!) Some display the password in clear text in the form! Most of the registration forms had no JavaScript / AJAX validation at all. My Recommendations What can be validated through JavaScript should be done on submit or on change (email, password match, password strength) What can be validated through AJAX (username availability, email already registered) is a nice to have On submit, all errors will be reported at once with invalid fields highlighted, instead of stopping after each error found Each field's requirements should be displayed near the field Focus should be clearly changed to inform the user of the error to be corrected (focus to the first error found in the form) Error messages should be clearly visible. Different colors for errors than positive feedback. Feedback containers should be positioned in such a way the form doesn’t shift down when messages are changed. An input’s background and border color should be changed (to red) on error and its border to bold when focused. Terms should be \"Sign in\" and \"Register\". I find \"Sign in\" and \"Sign up\" too confusing. Where do I start again? Oh, that X at the top right Use labels in your forms! A Few Good Examples:1.Validates inputs on change, suggests improvements / errors. Not visually attractive. http://blummy.com/register.php http://www.newsvine.com/_tools/new/user 2.Simple and efficient http://looklater.com/do/createaccount http://eventful.com/register 3.Nicely designed, good level of feedback to the user https://secure.fluxiom.com/signup/private 4.I like the information provided to the user for each input http://multiply.com/user/join/ Again, thanks Marc-Antoine.
