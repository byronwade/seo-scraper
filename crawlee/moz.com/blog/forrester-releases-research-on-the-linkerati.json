By: Rand Fishkin April 23, 2007 Forrester Releases Research on the Linkerati Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Steve Rubel came back to blog just in time, showcasing this brilliant report from Forrester Research - Social Technographics. The graphic he highlights is incredibly revealing on its own: The \"creators\" group are basically the Linkerati here. \"Critics\", \"collectors\", \"spectators\" and \"joiners\" also fit occassionaly into that profile, as they can be part of a content piece's viral movement across the web. I actually take this research very positively - though 13% may seem like a small number, it's actually considerably higher than I would have suspected. A more participatory web means a sphere more apt to help great ideas and great content spread naturally. What I'd love to see even more is the \"creators\" group broken down further into sub-sects like: Bloggers Web Publishers Journalists Multimedia Content Creators Forum Contributors (though this may fall under \"joiners\" or \"critics\" as well) Academic Publishers etc. My other question would be watching trends over time - do more people become \"creators\" or \"critics\" or does the number stay relatively stable over time. I want to know if the MySpace generation will also become a generation of content generators, writers and linkers. p.s. If you want to buy the report from Forrester, it's $279... Maybe we need to start charging more for the SEOmoz articles? UPDATE: As Shor pointed out, the researcher, Charlene Li, discusses the data in greater depth and offers review copies to bloggers here.
