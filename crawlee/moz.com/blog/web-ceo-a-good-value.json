SEO Analytics The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Sorry for my non-existance lately, I'm back for good now! I've been playing around with this tool - Web CEO Pro, for a while and I've seen Rand mention he was a little bit tired of it because it was expensive, but I'd like to say that for a couple hundred dollars a year (if you don't get into their monthly fees), it can do a pretty good job and can be automated easily. It has some nice tools and can also generate sharp looking reports that you can brand with your company name. Here are a few examples: A keyword generator tool which works fine An HTML validator with decent SEO tips Automated search engine submissions (although I wouldn't touch it - its like sending a nuclear waste flag to the search engines) Inbound link checker from more than 100+ search engines and a comparison to your competition (always good to know what your top30 competitors are doing link gathering wise) Link text analysis: you actually see what words are used for linking to your site and can ask some correction if needed to heavy sites who link to you Despite the reports take a while sometimes (better run it on a great machine), it allows you to get SERPs for multiple keywords from multiple search engines against multiple competitors. You can even takeclasses from their specialists and get this: By using this tool, you can learn who is climbing the SERPs, who's going down, and compare it to your own SEO efforts. You can also study what they did to get there when you see major changes during your scans - and make sure you react to their actions to void their competitive advantage while remaining creative with new great linkbaiting / high valued content ideas. I think Rand is using the paid tools, but for anyone who want something that can give you nice reports for VPs and VCs and still generate some value for you, it can help you fairly well. Anyone have a better/faster system to accomplish most of those tasks / tedious reports? Copied! Back to Top",
