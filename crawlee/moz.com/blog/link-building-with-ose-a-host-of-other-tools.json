By: Rand Fishkin September 20, 2011 Link Building with OSE & a Host of Other Tools SEO Tools The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. In late August, I gave a free webinar called Link Building with Open Site Explorer. As is usual, I couldn't limit myself to just a bunch of Moz tools (always feel a bit too self-promotional when I do that), so I ended up covering more than a few others as well. I also ran through a link building methodology and process that I've seen a lot of professional firms adopting lately, though their specific systems are more advanced and customized than what I'm illustrating. Nevertheless, I thought it would be valuable to provide the webinar, in full video form, here on the blog, along with the slide deck. Many folks may not have found the webinar in our free webinars section (bottom of the page), and I think this info is pretty useful for anyone investing in link building and wanting to use OSE. Here's the video (92 minutes in total, the last 30 are Q+A): And here's the slide deck: Link Building with Open Site Explorer View more presentations from Rand Fishkin The tools I cover/mention include: Open Site Explorer Google (crazy, I know) The MozBar Excel or Google Spreadsheets Free SEOmoz API Key FollowerWonk LinkedIn Blogscape Google Reader Google AdPlanner MoreOfIt Link Acquisition Assistant FindPeopleOnPlus SEER Interactive's Twitter Link Building Spreadsheet (w/ Export.ly) If you're PRO, I'm doing another webinar this morning (about 9 hours after publishing this post at 10:30am Pacific, 1:30pm Eastern, 6:30pm London) on the End of Search without Social, and once again, I'll be illustrating a number of tactics that I think can be helpful for search marketing. p.s. Sorry for the non-unique content post; I'm just way behind this week and working to catch up. Hopefully it's not too terrible a sin. Promise to be back on my blog game soon(ish), maybe after Mozcation Lima this week (oh man am I excited about that!). Copied! Back to Top",
