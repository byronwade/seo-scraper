By: Tom Capper June 7, 2022 In Defense of Spam Score and the Concept of a Toxic Link SEO Analytics | SEO Tools | Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I‚Äôm writing this after John Mueller caused a minor stir on Twitter on Monday, with this post: The concept of toxic links is something that's made up by SEO tools -- I'd just ignore it, and perhaps move on to more serious tools.‚Äî üêù johnmu.xml (personal) üêù (@JohnMu) June 6, 2022 Now, at Moz we do not actually use this ‚Äútoxic‚Äù language in our tools or accompanying guides, so this probably isn‚Äôt aimed at us. That said, I do think there‚Äôs an interesting discussion to be had here, and our competitor Ahrefs made an interesting conclusion about how this applies to ‚ÄúSpam Score‚Äù third party metrics, which of course is a term we coined: Good thing we managed to resist this very popular feature request for quite a few years. üôÇ https://t.co/Obci3Gx4xs pic.twitter.com/0Uc1E1uCzi‚Äî Tim Soulo üá∫üá¶ (@timsoulo) June 7, 2022 At risk of getting myself eviscerated by John Mueller and perhaps the entire SEO industry on Twitter, I want to push back slightly on this. To be clear, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs wrong, or acting in bad faith. However, there is sometimes a gap between how Google talks about these issues and how SEOs experience them. Google has suggested for a while now that, essentially, bad (‚Äútoxic‚Äù) links won‚Äôt have a negative impact on your site ‚Äî at least in the overwhelming majority of cases, or perhaps even all cases. Instead, the algorithm will supposedly be smart enough to simply not apply any positive benefit from such a link. If this is true now, it definitely wasn‚Äôt always true. Even today, though, many SEOs will say this description is not consistent with their own recent experience. This could be confirmation bias on their part. Alternatively, it could be a case where the Google algorithm has an emergent characteristic, or indirect effect, meaning it can be true that something is (or isn‚Äôt) a ranking factor, and that it also affects rankings in one direction or another. (My former colleague Will Critchlow has talked about this pattern in SEO a bunch, and I have written about the distinction between something affecting rankings and it being a ranking factor.) Either way, whether links like these are negative or merely not beneficial, it‚Äôs surely useful to have some clues as to which links they are. That way you can at least prioritize or contextualize your efforts, or indeed your competitor‚Äôs efforts, or your potential acquisition‚Äôs efforts, accordingly. This is the purpose of Moz‚Äôs Spam Score metric, and other metrics like it that now exist in the industry. True, it isn‚Äôt perfect ‚Äî nothing can be in this space ‚Äî as Google‚Äôs algorithm is a black box. It‚Äôs also, like almost all SEO metrics, very frequently misunderstood or misapplied. Spam Score works by quantifying common characteristics between sites that have been penalized by Google. As such, it‚Äôs not magic, and it‚Äôs perfectly possible for a site to have some of these characteristics and not get penalized, or even remotely deserve to be penalized. We would, therefore, encourage you not to monitor or attempt to optimize your own site‚Äôs Spam Score, as this is likely to result in you investing in things which, although correlated, have no causal link with search performance or penalties. Similarly, this is not a useful metric for questions that don‚Äôt relate to correlations with Google penalties ‚Äî for example, a site‚Äôs user experience, its reputation, its editorial rigor, or its overall ability to rank. Nonetheless, Spam Score is a better clue than SEOs would have access to otherwise, as to which links might be less valuable than they initially appear. That is why we offer it, and will continue to do so. Copied! Back to Top",
