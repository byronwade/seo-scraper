By: Rand Fishkin July 12, 2006 Speaking Sessions at San Jose SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Good news on San Jose for all my conference considering amigos - SEOmoz will be completely over-represented Danny has booked me to speak on three different topics: On Monday, August 7th from 4-5:30pm, I'll be speaking on SEM via Communities, Wikipedia and Tagging. My presentation is titled - Brand-building, Link-acquisition & Traffic-growth via Social Tagging - I'm filling in for Nick W (of Performancing) who couldn't make it. On Tuesday, August 8th from 3:30-5:00pm, I'll be speaking on Search Algorithms with Bill Slawski and Jon Glick. My presentation - The Evolution of Evaluation: How Search Engines Recognize Manipulative Linking Techniques - will cover a lot of the link tactics that no longer work and why. On Wednesday, August 9th from 3:15-4:30pm, I'm on Link Baiting & Viral Search Success. This is my first ever pitched session that Danny's created - I'm hoping it's good enough to earn a permanent slot at the bigger shows. My presentation is called - Rand's 13-Step List for Linkbait Love - yeah, it's cheesy. In addition to all that speaking goodness, I'm also bringing with me a big chunk of the SEOmoz crew. Rebecca (who just returned from SES Miami), Kat (who's at the NextWeb conference in Amsterdam), Matt (who's leaving with me tomorrow to visit clients in San Francisco) and Gillian (who never gets to go anywhere). I think it was Jim Boykin who said - go forth, co-mingle and ye shall prosper, and I'm heeding that advice. SEOmozzers will be hanging out by themselves, attending different sessions, and looking for new people to meet and greet. Oh, and they're pretty damn good drinkers, too, so make sure to catch us at the bar in the evenings. Don't yet have tickets for San Jose? Use Kayak.com for airlines and hotels and follow this link for the conference passes. If there's one \"must-see\" event in the SEO year, it's this one - when else do you get to party at Google's headquarters, ride rollercoasters on Yahoo!'s dime and get drunk in 103-degree water?
