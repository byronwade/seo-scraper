By: Rand Fishkin May 22, 2006 Techmeme's in the Sandbox Blogging The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Just a quick note to those who might think that big names are immune to sandboxing at Google: Techmeme isn't ranking in the first 250 results for its name, despite having one of the tech industry's most robust reputations and a very enviable link profile (bolstered by a huge influx on the announcement of the popular news site's move). Since Matt's out of town, we'll have to rely on another Googler who reads SEOmoz to pick this up and take care of it. Honestly, though, why does this still happen? Wherever the sandboxing threshold is right now, you guys need to lower it a bit further. p.s. For some odd reason, Google isn't even indexing the pages. Yahoo! and MSN have it down. Even Ask has done some indexing. Copied! Back to Top",
