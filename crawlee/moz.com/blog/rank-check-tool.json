By: Rand Fishkin November 7, 2005 Rank Check Tool Keyword Research The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Rod Coleman emailed me last night about his new rank checking and monitoring tool. It's free to sign up for 10 terms or $5/month for up to 75 terms. It checks the following engines: Alltheweb Altavista AOL Google MSN Teoma Yahoo! The tool keeps track of your progress day-to-day and has a nice little graphing tool so you can see the ups and downs. I've signed up for a free account and think it's worth the time to check it out. Most larger SEO shops will have their own software that does this, but Mr. Coleman's is a good alternative for smaller outfits. Copied! Back to Top",
