By: Jennifer Sable Lopez August 2, 2012 MozCon 2012 Wrap-Up SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Last week, approximately 800 marketers from across the globe converged in Seattle for our annual conference, MozCon. The entire Moz staff attended as well, and we were all quite excited to have such a diverse set of attendees and speakers. For many of us, it was an experience we won't soon forget. Between the amazing speakers and brilliant content, to networking with the community, and even singing karaoke at the Garage, it was a magical three days. I wanted to wrap all the great photos, posts, and presentations into one neat package, to make it quick and easy to find everything. So let's just jump right in! Rand kicks off MozCon 2012 Jeremy Dearringer, Kim Greuel, and Muhammad Yasin chilling with Roger Look at this photograph... (every time I do it makes me laugh) With so much love for Roger going around, we tried to get photos with him and as many people as possible. We've uploaded all the photos and you can view and download them from our Facebook page. Check out all the photos with Roger: Day 1: July 25, 2012 Day 2: July 26, 2012 Day 3: July 27, 2012 But don't worry, those aren't all the photos! We went all out this year, and our photographer got shots of all the speakers and tons of pics around the conference and at the Garage party. We'd absolutely love for you to tag yourself in the photos and please feel free to download them and use them! Check out all the photos: Watch the Speakers in action Photos from around MozCon Pics from the Garage party Speakers Aleyda Solis and Fabio Ricotta hanging out with Roger Presentations o'plenty Yes, there will be videos to purchase. Whew! I just wanted to get that out of the way since that's the question we keep getting asked most often. :) We hope to have them available in the coming weeks, so watch for a specific announcement about that. We had an amazing lineup of speakers and have made all of their presentations available for download. Please feel free to check out the decks: Download all the Presentations Mary Weintraub and Rand Fishkin's \"Fireside chat\" Recaps, Liveblogs, and Memes Oh My!
