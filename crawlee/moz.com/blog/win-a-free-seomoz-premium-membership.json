S By: SeanMaguire January 10, 2008 Win a Free SEOmoz Premium Membership Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. A few days ago I received a kind message from Rebecca, congratulating me on receiving a free additional month of SEOmoz Premium (Goodness) Membership, for the contributions I made to the community in the month of December. First of all, you have to love a place that actually rewards you for blabbing incessantly, as I seem to have a tendency to do at times. :) Secondly, with all sincerity, I have received far greater benefit from this community than it has received from me and I thank all of you for that. Finally, I have already had a firsthand opportunity to benefit and learn from everything provided in the Premium Section. Those of you who are already Premium Members can attest to its tremendous value for the modest investment. There are tools, articles, guides, tips, premium Q&A, etc. It's all good. So, rather than accept the additional month for myself, Rebecca has graciously agreed to allow me to transfer it to another lucky Mozzer! I'm particularly pleased, because in case you missed it, a certain Rand Fishkin was recently awarded the title \"Most Giving Search Blogger.\" What better way to honor Rand and Co's tremendous contribution to the search community than by emulating (in a very small way) SEOmoz's modus operandi? Now, when I say \"...a very small way,\" I am referring to the modest investment it would take for you to sign up for a month of premium membership. However, in my opinion, the value derived is orders of magnitude greater than that. In fact, I would suggest you can build a solid SEO business using the tools and reference material provided. With that said, here's how you can receive the free membership. You simply need to submit a YOUmoz post between now and the end of the day on next Friday, January 18th (by midnight PST). Of course, the sooner the better - for voting's sake. Voting deadline is Tuesday, January 22nd, 5:00pm (PST). Simply by the total number of thumbs up votes your YOUmoz post receives by the community (thumbs down will not be counted), we'll pick the winner and Rebecca will upgrade your account for a month. Simple enough? The only rule is that you cannot currently or previously have been a Premium Member. If you're a first time contributor, you may want to visit the following two articles for reference. Making YOUmoz work for you (by Rand Fishkin) YOUmoz Revisited: Some Tips for Contributors (by Rebecca Kelley) I highly recommend to members that have been lurking in the shadows - Participate! Not only can you win the membership, but each will receive the great benefit of the tremendously supportive response of this community! That in itself is worth the effort. Good luck!
