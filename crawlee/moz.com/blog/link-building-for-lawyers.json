By: Jordan Hobbs Edited By: Emilie Martin January 8, 2024 Link Building for Lawyers: 10 Strategies to Help You Win in SERPs Link Building | Marketing Industry The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. As legal marketing becomes increasingly competitive, relying on basic SEO tactics isn’t enough. With more law professionals turning to digital marketing, standing out in search engine results pages (SERPs) has become increasingly challenging. Law firms should prioritize a solid link-building strategy to increase visibility, brand recognition, and search ranking. This guide is for all law firms looking to gain a competitive edge, from large multinational entities to solo practitioners. We’ll cover practical, lawyer-specific link-building strategies that elevate your online presence and help you secure more leads through SEO. A primer: balancing backlink quality vs quantity Understanding backlink quality is essential before starting your link-building outreach. A few high-quality backlinks are more valuable than numerous low-quality ones. High DA backlinks boost your website credibility and ranking potential, whereas numerous low DA backlinks do not have the same impact. Additionally, beware of spammy, low DA backlinks that could harm your site and risk Google penalties. The number of backlinks needed varies based on your competition. For law firms in low-competition niches, fewer backlinks may suffice. However, more competitive areas, like personal injury lawyer in New York, require more effort. A JurisPage study revealed that high-performing criminal defense websites average 18,761 backlinks, not all of which are high DA. The key is a balanced approach — aim for quality backlinks while maintaining a diverse link profile. To evaluate a website's DA and spam score effectively, use Moz’s free Domain Analysis tool. Meanwhile, here are some metrics you can use to measure link quality: Relevancy: Build links from websites that are relevant to the legal industry for a better contextual fit.Spam score: Prioritize building links from websites with low spam scores (less than 5% is ideal).Traffic: Look for a good balance between relevancy and traffic to maximize your potential reach.Link placement: Links placed within meaningful content as opposed to a footer or sidebar are more impactful.Opportunity for conversions: When possible, opt for links from websites that can not only drive traffic but also potential conversions.Domain Authority: Aim for sites with a DA of 30+, which have a higher level of authority and influence in the industry in question. 10 link building strategies to boost rankings for law firms 1. Create social media profiles Create profiles on platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook. These profiles allow for direct links to your website, although they do not contribute to your link equity or Domain Authority. You can share various content types, such as blog posts, videos, and case studies. The results include: Easy backlinksExpose your content to a broader audienceEncourage further social sharesDiversify your backlink profile For example, our client, Trey Porter Law, shares his videos and blog posts on his Facebook profile. While he intends to build links, he also generates referral traffic by enticing his followers to click on his shared content. 2. Build out your legal and local directory listings Legal directories are valuable for law firms as they cater to individuals seeking legal assistance. These platforms typically boast high Domain Authority (DA), contributing to your link profile and attracting referral traffic. Beyond profile creation, top legal directories feature reviews and use various promotional methods to amplify your firm’s online presence with valuable citations and backlinks. These citations act as mentions to improve credibility, while backlinks drive traffic and enhance SEO. For instance, Trey Porter's free Avvo listing includes CTAs to his website and direct contact number. Avvo isn’t the only option. Here are a few legal directories worth looking into. FindLawJustiaSuperLawyersAvvo A critical aspect to remember is consistency in your firm's name, address, and phone number (NAP) across all directory profiles. This uniformity helps in signaling your legitimacy to search engines like Google. 3. Answer relevant questions on websites like HARO, Quora, and Avvo A time-consuming but effective way to build backlinks, get referral traffic, and establish your E-E-A-T is to answer questions on HARO, Quora, and Avvo. They present a unique opportunity for lawyers to share expertise while promoting your law firm. Consistently answering questions or providing insights on platforms like HARO can lead to backlinks from high-authority domains and news websites. Avvo also stands out for law firms as it's tailored specifically for legal professionals. Anyone can ask questions, making it a great place to showcase your expertise. To streamline this process, consider these tips: Regularly monitor platforms: Dedicate weekly time to check platforms for relevant questions or requests.Focus on your specialty: Stick to answering questions within your law firm’s practice areas to maintain relevance and authority.Be authentic: Prioritize providing genuine advice and information over chasing a backlink. Authenticity and personality in your answers can set you apart.Use tools: Use platforms like Sourcee, which aggregate journalist queries from HARO and others, to find relevant opportunities. 4. Claim your unlinked brand mentions Unlinked brand mentions are a goldmine for law firms, representing potential backlinks from authoritative sites. These mentions are instances where your firm is referenced but not linked back to. Use tools like Mention to track online references to your firm. Contact the content creator when you spot an unlinked mention, especially on a reputable site. Then, politely request them to add a link to the mention, explaining how it enhances their content and benefits their readers. Here’s a template to get you started: Subject: Quick Request Regarding Our Mention on [Website/Article Name] Hi [Name/Website Admin], I recently came across the mention of our law firm, [Your Law Firm's Name], in your article titled \"[Article/Post Title]\" on [Website Name]. We're honored that you thought to reference us in your content. I noticed that there wasn’t a link attached to our mention, and I was wondering if you'd consider adding one. It would provide your readers with more context and enhance their experience. I understand you're busy, and I genuinely appreciate any help you could provide. Thank you for your time, and I'm here if you need more information about our firm or have any questions. Warm regards, [Your Name] [Your Position] [Your Law Firm's Name] [Contact Details]5. Leverage partnerships Utilize the connections you've established in the legal space, such as with legal tech companies and other law firms, for link building. Reflect on your existing partnerships, from the CRM tool you use to the law firms you refer clients to. Each partner represents a potential source for backlinks, and many are open to the idea. Consider expanding your network to new partnerships like legal journalism outlets. Tools like Buzzstream can streamline your outreach efforts, helping you find contacts and manage communications. Other collaborative opportunities include: Writing guest blogs for partner websites.Providing testimonials for products or services you've had positive experiences with.Collaborating on case studies with a legal tech provider. 6. Pursue legal awards and join associations Winning legal awards can boost your law firm's reputation and SEO. These awards often provide backlinks from their websites (typically authoritative and high DA) to their nominees and winners. However, be cautious of 'pay to play' awards. While the promise of a quick backlink is tempting, paid links from awards with questionable authenticity often lack the same value as merit-based ones. Consider targeting reputable legal awards, such as: American Bar Association (ABA) AwardsAmerican Association for Justice (AAJ) AwardsNational Law Journal Legal AwardsState-specific Bar Association Awards 7. Create helpful and shareable content Content creation is crucial for link building and improving SEO for law firms. Producing relevant, informative content can naturally earn backlinks. While blog posts are standard, diversifying content types can help you stand out. Consider creating: Videos answering common legal questions (like Trey Porter) to generate leads and backlinks.Infographics that visually represent complex legal information.Case studies to highlight your firm's successes.Detailed practice area pages.Engaging webinars on relevant legal topics. 8. Do some manual outreach While organic strategies are great, there's value in proactively seeking out backlinks. If there’s a particular domain where competitors are earning backlinks, it might be worth reaching out to the website. While this approach generally has a low success rate, a well-crafted and highly personalized email can improve your chances. Here’s a template to guide your outreach: Subject: Enjoyed Your Article on [Specific Topic]; Let's Collaborate? Hello [Recipient Name], I recently came across your piece on [Topic] and was impressed by [Reference to the article to show that you’ve read it]. I've written an article on [Topic] that could complement your work and benefit your readers. Would you consider linking to it? Looking forward to a potential collaboration. Cheers, [Your Name] Tools like Hunter.io can simplify finding the right contacts for scaling your email outreach. 9. Consider local sponsorships Local sponsorships, such as supporting charities and community events, enhance your law firm's community presence and attract valuable backlinks from .org sites and sponsored organizations. Also, local media outlets could cover these events, leading to more geographically relevant backlinks. These local backlinks improve your SEO and visibility in local search results. 10. Share your success with the media Many lawyers overlook the potential of the local media. But depending on your practice area and the nature of your cases, tapping into news coverage can provide visibility and backlinks. Consider Yoav Niv, a criminal defense lawyer known for taking on cases that resonate with current events or challenge legal norms. His cases often attract media attention. He maximizes this exposure by featuring the coverage in an 'In the News' section on his website, further amplifying the story. The key is to be proactive. Contact your local news outlets if you're handling a case that touches on trending issues or sets a new legal precedent. They might be interested in covering your story, which could lead to valuable media exposure and backlinks for your website. Use links to power your law firm's growth A website with basic SEO isn't enough in the competitive legal space. Link building helps you increase keyword rankings, attract new business, and maintain an excellent online reputation. To truly leverage these benefits, partner with an agency that offers link building services to ensure SEO achieves your business goals. Copied! Back to Top",
