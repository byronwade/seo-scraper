By: Rand Fishkin March 16, 2006 MSN Offers the Holy Grail of Link Searches Mobile SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. So I'm playing around with the MSN operators as per my post from last week and I stumble upon the holy grail of link searches: (linkdomain:kennedyfunding.com linkdomain:hardmoneyfunding.com) (-linkdomain:avatarfinancial.com) This search is showing only those pages that link to both kennedyfunding.com and hardmoneyfunding.com but do not link to avatarfinancial.com. You can actually use this to find co-citation linkers that currently exclude your domain and link to your competitors. One more example - this one on SEO. These are sites that link to Matt Cutts, Aaron Wall and the SEOConsultants directory but don't link to SEOmoz: (linkdomain:mattcutts.com linkdomain:seobook.com linkdomain:seoconsultants.com) (-linkdomain:seomoz.org) You can build some damn cool tools with these operators. Let's all pray that MSN doesn't shut them down. UPDATE: Yahoo! appears to provide accurate data on these searches too. More research coming soon. Copied! Back to Top",
