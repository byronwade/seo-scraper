By: Rand Fishkin January 15, 2009 Lindsay Perkin Wassell Joins SEOmoz to Lead our Consulting Business; Adam Feldstein Arrives to Head Up Product Development Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Intrepid surfers of SEOmoz may have already noticed the new additions to our team - Lindsay Perkin Wassell & Adam Feldstein. Many of you in the SEO field know Lindsay well from her role as Director of SEO at OnTargetJobs and frequent speaking and participation at industry conferences. Today, she's joining SEOmoz's team as the manager of our consulting operations. Adam is somewhat new to the world of SEO, though as Group Program Manager of MSN Autos for the last few years, he's certainly put some significant energy into the process. I'm thrilled to have both of these folks on board with us, and think an introduction is definitely deserved. Lindsay Perkin Wassell, Our New SEO Consulting Manager I first met Lindsay in 2004 while doing consulting for HCareers, one of OnTargetJobs' divisions in Vancouver. She was a demanding client and had a razor-sharp sense for SEO, Internet marketing, her company's product and, perhaps most importantly of all, how to make change happen in a big organization. It was little surprise to me that Lindsay was quickly promoted to the director role of Search Marketing & Analytics for all of OTJ's companies. Lindsay's also been a great friend of mine since moving to OTJ, and I feel both privileged and excited to have her on the team. As CEO, my bandwidth is thin, and although I hope our clients haven't felt it too harshly, my attention is divided and needs focus on long term strategy, business planning and leadership. While I expect that I'll still spend a considerable amount of time consulting with clients, particularly at the strategic level, I believe that SEOmoz will, as a whole, be a better company - both on the consulting and membership sides of the business - with Lindsay at the consulting helm. Consulting was, historically, the base of SEOmoz's business, helping companies like Yelp, NPR, Microsoft, Real Networks, Scribd and dozens of others take advantage of organic search opportunities. Since our funding, however, consulting has taken a backseat - it was less than 20% of our revenue last year. With Lindsay's arrival, we're looking to take on more of the many, many requests for consulting services that come to SEOmoz every day and leverage the intelligence and experience we derive from those projects to improve our tools, content and PRO membership service. Starting tomorrow, if you're seeking consulting services from SEOmoz, you can email Lindsay_at_SEOmoz.org directly. Adam Feldstein, Our New Director of Product Management Adam and I have known one another since 2003, and in that time, his strengths as a critical thinker, a talented technologist and an exceptionally capable wearer-of-many-hats have made themselves apparent. Adam's had great success transitioning Carpoint into MSN Autos and growing it through content, relationships and, yes, SEO. His arrival at SEOmoz will mean a more serious, analytical and detail-oriented approach to productization. Adam's big tasks will be taking over the direction and management of SEOmoz's tools & PRO membership services. He's going to be collecting a ton of feedback from our current members (nearly 3,500), people who've canceled, those who've never signed up and even those who've never heard of SEOmoz to help architect tools and content that delivers high, ongoing value. As part of that role, he'd love to hear from you - suggestions, comments, new product or tool ideas, etc. - and what's a warmer welcome than a full inbox on the first day?! :-) You can reach him via email - Adam_at_SEOmoz.org. p.s. I'm very much looking forward to blog posts from both Lindsay & Adam in the next few weeks, and if there's topics you'd like to hear about, you can certainly ping them about those as well. p.p.s. Lots of folks have been asking whether we'll be replacing Jane on the SEO team - Rebecca has been doing a bang up job managing client projects along with her regular site manager duties (though, as you've probably noticed, it's made her voice a little more absent on the blog), but I expect that she & Lindsay will be working together with me to grow the SEO ranks here in the near future, so keep your eye on the blog and our Twitter account (which we promise to update more often) for hiring news.
