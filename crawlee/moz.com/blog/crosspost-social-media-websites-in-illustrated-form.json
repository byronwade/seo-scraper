O By: Oatmeal March 26, 2007 Cross-Post: Social Media Websites in Illustrated Form Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I don't normally cross-post blog entries, but I figured this one was appropriate for the SEOmoz crowd. About two weeks ago I made a couple funny sketches of what social media websites would look like if they were all sitting around together. Social Media Websites in Illustrated Form If you haven't already seen it I highly recommend checking it out. Most of the office was in hysterics when they saw my depiction of Digg. I drew these mostly because I was killing time before my vacation to Maui; I didn't expect such a huge reaction. The Digg crowd was surprisingly positive, some of the comments could even be described as glowing (weird, I know. I guess to appeal to diggers you have to insult them first). One of the co-founders of Reddit even emailed me and asked if he could use my sketch as the Reddit logo for a day, which I of course agreed to. I'm a huge fan of Reddit; I've found the quality of content and community on reddit to be far superior to Digg. Having my drawing up there as well as having them send me a Reddit shirt was very, very awesome Copied! Back to Top",
