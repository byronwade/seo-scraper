By: Rand Fishkin October 15, 2014 Open Site Explorer's New Link Building Opportunities Section (and a Slight Redesign) Link Building | Moz Tools The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Why hello there! You're looking marvelous today, you really are. And, in other good news, Open Site Explorer has a bit of a new look—and an entirely new section called \"Link Opportunities\" to help make some link prospecting tasks easier and more automated. Come with me and I'll show you; it'll be fun :-) The new look We know a lot of folks liked the old tab structure but we ran out of space. With this redesign we now have the flexibility to add new features and functionality simply by popping in new sections on the left sidebar menu. It's a little bit more like Moz Analytics, too, and we figure some cohesion between our products is probably wise. New side navigation with plenty of room to grow and add new features (spam scoring and analysis, for example, will be coming in Q4—but shhh... I didn't actually ask for permission to talk about that yet. I figure begging forgiveness will work.) Improved filtering that lets you slice and dice your link data more easily. Notice How Fast the New OSE Is? Oh yeah, that's the stuff :-) You can still access the old Open Site Explorer's design for a few more weeks, but the new features will exist only in the new version. Introducing the new link opportunities section Need help finding outreach targets for your link building campaign? We're introducing three new reports that will help you build a curated list of potential targets. The new reports are available to all Moz Pro subscribers. If you're a community member, sign up for a Moz Pro Free Trial and you, too, can kick it with the new functionality.Reclaim links A filtered view of Top Pages that lets you easily export a ranked list of URLs to fix. Unlinked mentions Powered by FreshScape, you can use Fresh Web Explorer queries to find mentions of a brand or site without links. Ping sources that may have talked about your brand, website, people, or products without giving you a link and you can often encourage/nudge that link into existence (along with the great SEO benefits they bring) Link intersect Find pages that are linking to your competitors but not you. By entering two competitive domains (they don't have to be directly competitive; anyone you think you should be on lists with, or mentioned by the press alongside, is a good candidate), you can see pages that link to those sites but not yours. Getting creative with your targets here can reveal loads of awesome link opportunities. This, however, is just the beginning. Be on the lookout for additional insights and opportunities as we improve our link index—we've just recently grown the size of Freshscape, which powers Fresh Web Explorer and two of the sections in link opportunities, so you should find lots of good stuff in there, but it can be a challenge. If you're struggling with query formatting or getting creative around potential opportunities, let us know (in the comments or via Q&A) and we can give you some pointers or maybe find some searches that do the trick. What about the old OSE? We changed the workflow a bit and want to make sure you've got time to adjust. If you're cranking through monthly reports or audits and want a more familiar OSE experience, you can switch to OSE Classic for a limited time. Just click on the \"View in OSE Classic\" link in the top right, and we'll default to the old version. But keep in mind new features and enhancements, like improved performance and Link Opportunities, will only be available in the new release. We'll keep OSE Classic active until December 3rd in case you're feeling nostalgic. We'd love your feedback If you're using the new OSE and find problems, wish we'd change something, or have a particularly awesome experience, we'd love to hear from you in the comments below, in Q&A, or (especially if your issue is urgent/something broken) via our help team.
