Table of Contents Copied! By: Rebecca Kelley May 8, 2008 Thursday Roundup for the Week of 5/4/08 SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Stories, news, and other notable items from the past week: Sorry folks, no more link yahtzee since someone at WikiAnswers was smart enough to change the answer to the question I linked to in my zero star section. Hooray for progress! One star link: Apparently Microsoft may build a \"copyright cop\" into every Zune. See, Zune, this is why nobody wants to buy you. Two star links: Shoemoney says that SEO has no future, which is a bit of a hater thing to say, but his exact words are \"...in my opinion there just is no future in current SEO for Google...\" I could agree with that claim (emphasis on current SEO) since SEO is constantly evolving, so SEO practices that work today may not be effective five years from now. Prepare to be horrified: manbabies.com. WTF, WTF, W.T.F. Three star links: According to a blog post, \"Google may be adding geographic information about brick and mortar stores and service companies to the algorithm along with reverse IP lookup to help boost site rank for regular results.\" Need a gift for your son or daughter? How about road kill toys? They're adorably squishy! Apparently Thursday at noon is the best time to post blog entries. Maybe I should have delayed publishing this by 3 minutes...damnit. Search Engine Land reports Microsoft Live Search's new design going live. Ooh, how very minimalistic! Joe Morin's new company, Storybids, now has a website that's live. According to the site, \"Storybids is a simple yet extremely powerful website tool for media sellers and content buyers. We connect those with creative ideas for product placement with advertisers who want to place their products in user generated videos, mini-dramas and webisodes, music videos and online commercials.\" Lee Odden shares 5 new Twitter tools with us. Rand gives Summize.com his bearded seal of approval. My favorite SEO slash hardcore U2 fan, Matt McGee, is jobless. He provides some great tips on how to improve your SEO experience and knowledge and hopefully nail that SEO interview. Meanwhile, I'm starting a site called feedmcgee.com that will take donations (U2 schwag is acceptable) to ensure that our little small business SEM doesn't go hungry. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the yottabyte, which is 1,024 zettabytes, which is roughly a crapload of exabytes, a buttload of petabytes, an assload of terabytes, and a shitload of gigabytes...scientifically speaking, of course. Although MySpace received 74% of U.S. social networking visits in April 2008, it's a -5% change compared to the same time last year. Facebook, meanwhile. experienced a 32% increase in market share from last year and had 14.8% of visits, and some site called myYearbook had a 475% year over year change from 2007, enjoying 1.33% of visits this year. Brian Cuban (Mark Cuban's brother who I pretend I know well because we're friends on Digg) wrote a post asking whether a competitor is devaluing your keywords. He opines that keyword suits like the Orion Bankcorp v. Orion Residential Financial case in Florida will become much more common over the next decade. For more information about the court case, check out Sarah's great post about how the court order on negative keywords won't break the Internet. Hey, check it out, the Google Analytics Blog defines search engine optimization. The eCommerce and Entrepreneurship Blog weighs in on their definition. Galen Ward provides an interesting argument as to why you shouldn't link to your trusted partners. We generally advise against linking to your competitors or to those within your niche using the same anchor text/keywords you yourself are trying to rank well for. I'm betting that most SEOs will love this t-shirt; Rand has probably ordered at least 50. Stephen Colbert has been awarded the Webby Person of the Year. Mission accomplished, Google bombers! This comic accurately portrays the evolution of virtually every college student's life ambition. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to resume fervently watching the clock until it's beer thirty pm.
