By: Carter Cole February 23, 2010 SEO Chrome Extension - Comprehensive View of Page and Domain Data SEO Tools The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. After Nick announced the free Linkscape API, I decided to write a SEO extension for chrome. I wanted to focus on all aspects of SEO and not just linking (like some other extensions) as well as a fast clean UI. I organized data from the page and external signals into 5 categories: External Page Data, Page Elements, Social Media, Page Terms, Server / Domain Info, and Suggestions as well as enhancing some common SEO related sites like Google Webmaster Tools, Yahoo Site Explorer and Google Analytics Install the SEO SIte Tools extention and see for yourself... it's only one click and you won't be disappointed. External Page Data shows domain metrics link links and rank Linking to page and domain from Yahoo Page Authority, Domain Authority and links from SEOmoz Alexa popularity (with graph) links Google index date and PageRank along with domain trends Dmoz listing and compete.com data Social Media pulls shares and bookmarks from a number of places Page Diggs and Domain Diggs Recent tweets about the page along with total number of tweets Facebook shares, likes and comments Reddit points Delicious bookmarks Page Terms displays relevant page elements to SEO Meta Robots Meta Description Anchor tags and follow attribute) Header tags (H1-H5) Bold/Strong I/Em Meta Keywords Server / Domain Info checks the domain's IP and country and displays it on a map along with registrar information and WhoIs info Suggestions gives helpful on-page SEO suggestions about title tag, links on page, meta description, meta keywords (hey it can’t hurt) Page Terms (still a work in progress) performs term extraction and lets you do keyword research with Google’s keyword research tool It also has ability to enhance Google Webmaster Tools with links anchor text, if they are followed links and mozRank (or PageRank) of linking pages Adds Social media reactions to Google Analytics page details with Facebook shares, likes and comments as well as Delicious bookmarks and Diggs It also adds the link and anchor text info to Yahoo Site Explorer with mozRank (or PageRank) It is still being developed so I would love any feedback you could give me on it… Some future plans are: Keyword search volume in Webmaster Tools Indexed pages in Google, Yahoo and Bing Improved keyword research tools More site suggestion information StumbleUpon share data Get the SEO Site Tools Extention Now Get in touch with me on twitter I'm @cartercole and follow me for updates of new releases (but if you install the plug-in it will automatically update) [highly recommended] :) Copied!
