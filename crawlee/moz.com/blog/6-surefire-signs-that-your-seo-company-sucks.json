E By: Eric Siu May 14, 2012 6 Sure-fire Signs That Your SEO Company Sucks Marketing Industry This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. So you just signed with an SEO company or you've been with them for awhile. You outsourced because you didn't have the time or expertise for SEO, but you know it's important given the fact that inbound leads cost 61% less than outbound leads and 80% of clicks go to organic results. You've also long heard the negative echoes about SEO. Just look at what some common searches about SEO look like on Google: The question you might be asking yourself now is this: how confident am I with my SEO company? Are they as good as they say they are? What have the results been? To help you make a decision with your current SEO company or your next SEO company, this post will go over some red flags that will tell you how good a SEO company really is. If a few of these warning signs are present with your current SEO company, chances are they aren't as good as they say they are. 1. Mass Directory Submissions, Article Submissions, Social Bookmarking, Forum Comments Whenever you are promised 300 directory submissions, 500 article submissions, 2,500 social bookmarks, and 23,849 forum links, you should run. Run far, far away. Not a very reassuring sight to see, right? That's because these links are automated and are the very definition of what Google calls 'webspam'. Another warning sign is that these bulk links usually come in packages and are relatively cheap. In the SEO world, you usually get what you pay for. Key Takeaway: The old tactics of backlink spamming might still work, but they're just not as effective as before. You're also putting yourself at risk by adding dirt to your backlink profile. Why send negative signals that can cause your organic traffic to tank? Instead, you're better off adding value to the internet instead of creating trash. 2. Lack of track record Does the company have any impressive examples or references? What results have they brought? What metrics do they consider to be important? Some metrics you should probably be considering are: Organic traffic Organic traffic revenue # of organic keywords Conversion rate Ask them about the project they're the most proud of. Does it align with your online marketing needs or do they continually talk about vanity metrics? Key Takeaway: Check for testimonials, badges, or case studies on their site - anything to help build more trust with them. If these trust signals are missing, ask for some references. If they're unable to provide that information, that's another strike. 3. They emphasize rankings Rankings add into the equation of a successful SEO campaign, but there are other variables to consider when looking at rankings. At the end of the day, you are trying to make more money online. The most important thing that matters to you is your bottom line. Ranking #1 for a bunch of keywords low volume, low converting, low competition, and low buying intent does nothing to help your business at the end of the day. SEO Star Justin Briggs wrote about how ranking reports make your link building suck. It’s well worth a read. Tip: When researching keywords, look for the keywords that have: Relevancy Traffic Commercial intent Adequate competition A good place to start is your analytics and paid search data - look for the keywords that are performing well and start from there. Key Takeaway: If a company keeps talking about rankings, do a little digging and find out what metrics are at the top of their mind. Are they more focused on rankings or traffic and conversions? 4. Cookie Cutter Packages Here's what you might see out of some SEO companies: Silver Package - 10 Pages On-site Optimization - 100 directory submissions - 200 social bookmarks - 300 article submissions - 2 custom press releases Gold Package - 20 pages on-site optimization - 200 directory submissions - 400 social bookmarks - 600 article submissions - 4 custom press releases If you see something like the two examples above, then it's time to run for the mountains again. Companies that offer these packages are telling you that SEO is almost a robotic process that doesn't require much thought into it. If SEO was that easy, everyone would be ranking on the first page for all their dream keywords. Each website is completely different and it's almost never the same in terms of deliverables that a site needs. For example, if a site is brand new, then it might need to build links gradually versus an established enterprise company that has already built up years of authority. Key Takeaway: Avoid cookie cutter packages. Period. 5. They write for search engines, not people Is your SEO company writing unremarkable content that leaves you wondering why that was even written in the first place? Is it something useful? Or is it a bunch of drivel that adds little value? If it is, then it’s time to stretch those hamstrings again because it's time to start running for the mountains yet again. A great rule of thumb to go by when you're publishing content is to ask yourself 'Would I share this on Twitter?'. If not, then it's time to go back to the drawing board. Your content is your opportunity to shine and build trust with your readers. Give them something valuable and you'll be remembered. Sure, the search engines might give you credit for some well optimized content, but the returns you'll get on that isn't as valuable as building the trust with a potential customer. If you need more reinforcement, just look at the benefits of great content marketing: More long tail SEO More brand visibility Stronger social following More referring links Bigger fanbase & community More direct & bookmarking traffic Higher organic search rankings Higher conversion rate Key Takeaway: Producing great content is no longer an option, it's a must have. If your SEO company can't help you on that front, then it might be best to tell them to stop producing content for you because it can damage your brand. 6. Tunnel vision SEO is gradually converging with other online marketing channels and it's time for people to adapt. It's no longer just about switching up a few title tags and building back links. Usability and social play a big role with any site and go hand in hand with SEO. Having a website isn't enough, you need to create a great user experience. Creating great content isn't enough, you need to promote it. It also doesn't hurt to build great relationshipsfor content promotion either. Key Takeaway: Look for SEO companies that look at the bigger picture. These are companies that will help you piece the online marketing puzzle together and make the most of SEO. What To Do You can start off by asking prospective agencies some questions about SEO to see how comfortable you are with them. If there's any doubt about a prospective company, then there's no doubt. Pick someone that you're comfortable with that has a great track record. Referrals are especially helpful in this space. What are some other red flags for SEO companies? Copied! Back to Top",
