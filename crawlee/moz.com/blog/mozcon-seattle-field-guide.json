  "content": "MozCon Field Guide: Exploring Summertime Seattle SEO Events | Moz News By: Meghan Pahinui Edited By: Emilie Martin May 13, 2024 Table of Contents Copied! By: Meghan Pahinui Edited By: Emilie Martin May 13, 2024 MozCon Field Guide: Exploring Summertime Seattle SEO Events | Moz News It’s that time of year again! MozCon 2024 will be here before you know it (taking place June 3 & 4), and we here at Moz are so excited to see everyone IRL and via our virtual attendance option! As the event draws closer, we think it’s a great time to remind folks of everything you can do while visiting the Emerald City. Nestled up in the corner of Washington state, surrounded by forests, mountains, and the Puget Sound, Seattle is the largest city in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). It is home to industry giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Starbucks, and Boeing and is the birthplace of Grunge music (think Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam — all from Seattle). Whether you’re traveling from near or far, we’ve compiled a list of some of the amazingly fun, educational, and sometimes weird activities around the city — updated for 2024, of course. And if you haven’t bought your tickets yet, don’t worry! It’s not too late. Head on over to the MozCon hub to explore purchase options. Night Owl pricing is available now and can save you $300 on the price of tickets. In-person tickets are 95% sold out; grab yours now while you can! Save $300 with our Night Owl tickets, ending on May 17. For the sightseers If this is your first time visiting Seattle, or if you love more traditional “tourist” attractions, these stops should definitely be on your list. The Space Needle Often synonymous with Seattle, you can’t find a photo or piece of video footage of the Seattle skyline without this iconic landmark included. Originally built for the 1962 World’s Fair, the Space Needle now operates daily for visitors to take in a 360º view of the city. It is also home to the world’s first rotating glass floor. Visit Seattle/Rachael Jones Columbia Center Tower The Sky View Observatory of the Columbia Center is located on the 73rd floor of the “tallest public viewing area in the Pacific Northwest.” You can take in views of everything from Mt. Rainier to Bellevue from the viewing area and then grab a snack at the café. Pike Place Market This market is quintessential Seattle. Located near the downtown waterfront and founded in 1907, Pike Place is a must-see stop. It features local businesses of all kinds, including the infamous flying fish of the Pike Place Fish Market (featured in the opening credits of Real World: Seattle) and the first Starbucks. And for those with more time to explore, below the stalls of the street level is a maze of brick-and-mortar stores like Golden Age Collectibles (the world’s oldest comic book shop). Kerry Park Located in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, Kerry Park is the go-to place for majestic views of the city and Mt. Rainier. Commonly used for shots in TV and film that establish Seattle as the location, it’s a great place to catch the sunrise or sunset. Visit Seattle/Rachael Jones The Seattle Great Wheel At 60 meters tall, this ferris wheel is the largest of its kind on the West Coast. And if you’re scared of heights (like me!), it’s still a great site to see. Especially Friday through Saturday night when they light it up with a fun light show! Visit Seattle/Rachael Jones For the museum lovers Seattle is home to a plethora of museums. No matter what your topic of choice is, there is a museum for you. And if you’re planning to stay in Seattle a few days after the conclusion of MozCon, many of the museums participate in First Thursdays, which offers free admission on the first Thursday of every month. Be sure to check each museum’s website for more information. SAM The Seattle Art Museum features art from around the world with both ongoing and featured exhibits. The featured exhibits for June include Elizabeth Malaska: All Be Your Mirror and Calder: In Motion, the Shirley Family Collection. If you’re planning a visit to SAM, be sure to keep in mind that they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Visit Seattle/Rachael Jones Seattle Asian Art Museum Located at Volunteer Park in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, the Seattle Asian Art Museum is another location of SAM. The featured exhibit, Anida Yoeu Ali: Hybrid Skin, Mythical Presence, will be on display until July 7, 2024. This museum is open Friday through Sunday. Northwest African American Museum Self-described as “... an anti-racist, pro-equity, affirming gathering place of hope, help, and healing for the entire Northwest region that is building intergenerational cultural wealth,” the Northwest African American Museum is open Thursday through Sunday. If you can’t attend MozCon in person, the museum also offers virtual exhibits and online education programs. Museum of Flight Seattle has a rich aerospace history, and you can learn all about it at the Museum of Flight. This museum is larger than life, featuring exhibits about space and air travel, which include real planes (and a space shuttle full fuselage trainer!). MoPop Located below the Space Needle, the Museum of Pop Culture, aka MoPop, is such a fun experience! It features exhibits about music, science fiction, indie games, and the world of fantasy. These exhibits are filled with relics, props, costumes, and more from your favorite films and TV shows. They currently have a special exhibit on display called Hidden Worlds: The Films of LAIKA, which is all about the Oregon-based studio behind hit films like Coraline and ParaNorman. And don’t forget to check out their newest exhibit – MASSIVE: the Power of Pop Culture, featuring artifacts from movies like Terminator 2 and The Wizard of Oz alongside other tributes to recent trends. It is a must-see for any pop culture fan! MOHAI The Museum of History and Industry is located on the edge of Lake Union and features exhibits all about Seattle’s history. During June, they will even have a LEGO exhibit on display called Towers of Tomorrow with LEGO Bricks. This exciting exhibit will feature skyscrapers from around the world built entirely from LEGO bricks. National Nordic Museum Located in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, the National Nordic Museum “is the only institution of its size and scale in the United States to present the history and culture of the entire Nordic region … and the legacy of Nordic immigrants to the United States.” If you’re planning to visit this unique museum, just remember that it is closed on Mondays. Visit Seattle/Alabastro Photography For the book lovers and knowledge seekers Looking for your next book? Or maybe you just enjoy exploring libraries like I do. Regardless, here are some stops to add to your list. University of Washington Seattle is home to the University of Washington, which has a beautiful campus ready to explore. Check out Drumheller Fountain, the quad, and Suzzallo Library before heading over to the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture or Frye Art Museum. Seattle Central Library The stunning Seattle Central Library is located in downtown Seattle. The glass building was designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and features art throughout — a must-see for any book lover! Visit Seattle/Rachael Jones Elliot Bay Book Company Established in 1973, this charming bookstore was Seattle's first bookstore cafe. If you have time to browse and want to support a locally-owned business, be sure to check out Elliot Bay Book Company. They boast a collection of over 150,000 titles and offer events in-store. You can also order from them online. For the foodies Seattle and its surrounding areas are chock full of amazing restaurants, cafés, breweries, wineries, and more. Food No matter what you’re craving, there’s a restaurant for you somewhere in Seattle. If you’re looking for a place to start, check out Seattle Met’s 100 Best Restaurants list. Some personal recommendations: Rocco’s Pizza, Cactus (Southwest), and Barrio (Mexican), Mighty O Donuts (Vegan & delicious!), and Dick’s Drive-In (a Seattle staple). If you’re looking for ideas of where to eat while at the conference, be sure to ask a Mozzer! Coffee Although Seattle is home to Starbucks headquarters, there are tons of independent and locally owned coffee spots to check out. Some include Fuel Coffee, Caffe Ladro, Cherry Street Coffee House, and Herkimer Coffee. Looking for more suggestions? Check out Eater’s list of Essential Coffee Shops. If you’re interested in learning about the science and history of coffee and brewing, Seattle has you covered! Check out the Coffee Chemistry event at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Capitol Hill. They also offer various tasting events if you’re looking to try something new. Breweries Breweries are abundant in this area. And whether you’re looking to do a tasting flight or just grab a pint, the possibilities are endless. Right downtown, you have the Pike Brewing Company, and just up on Capitol Hill, you have Optimism Brewing Company. There are also three different Elysian Brewing locations here in Seattle. If you’re able to venture beyond downtown, you have options like Reuben’s Brews and Fremont Brewing. More into cider? Seattle Cider Company and The Woods Tasting Room have you covered. For students of the natural world Whether you’re traveling to Seattle alone, with your team, or with your family for MozCon, there is no shortage of exciting nature-related adventures here. Seattle Aquarium Located on the city’s waterfront, the Seattle Aquarium offers exhibits featuring all different aquatic wildlife (including otters!) and daily presentations. Visit Seattle/Rachael Jones Woodland Park Zoo If you’re able to venture just outside downtown Seattle to the Phinney Ridge neighborhood, the Woodland Park Zoo is a great place to explore. You can even participate in penguin feeding, animal keeper talks, or ride the historic carousel. Check out their Animal Babies page to see what new friends have been welcomed. Washington Park Arboretum The Washington Park Arboretum is open every day until dusk and is free to enter. This 230-acre garden escape is a must-see for any nature lover in the city. It consists of multiple trails to walk and gardens to explore along with a gift shop. If you’re traveling with a group, they also offer walking tours and tram tours. Seattle Japanese Garden The Seattle Japanese Garden is located within the Washington Park Arboretum and requires tickets to enter. This traditional Japanese-style stroll garden offers a tea ceremony. Additionally, from May through June, artwork from the Seattle-based Japanese artist Mari Ichimasu will be on display in the Travel Cats exhibit. Just keep in mind that this garden is closed on Mondays. Waterfall Garden Park Unable to make it out of the city but still want to experience nature? Have no fear! Just head over to the Waterfall Garden Park in Pioneer Square. Located at the site of the original UPS building, this small park has a beautiful waterfall with plants and greenery to enjoy right downtown. It even has tables available for a midday picnic. So grab a snack and a coffee and head over to this quiet spot for a rest. Visit Seattle/Alabastro Photography For the outdoor adventurers When people think of the PNW, they often think of the great outdoors. And for those who enjoy spending time outside, we sure do have a lot of opportunities to soak up the sun! There are lots of hiking and walking trails around Seattle. If you prefer the water, you can rent paddle boards and kayaks to explore Lake Union and Lake Washington. Or, if you’re planning on attending MozCon in a larger group, you may want to think about renting a small electric boat to tool around in. Visit Seattle/Rachael Jones Have a picnic overlooking the water at Gas Works Park — featured in the iconic paintball scene from the film 10 Things I Hate About You. Visit Seattle/Alabastro Photography If you’re looking for places to explore that offer an outdoor experience, be sure to check out the Chihuly Garden and Glass at the Seattle Center or the Olympic Sculpture Park. Or take a stroll near the Ballard Locks to see one of the busiest lock systems in the country. You can also spend some time at their botanical garden and see the fish ladder. Pro tip! Wondering how the locks work? You can learn all about it at MOHAI! Visit Seattle/Alabastro Photography For the sports fans Want to catch a game in a different city? Seattle is home to plenty of professional sports teams! Baseball T-Mobile Park is home to the Seattle Mariners. Although they’ll be on the road the week of MozCon, if you’re arriving early and want to catch a game (or maybe a foul ball), you can see them play the Angels on June 1 or 2. Soccer & Football Although you won’t be able to catch a game while in town, you can still check out Lumen Field — home to the Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Sounders FC, and OL Reign (Seattle’s Women’s Soccer team). And you can still check out the team shop to pick up some gear for you or a fellow fan. Visit Seattle/Rachael Jones Basketball The Seattle Storm will be home at Climate Pledge Arena (where Seattle’s NHL team, the Kraken, also play) on June 4 to play the Phoenix Mercury, in case you want to check out the four-time WNBA Champions. For the pop culture aficionados If you’re into pop culture and are looking for some interesting stops to add to your Seattle tour list, we’ve got a few ideas for you. Jimi Hendrix Statue Although its real name is The Electric Lady Studio Guitar, it’s fondly referred to as the Jimi Hendrix Statue, and you can check it out in the Capitol Hill neighborhood on the corner of Pine and Broadway. Fremont Troll This infamous statue is located under the George Washington Memorial Bridge in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. It’s been featured in films like 10 Things I Hate About You and the TV show Once Upon a Time. Visit Seattle/Alabastro Photograph Kurt Cobain’s bench Are you a Nirvana fan? Then, be sure to add Viretta Park to your list of places to visit. This park is near the home of Kurt Cobain, and although you can’t see his house, there is a bench there that has become a memorial to the musician and is covered in fan messages. KEXP Gathering Space KEXP is a beloved non-profit radio station here in Seattle. You can stream them anywhere in the world through their app (and I highly recommend you check them out — they have amazing themed shows each night of the week). They have a public gathering space in Seattle Center, which features a café, record shop, and a window into their studio. It’s a great place to relax and have a cup of coffee. Visit Seattle/Alabastro Photography SIFF Cinema Movie buff? Seattle is home to one of the largest film festivals in the world — the Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF). Although the festival won’t be at the same time as MozCon, they offer year-round showings of movies from around the world. If you’re looking to check out a unique film that you may not get to see on the big screen elsewhere, check out the showtimes of the SIFF Cinema Uptown Theater or SIFF Cinema Egyptian Theater. For the eccentric explorers We can’t wrap up this list without including some of the outside-the-box activities and locales. So here are a few things to check out if you’re looking for something outside the standard fare. Gum Wall Although technically part of Pike Place Market, this attraction deserves its own entry on our list. The Seattle Gum Wall is exactly what it sounds like — a wall of gum. People come from all over to stick their gum to this brick wall hidden down an alley of the market. Fun (or maybe gross?) fact: the wall has only been cleaned off twice in its history — in 2015 and 2018. The cleaning occurred to help preserve the wall itself. Fremont neighborhood We’ve mentioned a few places in Fremont already (the Fremont Troll and Fremont Brewing Company) but if you have time to explore this neighborhood more fully, it is a fun and quirky area that doesn’t disappoint. Not only is it home to lots of fun shops and restaurants, but also a statue of Lenin, the Center of the Universe sign, a rocket, and dinosaur topiaries. Be sure to take a walk by the Waiting for the Interurban statue, too. It’s tradition to dress up the figures for different occasions and holidays. Visit Seattle/Alabastro Photography Underground Seattle Tour Back in 1889, a fire destroyed a large section of Seattle’s downtown. The citizens of the city opted to rebuild — on top of the existing city! Now, there is a network of buildings and tunnels below present-day Seattle from the original city. You can take tours of Underground Seattle in Pioneer Square. Seattle Pinball Museum Like pinball? Feeling nostalgic? Check out the Seattle Pinball Museum — and bring some quarters! Visit Seattle/Alabastro Photography Art-o-mat Art Vending Machine Located at Venue Ballard, this repurposed cigarette vending machine now dispenses art. Art-o-mat machines vend original art and are a fun way to expand any art collection. Final Thoughts Whether you’re from the Seattle area or you’re coming in from out of town (or country!), we hope you discovered some fun ideas to bookend your MozCon adventure. If you haven’t purchased your tickets just yet, be sure to check out soon so you don’t miss out. And if you’re having trouble convincing your boss (or yourself) to send you to the beautiful Pacific Northwest, check out our Convince Your Boss blog post and final agenda to learn even more about the event.
