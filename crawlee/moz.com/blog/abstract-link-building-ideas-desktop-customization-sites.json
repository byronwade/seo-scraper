E By: elbrian April 15, 2009 Abstract Link Building Ideas: Desktop Customization Sites Link Building This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. It seems every web developer's biggest concern, excluding keyword density/research, is finding new and innovative ways to create quality inbound links back to your website. While there is no easy-button to begin generating inbound links, there are certainly many abstract approaches and techniques a developer can utilize to make inbound link generation a bit less tedious. In this entry, I will explore a few \"desktop customization\" websites that do NOT nofollow links in member profiles. That is, you can sign up to these sites, submit some sort of image to be featured on their site, and immediately begin reaping the reward. The benefit to utilizing this strategy is in the fact that by creating one computer desktop wallpaper and submitting it to various sites, you are generating quality inbound links from websites with large sums of traffic and high page ranking. Here are a few examples that allow for followed links to be placed in member profiles: http://desktopwallpaper.in http://interfacelift.com http://desktopwallpapers.co.uk http://desktopnexus.com (Note: sometimes they use nofollow, but the large community is sure to provide plenty of traffic) There are lots of other sites that you can apply this technique to. If desktop wallpaper sites aren't for you, try some MP3 sharing sites or possibly comment on some blogs that hold decent PR. I hope this entry helps to stir up some neat ideas; it's this type of abstract thinking that allows a developer to set his/herself apart from the crowd! Copied! Back to Top",
