J By: josey October 23, 2007 Pubcon, Who, What, Where, When, Why, & How Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I just signed up for the early bird registration with Webmaster World to attend my first Pubcon. It's in Las Vegas, December 4-7, at the Las Vegas Convention Center. It sounds like it will be quite an event. Are you going to be there? In all honesty it will be the first webmaster/SEO event I have ever attended. However, in the last two years I have listened to Danny Sullivan on Webmaster Radio sigh and rant enough to know a lot about him. I know that he's from Newport Beach, CA, and he may not have ever finished that tree house for his kids across the pond. And that just is Danny... there is Daron Babin, the sailor, his wife with the sexy voice, Brandy, infamous wise guy David Naylor, red-suit wearing Mikkel deMib (even though I have never seen it), Jeremy Shoemaker, Nebraska player, Jennifer Sleg, Canadian content guru, Todd Friesen, Maple Leaf gone good, the guys on SEO 101 who always talk too slowly, Greg Boser, the man, the myth, the guerilla. And I can't forget Monty Keep-Your-Eyes-on-the-Prize Conn. I guess I really love these people for talking about on and off-page SEO, search marketing, and domaining, because that is what interests me. I learn most from others in the industry, and I think most do. Here is my dilemma. While at Pubcon I can only attend some sessions. There will be no listening to podcasts while I'm driving. I have to pick and choose. So, how do I choose? What do you recommend? Who are the presenters that are great in person? Who is not to be missed at Pubcon? What do you do to make your event experience the best? What is your approach to getting the most out of an event like this? What should I expect? Pointers please! Copied! Back to Top",
