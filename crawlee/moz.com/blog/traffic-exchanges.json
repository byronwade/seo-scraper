M By: manthy October 29, 2007 Traffic Exchanges Social Media This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. For the past year I have been using traffic exchanges to try and get visitors to my website, and I have come to a conclusion: while they will provide hits to your website, traffic exchanges do not work for getting quality traffic. Most of the traffic exchanges I use are auto surfs, meaning that you click an autosurf now button and you start surfing. The idea is for every site you visit, they will send a visitor to your site. Well, you do get a visitor, but I have come to the conclusion that 99% of the people autosurfing are not even at their computer when thyy are surfing; in fact, most people just set the auto surf and go to bed (myself included), so you really aren't getting quality traffic, just an automated visit. Also, you get multiple visits from the same people....are they ever going to actually visit your website? I don't think so. I would say that I have picked up more viruses/trojans than I have customers from traffic exchanges. In closing, I believe that the only way to get quality traffic to your website is with careful SEO and building your site with the proper keywords, meta tags, etc. I just wish that it didn't take me a full year to come to that conclusion.
