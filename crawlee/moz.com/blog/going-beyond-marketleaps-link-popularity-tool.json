By: Rand Fishkin August 22, 2006 Going Beyond MarketLeap's Link Popularity Tool SEO Tools The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. In the next 6-8 weeks, SEOmoz is looking to launch a link popularity measurement tool. The gold standard in our industry has long been MarketLeap's classic link popularity checker, but over the last few years, it's become less powerful and relevant. Our goal with this new tool will be to allow users to compare link numbers from several domains at a time through all of the major services that currently provide link data. The following are the pieces of information I feel will be most valuable: Link count from Yahoo! Site Explorer (e.g. SEOmoz - 119,469) Link count from Yahoo! Site Explorer last page (e.g. SEOmoz - 114,341) Link count from Yahoo! Search (e.g. SEOmoz - 181,000) Link count from Yahoo! Search last page (e.g. SEOmoz - 175,000) Link count from MSN (e.g. SEOmoz - 105,991) Rank from Technorati (e.g. SEOmoz - 155) Link from Blogs via Technorati (e.g. SEOmoz - 7,883 from 2,590 blogs) Link count from Technorati (e.g. SEOmoz - 9,509) URL count from Google (e.g. SEOmoz - 610,000) URL count from Google filter off, last page (e.g. SEOmoz - 987 of 609,000) Link Count from Gigablast (e.g. SEOmoz - 409) Inlinks from Alexa (e.g. SEOmoz - 1,305) To some, these 12 points of data might be overkill, but I think that a link tool that provides this level of detail would be invaluable for comparison purposes. Over time, I'm guessing that the data in aggregate could influence how we see the numbers and which we select as being most representative and accurate. I've got one last question - are there any other pieces of link or link-related data that you'd want to see? Copied! Back to Top",
