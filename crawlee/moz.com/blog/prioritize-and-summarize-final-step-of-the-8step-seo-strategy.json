L By: Laura Lippay July 5, 2010 Prioritize and Summarize - Final Step of the 8-Step SEO Strategy Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. My friends, you’ve made it. You’ve sat through over 10,000 words I’ve shoveled into these SEO Strategy posts (so far), and for that you deserve a serenade. This serenade calls for a nice glass of wine (preferably a good Tokaji to go with the music) and a comfortable seat while we wrap up our journey together. Got your wine? Ok, now let the exceptionally gifted Sandor Lakatos send some beautiful Hungarian gypsy music through your speakers and let’s begin the end. (PS - If you really like this music I suggest this album) There are two things you can potentially do here to wrap this up. The first, prioritization, is optional. The second, summarizing the document in an overview, is pretty important. If you’re not into prioritizing all this stuff you’ve put together then just go right to the Overview section and skip the Prioritize one. Here we go. PRIORITIZE Well, hello go-getter. Glad to see you’re ready to do some prioritizations. There are two ways I’ve done this before, and at this point I don’t need to tell you again that however you want to go about this is up to you. Create this document in the manner that seems best for you. a) Prioritization Summary After you’ve created your magnum opus of specific recommendations in Step 6 that will make the next big internet sensation out of your client’s product, you may want to take all of those recommendations and wrap them up in a nice (short) summary that says, “this is the most important thing you can do, and these things are very important also”. Let them know where they can start and what they cannot ignore if they want to see results. This is different than the overview which we’ll look at later, that will summarize the entire document in a much more broad manner. This is specific to the recommendations that you’ve listed. You and I know that the more of the recommendations they follow (especially the high-impact ones) the better off they’ll be, but you and I also know that the chances of the client implementing 100% are usually not so great, so make sure you let them know what’s the most important. b) Prioritize by Item This is more time- and labor-intensive, but I’ve found it has really helped for teams who have a lot on their plate. Prioritizing each task that you’ve given your client in Step 6 can help them place your recommendations in their queue along with the 1,000 other things they’re working on, without having a doubt as to what will potentially make the most impact. Without specific prioritizations they might just implement whatever is easiest, and then call you in 4 months when there hasn’t been any change in results. For example, the template I’ve built has prioritizations to choose from built in, so that I can stick these in wherever necessary. If I have several recommendations under a category (like Specific Content to Build), then each recommendation within that section will get a prioritization. Feeling even more ambitious? (Might be the sugar in the Tokaji – go with it!) Note which team each recommendation should be owned by. For example, recommendations for external linking might be relevant to Design, Web Dev, and/or Biz Dev. Specific terminology recommendations might be relevant to Writers/Editorial. I’ve learned the more you give them the more they’ll get done, and the better it will look for you – both in presentation and when they start seeing results. SUMMARIZE IN AN OVERVIEW This is it. This is the big shiny bow on this custom handmade contribution of your unmatched talent and innate inner wisdom that you’re lovingly bestowing upon your client. The crescendo, if you will. The overview is for the beginning of the document. Rather than just jumping right into demographics and recommendations, give the client a short summary of the purpose of this document and what they’ll find in it. Here are some of the things you might consider putting in this one or two paragraph overview (I don’t suggest it be much longer than that): Summarize why this document has been commissioned – what is the goal they are trying to attain Recap the issue(s) the client is having now (the reason they’re seeking your help) Explain the potential outcome the client can attain after implementing Explain the originality of this document – that it is a custom set of recommendations created specifically to meet the clients individual visibility needs (or something like that). And that it is not a best practices document. This, by the way, follows the typical steps to persuasion (shown here in my words): Show how awesome life would be if everything was perfect and nothing needed help Show the reality – here is a problem & here’s how its hurting you Let them know you have the solution for them Let them know the solution is attainable if they take action Give them the tools to take that action (this is really the rest of the document) By the time they’re done reading your overview they’ll be salivating for what’s in this SEO Strategy document. And with that we come to a close of the 8-Step SEO Strategy. Thanks for taking this journey with me and I hope some of the info in these 8 steps has given you insights and ideas to make you worth gobs of money. :) So go forth and conquer dearest SEOs, and don’t forget who led you on the path to multi-million-dollar SEO fame when you get rich off of this stuff.
