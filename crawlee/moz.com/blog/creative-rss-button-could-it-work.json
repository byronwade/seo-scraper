Table of Contents Copied! By: Ann Smarty March 28, 2008 Creative RSS Button - Could it Work? Content Marketing The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The number of subscribers is the main metric of a blog's popularity (I am pretty sure everyone knows that but I needed an introductory sentence :) ). Recently, I've been exploring and experimenting with some creative looking blog RSS buttons and came to an interesting conclusion: no matter how unique and prominent it looks, people still tend to prefer that standard little Feedburner button that humbly asks to subscribe. Is that because it looks so familiar that it catches a reader's attention and clearly denotes the action? I tend to believe that's actually the answer. Does it mean standing out does not necessarily mean encouraging action (people obviously see it but they just don't feel like subscribing)? Is there still a creative solution? Anyway, I did to little testing to make any statements. Webmasters still use different creative ways to encourage people to subscribe, and when done wisely, that might work. Some essential rules I tried to sort out are: a non-traditional RSS button should be preferably orange, as that's the standard color for it a creative RSS button should resemble a traditional-looking one in form and feel a creative RSS button might be supported by the call to action Here are a few examples: Type: thematic Source: The Soccer Weblog Features: highly relevant to the blog content (=> associative); orange (=> makes it clear what action it calls to) Type: humorous and dynamic Source: Jamie Huskisson Features: amuses, attracts and fixes attention Type: Denotes the action Source: BrianRobinson Feature: describes the action Type: text invitation Source: Saving for a Wedding Feature: calls to action Type: traditional button + text call to action Source: Next Generation Materials Features: looks familiar and calls to action Type: brand-logo consistent Source: Today's Hottest Deals Features: looks familiar and matches the brand Type: traditional image interpretation Source: CUFX Features: entertaining, attracts attention (and looks familiar) So my question to you, dear Mozzers, is: have you ever tried to play with your blog RSS button? Have you succeeded? Do you think it might work? (Thanks in advance for your help). Copied! Back to Top",
