By: Rebecca Kelley March 15, 2007 Wikipedia: Now Telling You What's What While You're IM'ing Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. While chatting with a fellow SEO (whose identity I concealed, just in case he doesn't want his screen name public) over IM, I noticed that certain words were being underlined in green. When I hovered my cursor over an underlined word, I got a little pop-up definition, courtesy of Wikipedia. They even defined what \"haha\" meant (I slapped a border around the especially amusing part of the definition): So that's what the extra \"ha's\" mean! How very insightful! Unfortunately, there's still a little problem with context: Not quite sure this guy meant \"going to go to the Genesis YM2612,\" but I could be wrong.. P.S. As Oilman pointed out in the comments, this feature has apparently been around for a while, but I'm a slow loser so oh well. Copied! Back to Top",
