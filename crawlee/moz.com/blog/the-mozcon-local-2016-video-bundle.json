By: Erica McGillivray April 5, 2016 ​Hot off the Presses: The MozCon Local 2016 Video Bundle Local SEO | Moz News | SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. As an online marketer, Local SEO and Marketing sometimes feels like you're 8 years old and don't know to flip the cassette over to the other side (because you were born in 2008). But have no fear — that's part of the reason why we invited 16 local industry experts to share their best advice, tactical tips, data deep dives, experiences, and case studies at MozCon Local 2016. And for those of you who already groove to the Local SEO tune, we focus on bringing intermediate and advanced talks so you can level up. For those who are like yes, please, now, and wow, it's only $99: Give me the knowledge! I'm already sold. Special note for MozCon Local 2016 attendees: You should've received an email with a secret decoder ring (err, link) for your video access included in your ticket costs. If spam filters or your dog ate it, email our team at mozcon@moz.com. Justine Jordan talks mobile email Need a little convincing? (Or maybe you just like my blog posts. If you do, thumb it up!) For those of you who need more persuasion, here's what real MozCon Local attendees said about the knowledge level of these talks: 81% of the audience rated MozCon Local's knowledge to be at the perfect level. The MozCon Local 2016 videos focused on a wide range of local marketing and SEO topics, from digging deep into citations and ramping up link building efforts to working HTML headers in email marketing and which analytics you should focus on. With these videos, you get instant access to: 14 presentations (over 6 hours) from MozCon Local 2016 Video streams or downloads for your computer, iPhone, or Android device Downloadable presentation slide decks A few audience favorites from this year include Darren Shaw's Citation Investigation!, where he tests and studies which services work best for your business' listings; Justine Jordan's Optimizing and Hacking Email for Mobile walks you through how to make mobile email happen and all details you may not know; and Mike Ramsey's Local Links: Tests, Tools, and Tactics, which takes a look at ideas for genuine link building in 2016. Review all the topics! But wait... do you want a sample? Like Costco, we know that sometimes you need a little proof that those taquitos are delicious. You can watch an entire session for free! FREE! (It's the price everyone likes, except accountants.) Watch and learn from Kick Point's Dana DiTomaso. One of our highest-rated sessions at MozCon Local, she digs into how you can activate employees at your different locations to contribute to marketing efforts. She explores how attention to local detail will take your branding to the next level. And bonus, she pokes loving fun at Rand's hipsterness. Have I mentioned that ALL these videos are at a sweet $99?! Other things you can get for $99: 3 bags of the expensive cat litter my spoiled furbaby demands 1 Star Wars Remote Control BB-8 Droid 4 gourmet pizzas 1 month of Moz Pro! (also a great value ) 30 pool noodles off of Amazon While BB-8 will be fun, he can't help you with your site audits or social media execution. And one cannot live off pool noodles and pizza alone. So instead, spend that $99 on leveling up your knowledge with the MozCon Local 2016 Video Bundle. These videos are so rad that even Grumpy Matt approves. Copied! Back to Top",
