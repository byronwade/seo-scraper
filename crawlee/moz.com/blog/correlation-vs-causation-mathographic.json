Meyers September 21, 2011 Correlation vs. Causation (A Mathographic) SEO Analytics As part of our quest to understand the Algorithm, we do a lot of correlation analysis here at SEOmoz. We tend to dive right into the deep end, so I thought it might be a good time to take a step back and talk about the absolute basics of correlation, including some warnings about causation. We’ll often say (and hear) the fallback phrase – “correlation does not imply causation”, but people rarely dig into what that means. To make this experience as pleasant as possible for the math-phobic, I drew you a picture. I’d like to introduce the world’s first Mathographic. Ok, it’s probably not the world’s first, and it’s really just an infographic, but give a guy credit for trying to keep you entertained.

If you’re interested in more advanced topics on correlation, here are a few references worth checking out: Correlation and Dependence (Wikipedia) Stastistical Signifcance of Correlations (SUNY) Spearman’s Rank Correlation (U. Delaware) Non-linear Regression (Graphpad) Some Correlation Humor (xkcd) Are there any other correlation-related topics you’d like to hear more about on the blog?
