By: Trevor Klein June 30, 2015 Help Us Improve the Moz Blog: 2015 Reader Survey Moz News NOTE: The primary set of results from this survey—753 responses—was downloaded for analysis on Tuesday, July 7. We're leaving the survey up, since it's never a bad thing to collect more results (we'll check back from time to time and see what's been submitted), but this marks the closure of our main push. Thank you all SO much for your time, and keep an eye out for the analysis—we'll have it up on the blog soon! In late 2013, we asked you all about your experience with the Moz Blog. It was the first time we'd collected direct feedback from our readers in more than three years—an eternity in the marketing industry. With the pace of change in our line of work (not to mention your schedules and reading habits) we didn't want to wait that long again, so we're taking this opportunity to ask you how well we're keeping up. Our mission is to help you all become better marketers, and to do that, we need to know more about you. What challenges do you all face? What are your pain points? Your day-to-day frustrations? If you could learn more about one or two (or three) topics, what would those be? If you'll help us out by taking this five-minute survey, we can make sure we're offering the most useful and valuable content we possibly can. When we're done looking through the responses, we'll follow up with a post about what we learned. Thanks, everyone; we're excited to see what you have to say! Can't see the survey?
