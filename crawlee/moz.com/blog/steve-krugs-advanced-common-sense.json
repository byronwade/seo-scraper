By: Rand Fishkin February 8, 2005 Steve Krug's Advanced Common Sense Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. One of the first requirements for anyone considering building or operating a website should be Steve Krug's miraculous book - Don't Make Me Think. This short, 3-hour read has been next to my desk since I bought it and I doubt it will ever move. Mr. Krug's simple ingenuity and intuitive reasoning are why I work so hard to design with usability in mind. A good thread at HighRankings discusses Mr. Krug's efforts and his recent interview with Management Consulting News, which sadly was not representative of his extraordinary insight and perception - either that or he's a much better writer then he is an interviewee. Also, if you have the budget, consider hiring Krug; I can say with certainty it will probably be the best website investment you make. Copied! Back to Top",
