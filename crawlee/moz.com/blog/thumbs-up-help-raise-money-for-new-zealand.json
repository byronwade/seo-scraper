By: Jennifer Sable Lopez March 3, 2011 Thumbs Up: Help Raise Money for New Zealand Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Today we're taking a different angle than we normally do on the blog. As you know, recently New Zealand and Christchurch specifically was seriously affected by an earthquake on February 22nd. After Rand sent out an email last week for those chosen to participate in the 2011 Ranking Factors, our friend Kalena Jordan from Search Engine College responded asking if we could help raise money for the New Zealand Red Cross to help with the aftermath of the earthquake. The answer was \"Absolutely!\" so we thought about ways to include the community. Donations For Thumbs Up SEOmoz will donate $1 for every (authentic, human-created) thumbs up on this post and every thumb to every comment (up to a maximum of $2,000) received by 12pm Noon Pacific Tuesday, March 8th. We also invite any organization (or person) to offer a 10% match (providing 10% of the thumbs up in dollars donated) and we'll add you to the \"matching\" list below. Want to match? Send an email to jen[at] seomoz.org to be added to the list. In order to get as many comments and donations as possible, we ask that you add your best, creative and unique \"white hat\" link building ideas in the comments. The idea is to then thumb up any and all of the tips you like and agree with to help get the thumb count high. You can also make donations directly to the New Zealand Red Cross. Information About the Earthquake On February 22nd, Christchurch was struck with a 6.3 magnitude earthquake which has caused devastation throughout the city. The New Zealand Red Cross is in desparate need of money to help the homelss and displaces. Currently, over 75% of the city is without water and half without power and sadly the death toll has risen to 163.
