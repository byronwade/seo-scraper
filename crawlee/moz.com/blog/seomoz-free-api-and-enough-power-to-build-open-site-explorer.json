January 27, 2010 Launching the SEOmoz Free API and Enough Power to Build Open Site Explorer Moz News The launch of Open Site Explorer last week opens up a lot of link data, filters, and anchor text to a much wider audience than we've ever had before. In that same vein, today we're announcing our new and improved SEOmoz Free API. Any registered (it's free) SEOmoz member can visit our API Portal and get an API key that gives you access to: Data for any URL in our index including Domain and Page Authority mozRank total link count external, followed link count The first 500 links to any page, sub domain or domain Filtering on those links: 301s, Follows, External, etc. The first 3 domains linking to any page, sub domain or domain The first 3 anchor text terms or phrases in links to any page, sub domain or domain You're welcome to use this data for private or publicly-facing purposes. We already have a variety of partners integrating this data including: Buzzstream Brandwatch HubSpot's Grader Suite Quirk's Search Status toolbar Check out some sample code and applications on the wiki. Our idea is that getting this data into the hands of webmasters makes everyone better off: we're excited about our new authority scores, marketers are thirsty for metrics, and users of all kinds of tools are better off with a deeper look at real data. The free package will keep you covered up to a million links per month that you're free to use for any purpose from consulting to building an SEO campaign management suite. In addition to the free API (which I think is quite powerful already), we're expanding our paid API offering. The paid API includes everything above, but also includes: Additional metrics: number of domains that link to you mozTrust number of links to all pages on your domain and more A deeper look at links, way beyond the first 500 (first 100k for each sort per page, domain or sub domain) Plenty of sorts on links: domain authority page authority linking root domains Way more anchor text terms and phrases (up to 100k per page, domain or sub domain if you've got that many) This is exactly the same API powering Open Site Explorer. So if you think OSE missed a feature, or should include other data sources, you can build it over again and do an even better job :) If you do, drop me a line and I'll take a look. We'd love to share partner apps on our wiki, Twitter, the blog, and elsewhere. We don't even have an attribution requirement. Although, we have a tasty 15% discount if you do cite us as a source ;) To sign up, just contact us, and we'll start the process. EDIT: The paid API is available outside of a PRO membership. A PRO membership buys the tools, and content, and sweet sweet badge. The paid API is extra. Of course, the free API is both free and full of awesome. Copied! Back to Top",
