Table of Contents Copied! By: Adam Feldstein October 1, 2015 At Last, You Can Now Add Users to Your Moz Pro Account! Moz Tools | Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Over the past few years, one feature has been requested more than any other. We call it Multiseat, which, at its core, is the ability for Moz Pro account owners to provide unique logins for their team members and/or clients. Multiseat support is something that we have prioritized, reprioritized, started, and restarted, and for a number of reasons (some good, some less good) we never quite got there. Well, I'm happy to announce that after a great collaborative engineering effort, it is finally here! We actually launched this feature quietly in August and have been monitoring usage and fixing issues to ensure Multiseat was ready for prime time before promoting it. So far hundreds of people are using it, and everything looks good! In this post I'm going to describe what Multiseat does, how to set it up, who gets access, and what improvements are on the horizon. What does Multiseat include today?This first version of Multiseat supports most of the core functions requested by customers. These include: You can set up unique logins for team members or clientsWith Multiseat, you can add anyone who has or creates a free Moz community profile to your account. Previously the only way to share access was to share your password, which was far from ideal and not a great practice from a security perspective. Multiseat can be useful in many scenarios: Providing access to members of your team Offering access to a client Inviting a consultant to come help with your campaigns Before Multiseat, if you were sharing your login, it was a pain to change and redistribute passwords if a team member left or a client engagement ended. Now that logins are separate from your core account, you can revoke access to someone who leaves and keep all of your other logins and passwords intact. Billing information is now kept private to the account ownerThis has been a common request, especially for larger organizations. Credit card and billing information is now kept private and is accessible only to the account owner. You can independently control which account emails you receiveIf your company has a lot of people managing a lot of campaigns, you may receive an awful lot of emails about data updates and completed reports, and for this email clutter I sincerely apologize. The good news is that each person with access to an account can now choose which campaigns to follow and thus limit emails from campaigns that aren't relevant. You can be a seat on multiple accountsWe've heard that some of you engage with multiple clients, each with their own Moz account. You now have the ability to be added to as many client accounts as you need to. For each account to which you have been granted access, you will be able to log in with your own Moz login and password. No more asking each client to give you their login information, and then trying to remember them all. Your Moz profile, community history and points will stay intact regardless of which accounts you've joined or leftAnother benefit of this update is the separation of community profiles from Moz Pro accounts. As a seat on one or more accounts, your MozPoints and interactions with the community can now follow you from engagement to engagement. Sweet! So how do I add new logins to my account?If you go to your account settings, you'll find a brand new tab called Manage Seats (http://moz.com/account). Once here, you will have the option to add one or more of your colleagues to your account. For more details on how to add seats check out this Q&A post. Who has access to Multiseat?All Moz Pro customers get access to Multiseat! Depending on your subscription level, you will have access to between 2 and an unlimited number of seats for your team to use. We packaged Multiseat into our existing subscriptions in a way that offers more seats for levels that are are more agency and team-focused. That said, we are not yet totally sure how customers will be using this feature, so we will learn and tune as we go forward. The current limits are as follows: Subscription Level No. of Seats Standard 2 Seats Medium 10 Seats Large 25 Seats Premium Unlimited Seats Enterprise Unlimited Seats What's next for Multiseat?While we've added a lot of new functionality with this release, there are still some important features that we haven't yet been able to get to. Most notably: Transfer of account ownershipThe next addition we know we need to make is the ability to transfer ownership of an account from one individual to another. Control over which campaigns a seat can accessFor v1, everyone can see all tools and campaigns. We've already received requests to allow the account owner to restrict individual logins so they can only see a subset of campaigns. Please send us feedback!This is just the start. We need your help to make this even better. Tell us what critical capabilities we are lacking. Tell us where we built things wrong. Tell us what is confusing. Now that we've launched this feature, we really want to make it work for you. Also, while I have your attention...I wanted to call out a few other updates that we've made this summer, just in case you missed them: Mobile RankingsNot only have we added Google mobile rankings to our capabilities, but we also gave everyone an extra search engine slot so that you can track mobile rankings for all of your existing campaign keywords without giving up any other search engine data you've been tracking. We also added tracking of Google's \"Mobile-friendly\" tag, so you can see which of the pages you rank for Google considers to be mobile-friendly. Learn more Search Visibility ScoresIt's been a challenge in the past to see how your rankings are trending across keywords. Search visibility represents the percentage of clicks we estimate that you get based on your ranking position(s) for the keywords you track. Filter by brand or any other tag you've added to see visibility for certain keywords sets, and compare your visibility against your competitors. Learn more On-Page Analysis workflow improvementsAfter a lot of good customer feedback, we rethought the on-page analysis feature workflow. Aside from a general facelift, we added the ability for customers to add keywords and pages to analyze and track, or to choose them from a list of suggestions that we update each week. Keep an eye out for some more significant improvements to this feature soon. Learn more You can now keep up with all of our new Moz Pro features and updates To help you find all of the new features and updates we make each week, we've added a What's New page that is accessible from any Moz Analytics campaign. Well, that's about it. Thanks for taking some time to read about our new updates, and as always, don't hesitate to let us know what we can do to make Moz better for you. Copied! Back to Top",
