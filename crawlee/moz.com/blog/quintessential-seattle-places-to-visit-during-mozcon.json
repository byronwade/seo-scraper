By: Erica McGillivray June 23, 2014 Quintessential Seattle Places to Visit During #MozCon 2014 SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. We're gearing up for all of you to land in Seattle for MozCon! It's just around the corner, July 14-16th, and as we do every year, we want to make sure you have a great time and get a chance to explore our city. (Or to just find a tasty place for dinner after a long day of learning.) If you haven't bought your ticket for MozCon, do it now! We're quickly selling the last few tickets, and are over 93+% sold out. Buy your ticket today, and sign up for a 30-day free trial to get your Moz Subscriber best deal. (If you cancel because Moz Pro isn't for you, we'll see you at MozCon regardless.) What is your quintessential Seattle place? This year, we asked Mozzers to name their quintessential Seattle place. They came up with a bunch of favorites, from breakfast spots to parks and more. Here's what they had to say: Dick's Drive-In Resturants \"Delicious hamburgers and fries. It's cash only, and there's almost always a line. How Seattle.\" - Joel Day Quinn's Pub \"The best burger north of Father's Office in Santa Monica and always a solid taplist.\" - David Mihm Editor's note: Quinn's Pub is also on our MozCrawl agenda. The Market Theater Gum Wall \"I'm based in Mozlandia, and I love coming to Seattle and experiencing this great city. Gum wall is a truly gross tourist trap—actually, careful, you could indeed get trapped—and in the heart of tourism central, Pike Place Market. Still there's a charm to such an offbeat (though heavily touristed) spot.\" - Peter Bray Pie Bar \"Pie Bar = pie + booze. An array of whiskies. Local and craft beers on tap. Fresh pies, both savory and sweet, made daily. If they would let me move in, I'd just live there.\" - Jess Stipe Black Bottle \"Ah-mazing food! Not bad for happy hour. Broccoli blasted - need I say more?\" - Stefanie Riehle Petit Toulouse \"Petit Toulouse in Queen Anne is the quintessential Seattle favorite when it comes to Cajun/Creole food. Petit Toulouse does not fail to impress every time I have been there. The atmosphere is superb and the food is out of this world. Additionally, I would recommend the buttermilk beignets after a good meal.\" La Bete \"I feel like it is the secret Cap Hill restaurant that only the neighborhood tends to frequent. The service is always great; the ambiance is always perfect for whatever occasion you are celebrating (romance, friendship, new boots, hunger); and it's a great place to sit at the bar, order a great glass of wine, and read by yourself. It's just good.\" - Leah C. Tyler Serious Pie \"This is the best pizza in the whole city. The community-style tables make for great conversation with strangers next to you. Great food, good beers. So fun.\" - Nicelle Herron Belltown Pizza \"If you're looking for pizza and are not into the odd California-style pizzas, this place has the best New York-style pizza in Seattle. Right off downtown, it's the first pizza joint I found in Seattle and is still the best IMHO.\" - Phil Hildebrand Kayaking on Lake Union \"You really get a feel for the Seattle landscape. Seeing the Space Needle, Gas Works Park, floating homes, wooden boats...all from a kayak on the water. Nothing better.\" - Jackie Immel Revel \"Some of the best food and drinks you'll find in the city (and that's saying a lot), and their patio in the summer is amazing.\" - Rand Fishkin Ballard Locks \"It's great to hang out in the sun and watch the boats go through the locks, plus the fish ladder is fun and free! The added bonus is that you're in Ballard so there are about fifty awesome breweries and bars at your fingertips.\" - Jamie Seefurth World Spice Market \"The proprietor here makes her own blends of spices, and everything is freshly ground or grind-at-home. Best spices. Try the Advieh - yum!\" - Lisa Wildwood Roux \"Matt Lewis of the Where Ya At Matt? food truck started a brick and mortar restaurant, and it is good. Very good. With a updated French Creole menu, he has taken it to the next level, and we locals love it. Keep in mind, it's a bit of a trek from downtown, but there is plenty to explore throughout the rest of Fremont making it well worth the trip.\" - Ben Simpson Pier 66 \"You can see the Space Needle, Puget Sound, Mt. Rainier (on a clear day), and the Great Wheel. Such an amazing view!\" - Chiaryn Miranda Staple & Fancy \"Fresh ingredients, dishes perfectly made, and an amazing chef's choice option.\" - Megan Singley Biscuit Bitch at Caffe Lieto \"Whether you need a pick-me-up in the morning or after some late night fun, Biscuit Bitch serves delicious Southern-style, with unique Seattle flare, biscuits and all the toppings you could want. I love their Bitchwitch sandwich. Just be prepared to eat it with a fork. They also have gluten-free options. Also make sure to use your favorite location check-in service and get a free sticker.\" - Erica McGillivray Looking for more options?
