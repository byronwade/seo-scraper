  "description": "It's been 10 amazing years since Rand started the blog that would turn into SEOmoz and then Moz, and we never could have come this far without you all. You'll find letters of appreciation from Rand and Sarah in this post (along with a super-cool video retrospective!), and from all of us at Moz,…",

Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin October 6, 2014 Thank You for 10 Incredible Years Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Below are letters written to you all (yes, you!) from both Rand and Sarah. The first is from Rand: Dear Moz Community, Wow. Ten years. It's been an incredible ride. Through the ups and downs (and there have been plenty of both), there haven't been many constants in my life—my wife, Seattle, and, strangely enough—you, the Moz community. From my first days on the blog and in the forums of the SEO world, when I was deeply in debt and had no idea how to dig my way out, to the incredible rush of 2007 and 2012 when we raised funding rounds and felt like the sky was the limit, you've been there. And in the darkest hours of the past decade, when I've felt the most alone, guilty, and insecure, you've been there, too. I get to see many of you in person—at conferences and events around the world. But I get to see you right here on the web, too—on Twitter, in the comments, through my email. Your support, empathy, and unwavering belief that Moz could and would do great things has been a beacon of hope and a challenge that I constantly strive to meet. A decade is a long time. Few things in our lives or in the world last that long—the average tech startup doesn't quite make two years. I'm honored and humbled that you've stuck with us all that time, and I promise that in the decade ahead, Moz will deliver more and better work in the areas you need most. We believe in making data that others hide transparent and accessible. We believe in delivering remarkable education and software that everyone can afford. We believe that all of this can be done not just without evil, but with real generosity of spirit and action. Thank you for the ten remarkable years of warmth, friendship, and support. We absolutely couldn't have done it without you, nor can we take the next steps without your help. I hope you'll keep holding us to high standards, and telling us when we've met your expectations and when we've let you down. With deep appreciation, Rand Fishkin Co-founder & individual contributor Moz The second letter is from Moz's CEO, and one of the company's earliest employees, Sarah Bird: Dear Moz Community, Moz is the steward of this community, but it's owned by everyone who contributes with posts, comments, shares, and visits. Many, many people have passed through the community, leaving an indelible mark. I get emotional remembering the humor and generosity of Goodnewscowboy. I'm grateful and relieved that Dana Lookadoo is still fighting the good fight. I'm STILL impressed with the solid that Rhea Drysdale did the SEO community when she fought a nasty trademark battle on the community's behalf. I salute all of the folks, and there have been many, who've been a force for good in my life and helped us all to take our game to the next level. Our community is dynamic, but always TAGFEE. In fact, I've come to believe it is the truest expression of TAGFEE. People share openly and without a promise of getting anything in return (TAG). It's a positive and supportive environment to become your best professional self (FEE). I'm proud that the Moz community is one of the few places on the web I'm not afraid to read the comments; I seek them out because they are consistently insightful and stimulating. Thank you to those who paused here for a bit before continuing on your journeys, and for those who have stuck with us. There are people out there RIGHT NOW who haven't yet discovered the Moz community, and who are going to help us keep it amazing in the future. I can't wait to meet them. Without all of you, there is nothing here. It's been 10 years, but there is still a lot to learn and a lot to teach. It still feels like day one. The pace of innovation has increased, and the stakes are higher. We strive to share, adapt, and become the most TAGFEE and impactful professionals we can be. Thank you for creating a space to do that every day. Together, we dig deeper and go farther than would be possible without each other. Let's keep it going and growing for the next ten years. Hugs and High Fives, Sarah Bird CEO Moz If you have any fun or interesting memories from the last 10 years, whether they're related to Moz, SEO, or whatever you think we might like to hear about (we're feeling awfully nostalgic), please share them in the comments below!
