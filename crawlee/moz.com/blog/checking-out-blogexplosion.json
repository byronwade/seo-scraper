By: Rand Fishkin November 21, 2005 Checking out BlogExplosion Online Advertising The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. BlogExplosion is a site that offers services, advice and software designed to increase blog traffic. I signed up tonight and have been checking out various services. There's a directory, a ping tool that you can add to your blog that lets you notify sites like technorati, newgator, feedster and syndic8 when you update your blog, and systems to measure traffic and referrals to your blog. There's even a knowledge base that's apparently just starting. BlogExplosion also has a credits system, whereby you earn credits by visiting other blogs and can then redeem them for traffic on your own blog or services like the rent my blog system. It's an interesting little community and one that's probably well worth investigating if your goal is to bring traffic to a high-quality blog. I'd venture a guess that a few hours a week spent there could translate into a few hundred extra visitors - a good investment for the small or mid-size business trying to build its readership.
