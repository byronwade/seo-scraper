Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin November 7, 2006 Share Your Sites Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. For this blog entry, I'd like to open up the comments to all of our members (and anyone out there who'd like to join in). Please share your websites - be they SEO-related blogs, niche e-commerce sites, AdSense-funded publishing sites, or anything else. Feel free to provide a brief intro if you'd like, or simply list the URL. Readers, including myself and the SEOmoz team, will do our best to take a quick visit to as many sites as possible - hopefully we'll find a few we love and can't live without. Maybe we'll provide a quick hint or suggestion, but at the least, it's an easy way to get some free website traffic, and a fun exercise to see what our readers are optimizing. p.s. Please don't share sites that are NSFW and remember that SEOmoz comments support the <a href=\"\"> tag, so you can use anchor text (though all comments are nofollowed). p.p.s. Yes, you can share multiple sites, but please don't go overboard with splogs or sites lacking in real content. UPDATE: Obviously, trying to visit and provide even quick comments is a massive undertaking. I'm doing my best, though, so please be patient. It would also help a ton if those who've submitted their sites would take a look at, review and provide insight for others. A little give-and-take is a great thing. Copied! Back to Top",
