JC Penney realizes something every SEO, social media marketer and viral content builder has known since they got into web marketing: People don't like being interrupted by marketing. So they provide content instead, hoping to earn a positive reaction and, in the future, a positive association with the male customer base watching Friday night sports.Penney likely spent ~$20,000 for 30 seconds of interruption 7 times (that I counted) during the 2 hours I'm on the couch drinking hot tea.I just hope they're spending $140,000 per channel per night on inbound, too, because when their customers want mens clothes, they do this:and see this:via @betsypavlicaand participate in this:via Metafilterand consume content like this:via PrimerI enjoyed the JC Penney ad.
