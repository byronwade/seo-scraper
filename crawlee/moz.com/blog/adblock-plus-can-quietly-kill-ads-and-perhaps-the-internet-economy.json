Q By: qismet September 21, 2007 AdBlock Plus can quietly kill ads - and perhaps the internet economy? User Experience (UX) This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I just came across an interesting article in the Guardian about a browser plugin that erases advertisements from web pages (even Adsense). I am now thinking: what happens when a model of advertising does not work? What ways will agencies think of to build brands and advertise online? If such a plugin became viral and widespread it would have an enormous impact on online advertising. The article refers to this being written about in the New York Times but I haven't actually checked to see if it's been on YOUmoz. Just very interested to hear other people views on this because, in my mind, it really increases the value of all that we do in SEO. Copied! Back to Top",
