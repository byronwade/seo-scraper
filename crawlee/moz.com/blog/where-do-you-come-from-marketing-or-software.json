By: Federico Caramella September 28, 2010 Where Do You Come From: Marketing or Software? Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Hello there. This is my first post on SEOmoz, I hope you'll find it interesting. It's about a thing that I've been thinking about last few days and I want to share it with you. I'm finishing my degree on System Engineering, and I'm more a systems analyst than a programmer, but no matter what I like most, I think that I'm far from Marketing. But here I am, on the best SEO blog :P. So I started to think about people who enter on the web positioning from the marketing industry. I really don't know why I'm attracted by a job that has a lot of things that I didn't study on my career, and lot of my partners don’t like much of the marketing stuff. So why web marketing? Well, as I mentioned, I'm not a programmer, so I don't like much to spend hours and hours writing code every day (but I still have to). Instead of that, I feel more comfortable talking with people, making some public relations, and most of all being analytic and solving problems. Apart from that I really like the challenges, and I love to learn about different problems or situations. So I started to pay attention to SEO, that brings me all this things and fast measurable results (more quick than being 2 years developing a system for a company). But suddenly I figured out that I have no knowledge on marketing. Never in all my years at the University did I learn a single thing about it! What a problem! But I still like what the SEO activity brings to me, although I had to learn a lot about how to persuade people on a sale. So my questions start at this point. I know people that work on web positioning that came from Marketing, but they don't know things about programming! No HTML, no PHP, some of them don't like computers at all! So why they are doing the same thing I do? Maybe the same interests like me, maybe the continuous challenges, I don't know. But I'm sure that they have to learn a lot of things too. Today there isn't a career that combines the two necessary ingredients for a SEO professional, so we have to learn many things on our own. But I know that in a little time this will change, this industry is growing up fast, and has an enormous potential. I come from Software, I'm still learning Marketing and I want to work in this mixture. And you, where do you came from? Copied! Back to Top",
