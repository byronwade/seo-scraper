By: Casey Henry November 4, 2009 What Makes a Link Worthy Post - Part 2 Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. What really makes a blog post worth linking to? In my last post, What Makes a Link Worthy Post - Part 1, I took a look at the 3,800 blog posts on SEOmoz and did some analysis on a few different aspects of the posts and their affect on the number of in linking domains (ILDs). Some of the results were very interesting to me and it made me want to push it further. I created a list of 40 SEO/SEM blogs that I read and feel are important to people in the industry and set those as my sample population. I first crawled each website and collected a list of over 72,330 different blog posts from the 40 different websites. Then over the course of the next few days, I crawled each post and collected the following information in my database: Blog Post Title Original URL # of Links from Root Domains (Via Linkscape API) # of ILDs (Via Linkscape API) If The Post Had Images, Lists, Or Videos Content of Post (No Comments or Other Text on Site) # of Words in Post POSTS TITLE EFFECT ON ILDs Does the length of the post’s title affect how many domains will link to it? The data suggests that posts with a title length between 10 and 18 words are on average more linked to than those with less or more. The data also suggests there may be a “sweet” spot around 14 to 16 words in length. The chart below was created without removing stop words. This data proves to me that a descriptive title is what the linkerati is looking for. Going overboard on the length of the title can prove to be a bad move also.

Google Brand Promotion: New Search Engine Rankings Place Heavy Emphasis on Branding What Makes a Good Web Directory, and Why Google Penalized Dozens of Bad Ones POSTS LENGTH EFFECT ON ILDs Post length is a long debated thing out there in the blogosphere. Most bloggers will tell you that you should keep your posts around 500 to 900 words, and that might be stretching it. When it comes to SEO/SEM blogs, longer more content filled posts are more linked to than those with limited amount of content. From the chart below you can see there is a word range that seems to collect more ILDs than other word ranges. Based on the data, the ideal length of your posts should be around 2328 to 2618 words. In my previous post, the ideal length for only SEOmoz’s post was between 1800 and 3000 words. The chart above shows posts only up to 2812 words, but accounts for over 99.55% of all the posts. Posts that were greater than 2812 words really had a low number of ILDs. For this reason and for the display of the chart, they were removed. EXAMPLES OF HIGHLY LINKED TO POSTS (BETWEEN 2328 AND 2618 WORDS) 101 Ways to Build Link Popularity SMX East: Give It Up Five Link Development Experts: A Group Interview DEPTH OF POSTS EFFECT ON ILDs Seos know that you want to keep your key content in as few subfolders as possible but does this affect the number of ILDs you receive? The data suggests that the depth of your post doesn't affect the number ILDs. The graph below shows that just about half of the blogs out there place their content two subfolders deep, such as seomoz.org/blog/POST-TITLE. MEDIA’S EFFECT ON ILDs What role does placing list, images, and/or videos in a post play on the number of ILDs? The data shows that putting any one of the media’s in your post will increase the number of ILDs you receive. Putting a list on your plain text post could double the number of ILDs you receive. The results are even more outstanding when all three types of media are used. Do I really believe that you can take any post, slap a picture in it and you will automatically receive more links? No, but if you have decent content and media to support your post, it will appeal to more users and in turn increase the number of potential links. I find it amazing that just by adding images and lists to your post could increase the number of ILDs by a large percent. Images and lists are one of the easiest things to create and anyone can do it, so why aren’t they? See the chart below for the full specs on adding media to your post. TOP MEDIA POST EXAMPLES So I’m sure you are all wondering what some good examples are of the different type of post along with the media. Below are some links to some great posts that contain different types of media and have been successful. Some of these posts should be your guide when creating new content for your site.

Below I’ve put together two sites for each category so if you enjoy posts of a certain type you can visit their blog.

Seems like a simple question and the data seems to show that if your an authority in your niche, you will generate many more ILDs than someone who is not. Look at the chart below and you can see that Matt Cutt’s blog generates almost twice as many as its closest competitor, sugarrae.com! TOP TOPIC THAT ATTRACT LINKS Unlike SEOmoz not every blog places their post into nice categories and if they do, those categories will not match across all the sites. So how do we determine what topics are attracting the most links and are good topics to create posts about? We crawl 72,300 posts, determine the ILDs, and then extract the most used words from those posts to create a “super” group of keywords that result in link worthy blog posts. The first thing I wanted to do was extract all the text and find the words that are most used in all blog posts, I was curious, aren’t you? After pulling out 27,658,728 million words and sorting them, five words came out on top: Search, Google, Yahoo, Site, and SEO. Was I surprised, no but it’s interesting to know and a good starting point. Taking a look at the top 1% of all 72,330 posts, it was found that the words did change a little bit. Some of the top words used were: Search, Google, Site, Links, SEO, Content, People, and Social. This data seems very similar to what was found in part one of this study, with the SEOmoz data. Posts that are about link building are very popular but now we can conclude that they are attracting links. When we look at a much smaller percentage say only the top 50 posts, you find that you are getting very similar words such as: Google, Search, Blog, Link, Pagerank, and Site. So what can you really take away from the content of the top 50 blog posts? Stick with the major engines: Google, Yahoo, and maybe even Bing, on a good day. The linkerati likes topics including Link Building, Pagerank, and Social Media. As my disclaimer stated above, these are not the rules but just observations from a small sampling of the blogosphere. If I knew the exact topic that the linkerati loves, I wouldn’t be writing here, I would be out making millions writing all day. BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS The data suggests that posts with title between 14 and 16 words attract more ILDs than those with longer or shorter titles. Contrary to belief, the data suggests that posts with more than 900 words are attracting more links than those with 900 words. Shoot for post between 2328 and 2618 words. The data suggest the location/depth of your blog post doesn’t seem to have an effect on the number of ILDs you will receive but may affect your SEO work, so be cautious. If you’re interested in the top post with a certain type of media, check above. Also if you’re interested in the blogs that tailor to a certain type of media, check above. Authority plays a major role in the number of ILDs that you will receive on your post. Matt Cutt’s blog receives twice as many ILDs as the next closest blog. Hot topics that attract links include: Google, Search, Blogs, Link Building, Pagerank, SEO, and Social Media. SUMMARY In summary, the takeaways above are generalization about a small group of post from the blogosphere and should not be taken as rules but merely as a guide to help you create content that will have the possibility to generate links. Work on the authority in your niche and become that place people come to receive great advise. While you’re waiting for authority to grow, make sure that your posts included visual aids to help readers get the takeaways quickly.
