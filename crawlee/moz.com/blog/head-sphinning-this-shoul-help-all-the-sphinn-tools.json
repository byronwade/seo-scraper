This Should Help: All The Sphinn Tools Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. If you haven't heard of Sphinn by now, there is a good chance that you've spent the last couple of weeks in a black hole. But whilst the new site is generating a lot of buzz, it could be said that it's also been getting a bit confusing. Why? Because every man and his dog have released Sphinn widgets, or feed flares, or something. So I've collected all the ones that I could find right here and, if the lovely Mozzers will let me, will update this page periodically with any new ones that come along. Add Sphinn to Share This Wordpress plugin Add Sphinn It to Blogger templates A Sphinn button for any blog Sphinn bookmarklet, for easy Sphinning Sphinn dashboard widget for Macs Sphinn It Button for Wordpress Adding Spinn to Sociable Wordpress blog Customisable Sphinn button for Wordpress Sphinn It FeedFlare for FeedBurner 'Smart' Sphinn It FeedFlare with Vote Counts That's all I could find right now, but I'm sure there will be more. Feel free to post them in the comments, and of course, to Sphinn this article (if Rebecca is nice enough to give this post its own button)! I'm the SEO Director at British full service digital agency Altogether Digital. Here's our current blog whilst we work on our new site. We came up with the Sociable Sphinn It plugin & hope that you like it. Copied! Back to Top",
