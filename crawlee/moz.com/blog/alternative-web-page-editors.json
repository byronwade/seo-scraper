By: Rand Fishkin October 11, 2005 Alternative Web Page Editors Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I've noticed Bluefish getting a lot of attention lately, particularly in light of Adobe's acquisition of Macromedia and the proposed combination of the two most popular editors in the marketplace today - Dreamweaver (which I've used for 5+ years) and GoLive (which I tried several years ago and thought was horrible). I'm actually loathe to give up Dreamweaver, particularly due to the great plug-ins for the PHP packages that let me add code for dynamic pages that I couldn't normally do without help from my programming staff (I've always been more of the \"idea\" guy). Bluefish looks intriguing though and it would be nice to move to an open-source editor. The possibilities for add-ons to these types of projects multiply exponentially with the community growth around them. I won't be switching until they come out with a graphical editor, but I see that right around the corner. Copied! Back to Top",
