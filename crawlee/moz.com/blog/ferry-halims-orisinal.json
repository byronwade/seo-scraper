Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin January 5, 2006 Ferry Halim's Orisinal Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. No relation to SEO whatsoever, but Ferry Halim, a graphic and Flash game designer whose work astounds me has put together what is, in my opinion, his most addictive game yet. If you've never been to Orisinal, get ready to spend the rest of the day playing some timelessly fun and impressively slick mini-games.
