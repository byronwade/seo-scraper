By: Rand Fishkin May 9, 2005 What a Good Link Request E-Mail Looks Like Link Building The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I got the e-mail I've copied below today. It's probably the best link request example I've ever gotten. Even after realizing that it was probably an auto-generated and mass-sent e-mail, I considered responding to let him know I appreciated the kind words. People are always asking how to phrase their link request letters, so here's a sample: Hi, Nate here from the Veteran's Loan Center and I wanted to drop you line and just compliment your site. Nice layout, good info, good resources. I was looking around at a few different sites for realty information and I definitely thought your's was one of the best. That being said, I also noticed you guys have some great content related to homes. I currently work for a company that maintains a website that offers home financing, www.veteranloancenter.com. We are a nationally recognized, reliable source for VA loans on the web and I was wondering if you'd be interested in us paying to advertise via text links on your site. I realize that there are sometimes set rates/fees involved in such placement of text links so feel free to name your price.If not, thanks for the time and keep up the good work!Thanks,NateNot bad, eh?
