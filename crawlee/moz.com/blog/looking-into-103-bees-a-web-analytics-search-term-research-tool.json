By: Rand Fishkin July 25, 2006 Looking Into 103 Bees - A Web Analytics & Search Term Research Tool SEO Tools The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. On top of del.icio.us/popular today is - 103bees Search Term Analytics, a tool that claims to help: Explore your Long Tail of search and learn about all keyword combinations that actually work for your pages Find out what keywords to use in optimized new content to attract more visitors Get a quick traffic overview to monitor whether your search engine optimization efforts pay off The screenshots are small and hard to understand, and the descriptive text itself is sadly vague as well. The great number of bookmarks also made me suspicious, but I couldn't find any pattern among those who tagged it at del.icio.us, so it may well be legitimate (although typically, you don't see this many positive and praiseful comments - taggers are more likely than not to simply give a short 2-3 word description or use nothing at all). Luckily, it's been reviewed by Markus Merz at Performancing, who detailed the features: The main menu is \"Analyze projects\" which will give you the following items after choosing the individual domain to look at: Latest search terms - This will show the latest search phrase and the follow-up analysis for the landing page and the search engines which triggered that landing page. Links for every single search phrase are 'Pages' and 'Engines. Top landing pages - This will show the landing pages with the most search engine traffic in the chosen time-frame (7 or 30 days). Follow-Up analysis shows an individual traffic graph for that landing page and (!) which search engine phases lead to that landing page (very, very interesting). Links for every landing page are 'Traffic' and 'Phrases'. Top search terms - Search terms ordered by most traffic. The rest is like 'Latest search terms'. Top keywords - Single (!) keywords ordered by generated traffic. The keywords are presented as list or cloud. Both presentations show the most used keywords which generated traffic for that individual project (domain) for the given time-frame (7 or 30 days) or a maximum of 5.000 search hits. The follow-up analysis in the list view allows to check for related keywords and to get a list of the phrases where that single keyword showed up (very, very interesting). Here you can define stop-words which will not show up in that list anymore. Search engines - The typical list of search engines but you can see absolute numbers and percentage. It's probably worth a test install, although, for some inexplicable reason, there's no indication of how the testing service or the pricing works on the site itself. Though they may be great designers of analytics programs, their user experience credentials for their own site are seriously suspect... Anyone have any experience with this software (preferrably someone who doesn't work for them)? Copied! Back to Top",
