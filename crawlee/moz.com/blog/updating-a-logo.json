By: Rand Fishkin January 14, 2006 Updating a Logo Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I noticed a highly linked-to post on Fizbang web design that covered how to re-touch and update a logo. Interestingly enough, Matt just re-made the logo for SEOmoz (for our new business cards and new website - on its way). Check out a walkthrough: Here's our old logo, which shows why SEOs shouldn't be logo designers. The colors work, but there's not sparkle to the SEOmoz \"flower\" - it's a bit boring and the curve on the box surrounding it is a bit off. Let's see what Matt's done: The updates are subtle, but the overall effect is terrific (IMO). The gradient background gives it a very polished look and the bigger flower to text ratio size helps to brand the icon as being important in the logo. I also like the drop-shadowing on the internal star and the border box. The impression I get from the new logo is that of a more professional and design-oriented firm - certainly a positive image to convey in this industry. Two questions for discussion/posting: Any logos that stand out to you in the SEO/M space? Anyone else re-design their logo lately? Copied! Back to Top",
