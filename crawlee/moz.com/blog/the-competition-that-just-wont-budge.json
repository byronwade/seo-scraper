By: Rand Fishkin August 28, 2007 The Competition that Just Won't Budge Mobile SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. You know the feeling... That competitor who, no matter what you do, always ranks above your site. You've got more links, better links, better optimization, more targeted anchor text, tons of better viral content and yet, somehow, as though blessed by a higher power, your site simply can't outrank that @#$%! I'd like to do something a little different on the SEOmoz blog today, and ask you to share - share your ranking nightmare. Share the search term and the website that you just can't figure out. If you've been pulling out your hair and screaming at the search engines, today's your chance to offer up your struggle and get some help from your fellow SEOmoz readers (and us mozzers, too). Obviously, I don't actually hate HouseValues.com - I'm just pandering to a friend (exhibit a). Over the next few days, we'll hopefully take a more detailed look at some of the sites and SERPs you share and try to puzzle out what's helping them ruin your otherwise blissful existence :) Copied!
