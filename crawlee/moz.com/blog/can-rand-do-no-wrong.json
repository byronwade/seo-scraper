Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I've been watching this community now for a few months since I've joined, thumbing up what I think is good and thumbing down things that I don't. For the most part posts are well thought out, well written and well received. Admittedly, I've thumbed up way more than I've thumbed down - I like you guys :) I've also watched the opinions of different members and the amount of negative reviews they're willing to dish out, regardless of reputation or opinion towards other heavily participating members. Within that ilk we're very honest about the quality of the content being shared. There is a liberal amount of thumbing down and a fair amount of opposing discussion within a variety of posts, which I think is good for growth and healthy discussion. However, regarding the posts of the official Mozzer – i.e., the man himself, Mr. Fishkin - we tend to bridle our thoughts and turn down the heat a bit. Why so? If I’m to be honest, which I strive to be, I’ve seen better posts from members that receive negative reviews. Not to discredit Rand, he knows his S%#@! – and I’ve yet to thumb him down (I’m part of the problem too). Fellow Mozzers, I ask you; can it be that Rand can do no wrong? Is it because: He’s the man of the house? We want him to like us? We need a job? He can squash you like a bug? We’re afraid…of Rebecca He’s just that good (and he can squash us like a bug) What’s the deal? When did we allow our desire to reach the top of the member list to stop at Rand’s feet? If he was just a member, would you \"Boo\" him then? I say, \"Time for a Litmus test!\" Rand, it's time to create a fictitious screen name, post your ideas and let the anonymity of this said member name to allow us part-timers to crack on you a bit. Whadda' ya say? All in good fun. (I realize I'm about to be squashed like a bug, but I had to write this.) Copied! Back to Top",
