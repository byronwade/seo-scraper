By: Cyrus Shepard October 9, 2019 Announcing Quick, Free SEO Metrics with a New Domain Analysis Tool Moz Tools | SEO Analytics | Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. If you want a quick overview of top SEO metrics for any domain, today we're officially launching a new free tool for you: Domain SEO Analysis. One thing Moz does extremely well is SEO data: data that consistently sets industry standards and is respected both for its size (35 trillion links, 500 million keyword corpus) and its accuracy. We're talking things like Domain Authority, Spam Score, Keyword Difficulty, and more, which are used by tens of thousands of SEOs across the globe. With Domain Analysis, we wanted to combine this data in one place, and quickly show it to people without the need of creating a login or signing up for an account. The tool is free, and showcases a preview of many top SEO metrics in one place, including: Domain AuthorityLinking Root Domains# of Ranking KeywordsSpam ScoreTop PagesTop Linking DomainsDiscovered and Lost LinksKeywords by Estimated Clicks (new)Top Ranking KeywordsTop Featured Snippets (new)Top Branded Keywords (new)Keyword Ranking DistributionTop Search Competitors (new)Top Search Questions (new) Many of these metrics are previews that you can explore more in-depth using Moz tools such as Link Explorer and Keyword Explorer. New experimental metrics Domain Analysis includes a number of new, experimental metrics not available anywhere else. These are metrics developed by our search scientist Dr. Pete Meyers that we're interested in exploring because we believe they are useful to SEO. Those metrics include: Keywords by Estimated Clicks You know your competitor ranks #1 for a keyword, but how many clicks does that generate for them? Keywords by Estimate Clicks uses ranking position, search volume, and estimated click-through rate (CTR) to estimate just how many clicks each keyword generates for that website. Top Featured Snippets Search results with featured snippets can be very different than those without, as whoever \"wins\" the featured snippet at position zero can expect outsized clicks and attention. These are potentially valuable keywords. Top Featured Snippets tells you which keywords a site ranks for that triggers a featured snippet, and also whether or not that site owns the snippet. Branded Keywords Branded keywords are a type of navigational query in which users are searching for a particular site. These can be some of the website's most valuable keywords. Typically, it's very hard — for anyone outside of Google — to accurately know what a site's branded keywords actually are. Using some nifty computations in our database, here you'll find the highest volume keywords reflecting the site's brand. Cool, right? Top Search Competitors Knowing who your top search competitors are is important for any serious SEO competitive analysis. Sadly, most people simply guess. You may know who competes for your favorite keyword, but what happens when you rank for hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of keywords? Fortunately, we can comb through our vast database and make these calculations for you. Top Search Competitors shows you the competitors that compete for the same keywords as this domain, ranked by visibility. Top Questions \"People Also Ask\" have become a ubiquitous feature of Google search results, and represent a good starting point for keyword research and topic optimization. Top Questions shows questions mined from People Also Ask boxes for relevant keywords.
