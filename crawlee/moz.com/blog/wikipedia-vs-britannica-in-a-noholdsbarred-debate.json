By: Rebecca Kelley September 12, 2006 Wikipedia vs. Britannica in a No-Holds-Barred Debate Social Media The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The Wall Street Journal online hosted a debate between Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and Dale Hoiberg, the editor-in-chief of Encyclopaedia Britannica. I've included a brief excerpt (in which Jimmy Wales lays the smackdown on Dale Hoiberg) below:Mr. Hoiberg: No, we don't publish rough drafts. We want our articles to be correct before they are published. We stand behind our process, based on trained editors and fact-checkers, more than 4,000 experts, and sound writing. Our model works well. Wikipedia is very different, but nothing in their model suggests we should change what we do.Mr. Wales: Fitting words for an epitaph…The debate makes for a very interesting read. Wikipedia's popularity has certainly left a sour taste in Britannica's mouth. What do you all think of the debate? Is there a clear winner? Does Britannica look musty and fuddy-duddy in the era of user-generated content? Or is Wikipedia striking out while at bat in the big leagues? Have you gotten sick of my metaphors yet? Copied!
