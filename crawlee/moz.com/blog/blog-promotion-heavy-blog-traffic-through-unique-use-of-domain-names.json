Kearse June 3, 2008 Blog Promotion: Heavy Blog Traffic Through Unique Use of Domain Names Online Advertising This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Could you benefit from heavy traffic to a money making page on your web site or blog? How about heavy traffic to a list building lead capture page? Here's how to provoke heavy traffic to either or both of the above in 3 simple steps. Choose a domain name that's humorous or provokes curiosity Re-direct that domain name traffic to any URL you choose Use the new domain name in forum posts, forum signatures, blog comments, and email signatures =>=>=> (1) You want to buy a domain name for the express purpose of re-directing traffic to a specific blog or web site page. So, you will come up with a domain name that is closely related to the theme of the page you are promoting. Let's say you have a professional wrestling blog. You have written a post,\"Famous Wrestling Techniques That Result In A Win.\" Use HUMOR or CURIOSITY in your domain name. IRefuseToDateAnyWomanWhoHasMasteredThisWrestlingTechnique.com OR TheSecretWrestlingTechniqueThatInducesUltimatePain.com These are just examples of two choices that might induce a laugh or curiosity and provoke the reader to click the link (the above domains would be hyperlinked in actual practice). You can: Choose the domain name first and then write posts that have a strong thematic relationship to your chosen domain OR Select a domain name to re-direct to an existing blog post or web page. The domain name should be closely related to the page that receives the traffic. The main benefit is for you to understand the concepts involved and adapt them to whatever is the theme of your blog/site. Bounce your domain name possibilities off of friends who have the same interests. You probably can come up with some outrageous, relevant domain names. (2) Use the free re-direct service of your domain registrar. I use MyDomain.com for my domain names. They provide a free re-direction service for domain names (not just ones purchased there). You will need DNS info from your hosting company to put the re-direction in place. You can change the re-direction at any time. Most domain name companies will provide this re-direction service. (3) Use your chosen domain name in forum posts, as a forum signature, in your email signature, and in blog comments. When you make a forum post that adds meaningful content to the discussion, and it is appropriate to refer in the post to your blog/web site, then that is the time to use your new domain name. Be sure to capitalize each word in the domain name for maximum click-thrus (this has been split tested). Some forums may prohibit URLs that re-direct in posts. Another option is to simply use the new domain name as your forum signature. Some forums permit multiple links in the signature box. Your email signature may be a good place to use your new domain name, depending on its theme. You decide. Finally, making blog comments on other blogs provides a super opportunity for promoting traffic to your chosen site. You do not even have to refer to your site in the post. Substitute your domain URL where your name would be. Sign the comment itself with your full name. The blog comment must be closely related to your domain name which receives the traffic. Don't make a comment on a cooking blog and use your wrestling domain name. Also, some blog owners may regard using the domain URL in place of your name as spam, but most will not if the domain name is related in theme to the post being commented on. If you make a meaningful and helpful blog comment, you should get a very high click-thru rate on your domain name. Best of success. Copied! Back to Top",
