By: Rand Fishkin April 12, 2006 Money Magazine's Top 50 Jobs & SEO Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Another short post due to my slow typing. Money magazine put out their list of the top 50 jobs and while SEO isn't on there per se, I think we can make some assumptions and slide onto the list. The job of SEO combines, in my opinion, the following: Market Research Analyst (#6 on the list) Computer/IT Analyst (#7 on the list) Advertising Manager (#11 on the list) Technical Writer (#13 on the list) Public Relations Specialist (#20 on the list) Thus, we should be ranked somewhere between #9-14, although I'd (personally) much rather be an SEO than any of the jobs they list (with the possible exception of writer, but I'm kinda that, too). Anyone else want to be an SEO when they grow up? Copied! Back to Top",
