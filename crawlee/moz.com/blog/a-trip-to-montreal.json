Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin July 6, 2006 A Trip to Montreal Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Sure, the post is a bit off-topic, but I figure if Mike Grehan can write about falling in love with cities, why not SEOmoz? This was my first trip to Montreal, and my first experience with Quebec. Luckily, I didn't have to rely on my non-existant French as much as I'd feared, as the city is completely bilingual - though reading the English in the small, paraenthetical portion of each label/sign/display sent the clear message of which culture was in charge. Thank goodness, too, as the English really can't cook, and food was one of the primary focuses of the trip. I was lucky enough to be able to bring my girlfriend with me, and together with fellow SEOmoz blogger and native Montrealer, Guillaume Bouchard (of NVI) and his stunning girlfriend, we got to see a lot of the city. We visited the Jean Talon open market Got bagels on St. Viateur And ate at the famous Au Pied du Cochon (literally - the foot of the pig) restaurant (where I tried poutine for the first time, along with fresh seafood and lots of foie gras) Montreal is fascinatingly seductive. With thousands of underground stores connected by tunnels (presumably to help dodge the brutally cold and snowy winters), a metro system that was clean and efficient, stunning views of old and new at every corner, and a penchant for enchanting visitors via the tongue and stomach, I couldn't ask for anything more. On the business side of things, I'm pleased to say that Guillaume and I will be working together on a still-secret project. It's great to work with friends, and just as eye-opening to be exposed to working with different cultures and languages. The speed of business and commerce in Montreal is at break-neck speed - surprising for what is generally thought of as the most European city in North America. Having just returned from a few weeks in Europe, I'm not entirely sure if the moniker fits, but I am sure that my love affair with Montreal is just beginning. Copied! Back to Top",
