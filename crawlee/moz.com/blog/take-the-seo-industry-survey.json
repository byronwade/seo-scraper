By: Rebecca Kelley January 29, 2008 Take the SEO Industry Survey Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Note from Jeff: I'd like to apologize to those of you who took the survey within the first few minutes of release. Since we released the blog post and sent out an email to our members, we've received a very quick & fast influx of traffic all at once - much higher than normal. We analyzed the problem, made some changes to our web server configuration, and are should be running much better now - albeit a tad slow. If you have any issues, however, please feel free to contact me. More from Jeff: Just letting everyone know I've added a link on \"Recording your response...\" page to let you retry to submit your response if it is taking too long. It was a change in the javascript file, so you may have to do a shift+refresh to see the update. We have previously mentioned a few times on our blog that we were working on an SEO survey, and I'm pleased to say that today we're ready to launch it. Behold, the SEO Industry Survey in all its green-hued glory! The purpose of the survey is to collect anonymous information about search marketers, which we will aggregate and publicly share with the search community. The survey is 51 questions long, and upon completion you will be entered in a drawing to win an iPhone (or a $400 gift certificate to Amazon.com if you already own an iPhone). The more completed surveys we get, the better our data will be, meaning our findings will be of greater interest to the search community. Be sure to take the survey! All of your information will remain anonymous, and once we receive enough responses, we'll announce when we'll publish the data. Copied! Back to Top",
