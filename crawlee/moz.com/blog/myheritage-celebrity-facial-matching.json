By: Rand Fishkin March 12, 2006 MyHeritage Celebrity Facial Matching Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Just wanted to point out MyHeritage.com's facial recognition and matching software, which has given my girlfriend quite a thrill. It seems that I'm a 51% facial match to Cary Grant - she's glowing right now. I'm actually relatively amazed at the ability of the software to identify features and match them up. Supposedly, this technology will soon be applied to your personal photo libraries (MyHeritage is currently still in beta) and can be used to categorize photos by the identities you assign (once) to a face. Damn cool stuff. p,s, My closest match was actually Rowan Atkinson, but we'll ignore that piece and focus on the positives, eh? Copied! Back to Top",
