Lots and lots of coffee and craft brews. That's why a few Mozzers have pulled together their favorite places to check out during your stay in the Emerald City. No Anchor“By far my favorite place in Belltown. Incredibly unique beer selection and fresh local food combinations that you can’t find anywhere else.”– Abe SchmidtMarination Ma Kai“Marination is one of the top food trucks in the country and now they have several brick and mortar restaurants. Marination Ma Kai is located in West Seattle and has a big outdoor patio with gorgeous views of downtown Seattle, it's a summer hotspot for a cool beverage and noms. Why is it quintessential Seattle? Not only is the food life changing, the view amazing, but getting there is an adventure! Just walk down to the waterfront and hop on the wonderful Seattle Water Taxi. The trip from downtown drops riders off right at the restaurant.” Rapha Seattle“If you LOVE bicycles this place is a must-visit. One of only five US Rapha Clubhouses, Rapha Seattle is home to delicious coffee, fine food, and bicycle events. The atmosphere is cool and inviting. Visitors are surrounded by the coolest bicycle gear and memorabilia. You can rent a Canyon bicycle to explore the city (Which is a big deal because you cannot buy Canyon bikes in America, yet). Rapha also does guided bike rides for the public and member only rides.”– James Daugherty Taylor Shellfish (Pioneer Square, Capitol Hill, or Queen Anne)“The Puget Sound offers the best oysters in the world. What's great about Taylor Shellfish is that it's all about the oysters, the drinks and the people you're with in a simple, unpretentious, come-as-you-are atmosphere. There's nothing more quintessential to Seattle than that.” The Point in Burien“An all-around great bar to grab a bite and a drink if your flight is delayed or you need to kill some time near the airport. The Point is 10 minutes from SeaTac, has a fantastic menu (including lots of gluten free options), a great cocktail menu, tap list, and big-screen TVs.”– Brittani Dinsmore Hattie’s Hat“Ballard was an old fishing village. Hattie's Hat bar has been in continuous operation for over 100 years and the bar that you sit at was installed in 1907 or something. Incredible. The bartenders are all in Seattle bands, some of them moderately famous from the 1990s. Go in the early afternoon. Ask for Lupe or Lara. Sit at the bar. You'll thank me for it.“– Brian Childs Holy Mountain Brewery“Seattle is a beer city. Holy Mountain makes Seattle's best beer. Go there.”– Evelyn Baek The Whale Wins, Revel, Joule, and Fremont Brewing“All are in the Fremont area and are each tasty in their own right. Besides if you don't like those options there are plenty of places to choose from in Fremont”– Steve Manjarrez Ada’s Technical Books and Cafe\"Coffee + super sleek bookstore that encourages women in tech and science. Need I say more?\"– Meredith Crandell Still hungry?
