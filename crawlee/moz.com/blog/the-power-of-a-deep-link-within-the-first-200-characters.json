I By: IgorMordkovich February 15, 2007 The Power of a Deep Link Within The First 200 Characters Link Building This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Not many people realize the power of deep linking into your own site within the first paragraph of your blog post, article, PR release, etc. No, this is not suggested because Google might give more value to links higher within the content. It’s simpler. Whenever your “content” is republished somewhere … many times you’ll notice that the website will show a brief intro to content (usually your first paragraph) and then offer a link to read further. Well, isn’t it nice when your deep links are right there on top, closer to the index page, visible not only to people who read the article but also to search engine’s spiders? My only suggestion is … keep it natural. Copied! Back to Top",
