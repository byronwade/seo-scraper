Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin December 12, 2005 Recognizing my Team Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. One of the most dissapointing features to the Newsweek article is that, despite my pleading, the editors chose not to feature any of the photos which included Matt & Kat - nor were they mentioned in the article, prompting Matt's mom to exclaim - \"you got robbed!\" Indeed they did, and, although it's a small condolence prize, I've got a leftover polaroid used by Gabriela (our photographer) to measure light levels, that can serve as slight recognition: Left to right: Gillian Muessig, Rand Fishkin, Matt Inman & Kat Ortland Their individual efforts are worthy of at least the attention given to me by Newsweek. Gillian - Along with being my mom, she's also the founder of the company, and had been doing print and identity design work, as well as branding and advertising consulting, since I was born. Not too shabby for a lady raising three kids. Today, she manages the financial, administrative and client relations of our firm with exceptional skill. Matt - Matt joined us in 2003 and is responsible for the design, development, programming and hosting of our clients' sites. His amazing work is also being used for SEO - he's building a new suite of SEO tools right now (in addition to managing the technical side of at least a half dozen other websites). His first prototype is the newly re-built keyword difficulty tool (note the GUI and functionality improvements). Kat - Kat joined us literally the day of the photoshoot, but has fit in perfectly. She's repsonsible for several SEM campaigns right now, in addition to managing ad buys for our clients and starting on some link building campaigns. In fact, it was her recent efforts that have boosted Avatarfinancial.com (mentioned in the article) back up since Jagger. Without great people behind me, there would be no company. I couldn't operate this business or experience success without them. I wish everyone the luck I've had in finding co-workers like these - dedicated, intelligent, capable and willing. Thanks gang.
