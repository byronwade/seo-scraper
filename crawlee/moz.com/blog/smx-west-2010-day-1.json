By: Jennifer Sable Lopez March 3, 2010 Ballmer, Sitelinks & Other Favorites from SMX West Day 1 SEO Events The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. SMX West 2010 kicked off with quite a bang (or was that a yell?). Since Microsoft's CEO, Steve Ballmer was the keynote, people arrived early to ensure good seats. The music playing before it started was amazing, it helped to create an excitement in the room that I really had never felt before a keynote before. I had attempted to save a seat for someone up front, but there was just too much demand and had to give it up. That's the sort of thing that happens at a great concert, not a conference keynote. There were quite a few live blogs of the event, but I had a few favorites from the interview that I wanted to call out. He made it very clear that Microsoft is focused on the big picture and not just immediate goals. He spoke about continuing to move forward with a positive momentum and a differentiated point of view. When the question came up of \"Can you be #1 in the U.S.?\" he essentially said \"YES!\" [and yes he said it with that exclamation] However he made it clear that it was a tricky question. If you say yes, you sound arrogant but if you say no you sound unsure of yourself. You don't do things to come in second! Danny asked \"Is Yahoo! going to survive as a search player? You want to beat them aren't you just going to kill them?\" Ballmer could really only answer one way \"No.\" He stated that they wanted Yahoo! to do a good job, that there was lots of flexibility written into their contract and there was advantage to having the power of 2 as opposed to the power of 1. When asked whether he was going to get on Twitter he said \"I'm more of a webpage than a bunch of short tweets.\" But then acknowledged that he did have a stealth Twitter account however only the people in his neighborhood followed him. His favorite thing on Bing are the Bing maps. [completely agree here... the maps are amazing!] What he thinks is the biggest opportunity in search: to \"Help people get done what they're trying to get done.\" Oh! And he gave us all his personal email account. You'll have to watch the video to get that though. :) All in all it was quite enjoyable to watch, although I was a bit unprepared (although perhaps I shouldn't have been) for the yelling. Ok, I don't think in his mind he was yelling, he was just talking VERY LOUDLY. But sitting right up front, I think we all sat back in our chairs a bit when he got excited and started to get louder. :) You can see the full video of the keynote below. I'd love to hear your impression of the interview. Do you feel that anything was said that gave away any secrets? What are your thoughts? &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br/&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;http://www.bing.com/videos/watch/video/steve-ballmer-smx-west-keynote-conversation-with-danny-sullivan/1280gxwnj?fg=sharenoembed&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; _fcksavedurl=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;http://www.bing.com/videos/watch/video/steve-ballmer-smx-west-keynote-conversation-with-danny-sullivan/1280gxwnj?fg=sharenoembed&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; target=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;_new&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;title=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Steve Ballmer SMX West Keynote Conversation with Danny Sullivan&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Video: Steve Ballmer SMX West Keynote Conversation with Danny Sullivan&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Google’s Personalized Search Revolution Now that personalization has become an opt-out rather than an opt-in, I was really interested in what this session had to offer. The only speaker, Brian Horling who works in Personalized Search at Google, first gave a very informative presentation, then fielded quite a few questions from the audience. I really enjoyed having just one speaker who was focused on the topic at hand. The top takeaways that I got were some of the differences between a logged out user who gets personalized search versus a logged in user. Let me break it down a bit. First of all, both types of users are thought of as two different identities to Google. Let's say you're logged in, and then log out, they don't view you as the same logged in person. At that point they do look at the cookies set on your computer which tell gives them information on what you've searched for previously, which results you've clicked on, etc. For signed in accounts, your web history is saved indefinitely, but your non-logged in identity is only saved for 180 days. Every user using search has the potential of seeing personalized search in some way whether it's geo-location, web history, social search, etc. Personalization occurs about 1 in 5 queries for a user and the changes tend to be restricted to only a few results. How can you control the personalization of your searches? Use search details Disable it by appending &pws=0 on searchs (you can find the bookmarklet to do that here) Edit or disable your web history If you haven't looked at the \"view customizations\" link I highlight above before, you should definitely check it out. Pretty interesting what's going on there. One thing that came up in this session was how do you explain to a client that the results they're seeing aren't the same as what everyone else sees. Although in some cases that would probably be a good thing since they're seeing better rankings since they search and click on their sites more often than the average user. :) How do you feel about personalized search? After this presentation I found that I was much more open to the idea than I was previously. I think because I felt like I finally understood a bit better where the data was coming from and how to turn it off. But what about you? And so on... The other session I really loved was \"Supercharging Your Descriptions With Sitelinks\" but as I was putting this post together I realized that should really a be a post in and of itself. It was great to hear from a Google rep about how certain sitelinks show up and ways you can enhance your site to ensure proper sitelinks. I have tons of screenshots and examples, so I'll put them into a full post. Plus I'd really like to get Jerry Dischler (the Google guy) to answer a few of my questions. :) So watch for that one! The best swag of the conference goes to Yahoo! for not only giving away these awesome coffee mugs, but for setting up a full-on coffee shop with baristas to make us our much needed lattes! I really wanted to show the videos from the SMX Ignite as that was one of my favorite parts of the day. But unfortunately the videos aren't live yet. Here's a link to where they should be. :) Maile Ohye's \"DateRank: PageRank for singles\" was my personal favorite, although all the speakers were exceptional. Dana Lookadoo and I interviewed a number of people in sort of a Jay Leno \"man on the street\" sort of way. We hope to have the interviews up tomorrow. Copied! Back to Top",
