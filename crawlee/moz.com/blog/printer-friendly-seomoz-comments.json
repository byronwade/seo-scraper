O By: Oatmeal August 2, 2006 Printer Friendly SEOmoz & Comments Moz News The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Just a quick update folks - I've created a media=\"print\" CSS file that creates printer friendly versions of all SEOmoz's pages. You should now be able to print out the stuff on our site without any major graphical issues. Printed pages won't look perfect (there's a lot of spacing issues), but it's still a huge improvement. I removed the header, footer, logo, and secondary navigation. I also made some modifications to the printer CSS that affect the Page Strength Tool so you can print out reports. The reports for the Keyword Difficulty tool are printable as well.Also, I added a show/hide comments button that toggles the display of comments in a blog entry. This is very useful if you want to print out an entry but you don't want the comments to go with it. Copied! Back to Top",
