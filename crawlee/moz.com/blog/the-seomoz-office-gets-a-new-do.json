Disclaimer: You will not learn any SEO, CRO, SMO or Analytics in this post. You may however feel the urge to watch the Wizard of Oz and eat crepes. As you may have heard, SEOmoz has moved offices (woo hoo!). So we thought it would be nice to take you on a tour of our new digs. We're quite proud that we outgrew the old space and needed a bigger place. Please follow along as I take you on a tour of the new office. We are just a block from Pike Place Market, and within walking distance of Bell Harbor which is where SMX Advanced is held. We have the entire top floor! But let's look at the good stuff... the inside. First, as you first step out of the elevator you may think, \"Wow, this really is a cool space.\" But then... You look down at your feet and exclaim, \"Wow! I feel the need to breakdance!\" [busts a move] Next, as you make your way through the Operations department (who used to sit in a back, very dark corner) you too will be in complete shock at the sunny, openness of the space. Just like this guy: Holy big, bright awesome room batman! Yes we even have a meeting room called the Batcave [see below]. (Ok, the bat cave is a bright, sunny, room that does not resemble a bat cave in any way. But that's ok, cuz we have a bat cave. damnit.) Oh wait. What's this?! Crepes, yes my friends. On \"opening day\" at the new moz office we had a crepe guy! \"I'll have one with nutella, strawberries and bananas please.\" But seriously, we really have a lot of work to do. See, we're working! Well at least Ben Huff is (the dude on the left). :) Nevermind. Oh look we also had fruit (and mimosas ehem), we're not complete pigs you know. Remember Phil [dude on the left]? Last time you saw him he was wearing his PJs. #justsayin Have I mentioned that Rand has an office... with a door... that he can close! This probably isn't overly exciting for most people but for the developers who used to sit right outside his office (aka his desk) and listened to every phone call, webinar and Whiteboard Friday... let me tell ya, they're cheering today. Plus we have 5 meeting rooms now. We used to have one. Again... now there are F I V E. I was late to a meeting earlier because I couldn't find Thunderdome. I thought it was in Spider Skull Island, but apparently those are different. heh. Boys named our meeting rooms if you hadn't guessed that already. Rand in sheer shock: Plus really, who could resist having this right outside the window: The only downside to getting a new office is that now we all have this silly dress code. Wonder Twins... Activate! If you're going to be in town for SMX Advanced, we'll have a few office tours set up. The dates/times will be announced soon, and we'd love to show you around in person! Thanks to my husband, Rudy Lopez who provided the amazing photos (all except the obvious snapshots). Copied! Back to Top",
