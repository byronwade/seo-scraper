By: Ronell Smith August 2, 2016 Moz Content Gets More Robust with the Addition of Topic Trends Content Marketing | Moz Tools The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Moz Content will be retired on November 21, 2016. After much deliberation, we arrived at the difficult decision to shift away from content marketing software back to our core of SEO. For more information, head here. Topic Trends, the latest feature added to Moz Content, allows marketers to quickly access a snapshot of the most popular and the most relevant content in any vertical. By accessing the content in the Content Search index, Topic Trends highlights the topics that were written about most frequently in the previous five days. Since the presidential election is the hottest thing going at the moment, it's little surprise that election news is dominant: Topic Trends displaying the most current, most popular topics This feature is based on the Sharing Trends Graph, which highlights the number of articles matching your search in the Moz Content index, in addition to factoring in the median number of shares per article. By typing \"Featured Snippets\" into the search field, for example, you get a two-line graph that's rich in details that can instantly inform your content strategy: The grey line represents the number of articles published about the topic being searched for over the last five days. The green line depicts the median shares of those articles. “We're using the graph as a rough indicator of audience interest in the topic,” says Jay Leary, Moz's senior product manager for Moz Content and one of the lead architects behind the product. “It’s sort of like a Google Trends, but instead of searches for a topic, we're looking at the sharing of articles about the topic.\" Below the graph you'll find a list of results along with their content metrics, including Reach, Links, Discovery Date and a host of other metrics, including those associated with social shares: Created by content marketers, for content marketers Ever since Matthew J. Brown announced the Beta version of Moz Content at MozCon 2015, we've been focused on designing, creating and delivering a tool that will make it easier for marketers to create the types of content that'll resonate with their audiences. The Tracked Audits feature is ideal for brands who already have an audience, but if you're just getting started, the focus is usually on research. That's where Content Search comes in. The Tracked Audits feature, for example, provides marketers with all of the information a normal content audit would, but has the added dimension of an extended and customizable timeline. Instead of spending hours manually (which I've done numerous times; it's no fun) you can simply have updates emailed to you detailing everything you need to know to track content performance. Also, thanks to Content Search, you can find the most popular pieces of content from across the web via a simple topic search: Results returned for the query \"content marketing\" Not only will this allow you to be better informed about the content types and content topics you should create, but it also alerts you to who your main competitors are for content you desire to create, as well. Share your feedback If you haven't tried Moz Content yet, now is as good a time as any to give it a whirl: https://moz.com/content If you've already been using the product, try out the newest feature and let us know what you think. Either way, we'd love to hear from users of the product. We're always looking for ways to improve it and welcome your input. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below. Copied!
