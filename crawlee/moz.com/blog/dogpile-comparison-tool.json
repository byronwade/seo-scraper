By: Rand Fishkin August 2, 2005 Dogpile Comparison Tool Mobile SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Hot tip from Barry Welford over at cre8asite forums. He points to Dogpile's new comparison tool that's designed to help users see why searching at Dogpile can return \"better\" results. What they do is pull from the search engines you select (defaulted to MSN, Yahoo! & Google) to return results that are the \"best\" of all three. It's fun to see visually how this works, and the color coded results show you which documents Dogpile is displaying in their SERPs. Of course, the real benefit to using Dogpile is being able to influence the Wordtracker counts... but that's another for another blog. Copied! Back to Top",
