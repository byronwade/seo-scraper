N By: Nick Santillo November 15, 2009 Offline Marketing: 11 Ways to Boost Your Site's Exposure Without Busting Your Piggy Bank Online Advertising This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. So, I have been reading SEOmoz for quite sometime now and I thought I would break up all of the online topics with a little swig of offline marketing. For those of you who own your own web business or maybe you're in charge of the overall advertising strategy for someone else's, here are a few realistic, proven ways you can drive new customers to your website and/or business. 1. Sign Spinner Within the last 3 years, sign spinning seems to have taken off across the United States. The trend started in southern California, quickly moved to Florida and sprouted into a national guerilla marketing tactic from those locations. Major corporations have been known to participate. Why has sign spinning become popular? The messages can be dynamic and more interactive than a static advertisement. The human component is also a huge factor that gets people to pay more attention to the message being spun. In fact, the main company who started the trend puts their spinners through intense bootcamp to learn 100's of moves that are more likely to get noticed than without. More people are likely to engage their minds with a message that is moving and breathing as opposed to a sign that has been their for 3 months, is weather worn and being tuned out by a much higher percentage of passersby. Cost: Depending on whether you outsource to a firm or not. If so, it can cost up to $70 per hour for the most skilled sign spinner. 2. Posting Road Signs What? Road Signs? C'mon, I mean, like garage sale signs or political campaign road signs with stakes and everything? Yup, those are them. If you're looking to put your companies name out there and get some fresh local leads, this tactic has been known to work. The aforementioned photo is evidence that an online matchmaking service has done this up and down the eastern seaboard. (nearly identical signs have been found here locally in Boynton Beach, FL - some 1140 miles from Haddon Heights, New Jersey) Cost: $$ 3. Guest Expert on Local Radio Show Take a look at the show listings for all local radio stations and narrow the list down to possible fits for your business. Contact the radio stations and pitch yourself/company as a local expert in that field, possibly with a hook as well. If you have an event coming up, use that in your hook to get them to bite. The show will be able to call upon you in a segment surrounding your industry and you can plug your business/website during that segment. Cost: Free 4. Guest Speaker at Conferences There are a ton of conferences happening in nearly every industry from real estate to construction and you can become a panelist at these events. Most conferences are put on by associations or organizations whose sole responsibility is to successfully hold these events. The conference is really a convergence between experts and everyone else, including people looking to hire. The conference organizers select speakers to be on the panel by taking pitches from business owners and other successful people in the industry. Develop your pitch by researching past events and the specific topics that we're talked about and pitch new ideas that compliment the past with facts and evidence to back it up. If you can find references from people already speaking at or having attended those events, you're golden. If you're selected to speak, you'll be given the opportunity to share your expertise and trust with hundreds and expose your business to them as well. Cost: Free 5. Distributing Flyers Distributing flyers in mall, movies, gym and shopping center parking lots has been known to work for some niche businesses but its got to be a good fit from the get-go. Note: you've generally got to be more aggressive with this tactic and be able to take being hollered at by rent-a-cops patrolling the area. If you don't want to distribute the flyers first hand, try calling local restaurants that deliver food and asking them if they had any contacts of people who they think would would be willing to distribute flyers. Once you've got a few people rounded up and willing to work, monitor their progress to make sure your ads are landing correctly and getting ample viewership. Cost: $/$$ 6. Local Television Advertisements Advertising locally may not be as expensive as you might think but you should be selective. Typically, products sell better than services on television. You've got to do a good job with production so you don't degrade the quality of your brand and good production, if outsourced, can come with a hefty price tag. Nonetheless, this tactic is an obvious way to get qualified offline traffic to your website with the potential to convert as customers. Call all cable/satellite companies that serve your market and test your local market if your budget permits. If you're profitable locally, expand to similar markets nationwide. Cost: $$$ 7. Local Chamber of Commerce Your local chamber of commerce is a great way to become connected locally and network with other business owners who may have a need for what your business does. Often times, they will hold monthly or even weekly breakfasts/networking sessions and they are usually nominal in cost to attend. Similarly with speaking at conferences, they will pull in local distinguished professionals to speak at the events and share information about what they do. Again, a great place to plug your business/website if appropriate. 8. Business Magazines For those of you who are located in larger markets, advertising in business magazines is generally more cost effective than you think. Don't buy a full, half or even quarter-sized ad, stick with a good old 10-30 word ad that will give you enough space for your web address and a call to action. Just enough information to spark interest- enough interest to convert them to a visitor and possibly a customer. Cost: $/$$ 9. Mobile Advertising: Cars, Clothing, Traveling Billboards If you have a commute to your office, why not advertise on your vehicle? There are obviously a few different ways to accomplish this and some more costly than the next. Car Magnets: Placing a car magnet on your vehicle on your way to and from work may be just what you need to drum up some local business. Magnets are inexpensive and they are easily removed. Car Wraps: Likewise with Sign Spinning, car wrapping has become very popular recently and the results can be great but the cost is generally more expensive and although the wrap is temporary, you can't remove it until you're ready to dispose of it- this means no matter where you go, even to church, you'll be advertising your business. Clothing: Getting clothes printed with your logo and domain name on them is a great and inexpensive way to advertise. Wear your business name proudly and others will take note and eventually become customers. Mobile Billboards: If there is an event happening in an area where you know your target demographic will be, why not bring the billboard to them? Mobile Billboards are much more cost effective than a static billboard and will give you the targeting that you're used to. Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlnqzdCmAU Cost: $ - $$$$ 10. Workshops A great way to meet very warm prospects is to hold local workshops that rely on you educating a group of people looking to learn more about what your business has to offer. This does two things for you off the bat, it establishes you and your business as the authority on the subject at hand and brings an interested party on your radar and into your rolodex. Continue to expose yourself and business to people at your workshops and the goodwill will come back around as referrals and new customers. Advertise your workshops by taking out a local classified, starting a meetup at meetup.com, or posting an ad on craigslist.org Cost: Free/$ 11. Media Kit/Press Releases As always, you should have a press kit available. Reporters are always looking for stories with a great hook so be sure to write a convincing press release about your business or a special event that your business will be putting on. Must haves in your businesses press kit: -Backgrounder with historical company/founder information, Facts about the company, Executive Biographies, Past noteworthy press, Photos of Key Executives, Media contact info, Collateral advertising material such as postcards, flyer, newspaper ad, demo or product sample.
