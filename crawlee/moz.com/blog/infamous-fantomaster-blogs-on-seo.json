Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin April 7, 2005 Infamous Fantomaster Blogs on SEO Public Relations The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Among the field of ip delivery, spamming, cloaking and generally violating the search engines' TOS (terms of service), there is one name that stands out from the crowd - Fantomaster. His fame is nearly legendary in the circle of those for whom the moniker - white hat - does not apply.Lucky for us, he's got a terrific, humorous and infinitely readable blog that will probably get added to blogrolls across the SEO world. The blog is part of his larger website, including the sale of products like the Fantomaster Shadowmaker - an \"industrial-strength\" piece of cloaking software.As I write this entry, I wonder whether it will hurt my search engine rankings (for SEOmoz) to link to this notorious \"bad neighborhood\" of websites. I note that the little green pixie dust bar at the bottom of my screen (I run FF of course) is noticeably filled with emerald love, so perhaps Fantomaster & Google do get along. Copied! Back to Top",
