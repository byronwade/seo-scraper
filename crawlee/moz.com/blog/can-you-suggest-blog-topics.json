By: Kasy Allen November 24, 2010 Can You Suggest Blog Topics? Content Marketing This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. I was having a hard time finding the topic I wanted to write about on my first YOUMoz post. So, I did what I do for my clients and started keyword research on the topic I was thinking about. Then I thought, wait, that’s a perfect thing to write about… how to find blogging topics. We have clients reach out to us here at Bridgeline Digital asking for new blog topics and what they should be writing about that people would be interested in. Writer’s block is tough, but finding new blog topics isn’t hard if you use keyword research to help guide you. What is your blog about? What is it you want to write about? Let’s say your blog is about entertaining Outdoor Colorado Enthusiasts (showing a little love for the home state). You write about all things outdoor Colorado, and ski season is right around the corner, but after three years of writing about opening day, you’ve run out of ideas; time to do some keyword research. Head over to your favorite keyword tool. I’ll use Aaron Wall’s SEO Book Keyword Suggestion Tool for this example. I know that the blog is about Colorado and outdoors, and I know that I want to write about the upcoming ski season. So, what keywords can we get from “Colorado + Outdoor + Ski”? No results are returned. Let’s refine our search, “Colorado + Ski” – now we’re talking… From this list, do you think you can find some blog ideas? How about blogging about your favorite ski area in Colorado? Can you get your hands on historical ski resort maps that ski enthusiast would appreciate? Oh, how about doing a daily snow report? And of course, the topic only a true enthusiast would enjoy, a contest that encourages visitors to share a picture of their oldest season pass from their favorite Colorado ski area. Don’t think about the list as titles for your blog post, but what you can do with the keywords that pertain to your blog. For example, instead of “Colorado ski vacations,” maybe you can write a post about your favorite Colorado ski vacation and encourage your readers to comment on their own favorite spots. So, how do you think I came up with the title of this blog post? Hmm… Copied! Back to Top",
