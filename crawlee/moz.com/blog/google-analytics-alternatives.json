Table of Contents Copied! By: Jess Joyce February 22, 2023 20 Google Analytics Alternatives SEO Analytics | SEO Reporting The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. The adage is that if you're not paying for the service, you are the product. Unfortunately, this rings especially true in the analytics world. The analytics space is changing, though, and there are many alternatives — both free and paid — that take into account privacy, cookie-less tracking, GDPR compliance, core web vitals, and more. The current leader in the analytics space is Universal Analytics (UA), which has been tracking web data since 2005. But Google is going to stop tracking any new data in UA as of July 1, 2023 (Happy Canada Day?). This is a move to get users to migrate to Google Analytics 4 (GA4), which is a whole new way of tracking and navigating. In a move from sessions to an event model, GA4 will require some knowledge and familiarity to get up and running, as there’s quite a bit changing. If you haven’t yet set up GA4 yet, or are on the fence, now is the time to take a look at what else is out there and how the landscape has changed. We've broken the alternatives up into three categories: Web analyticsProduct analyticsData warehousing solutions How legal is Google Analytics? The short answer is: depends on where your visitors are from. Without getting too deep into legal jargon, the user has control over the options now and although there are a few lawsuits out there I'm sure Google will make the proper adjustments to ensure that everyone using it will be mostly covered, eventually. This isn't happening right now and under GDPR there are requirements that Google Analytics isn't passing. Also, by using a product that's integrated into other products I doubt they'll ever see 100% coverage. Even if you’re planning on installing Google Analytics 4, you can run an alternative to ensure that you’re getting the right data and test as you go Web Analytics More than a visitor counter, but often simplified, web analytics providers focus on giving services to small businesses, bloggers, and small websites. Their metrics are also the closest to Google Analytics. Most of the web analytics tools below are easy to maintain, quick to install, and don't need self-hosting. However, some will offer self-hosting in addition to their regular services. Fathom Analytics Launched in 2018, Fathom Analytics is a cookie-less, privacy-focused Google Analytics alternative that’s really simple to use. They care about user privacy and pioneered proprietary routes in compliance with the EU for EU visitors. Calling the route \"EU isolation\", Fathom Analytics is also GDPR, PECR, COPPA, CCPA, and ePrivacy compliant. Features of Fathom Analytics include: Seven-day free trialPrices start at $14 per month for up to 100,000 page viewsCan include up to 50 sitesShows live visitors and where they’re navigatingOffers uptime monitoring, event filtering, email reports, ad blocker bypassing, live visitor information, and much more from a bootstrapped company Being privacy-focused, Fathom Analytics has a beautiful interface and offers unlimited CSV exports of your data available at any time. This allows you to conveniently connect it to other data sources. In addition, Fathom is expected to release a backup option for GA data in the near future. DEMO FATHOM ANALYTICS Matomo Previously named Pikqwik, Matomo (\"keep your data in your own hands\") is an open-source, cookie-free tracking, and GDPR-compliant analytics tool offering a search engine and keywords section where you can connect with Google Search Console data. Additional Matomo features include: Customizable dashboard.Real-time data insights (pages visited, visitor summary, conversions, etc).E-commerce analytics.Event tracking (analyzes user interaction on apps or websites).Measures CTR, clicks, and impressions for text and image banners as well as other page elements.Visitor geolocation (stats can be viewed on maps by city, region, or country).Page and site speed reports.Page performance (number of views, bounce rates). You can host Matomo on your own servers for free. Otherwise, their cloud pricing starts at $29/month after a 21-day free trial for 50,000 hits (up to 30 websites). DEMO MATOMO Cloudflare If you're already using Cloudflare's CDN solution, then there's no setup required. You can simply authorize the web analytics to start tracking inside your account. You can add up to 10 websites for free, and there's no need for a cookie banner, since they do not collect personal data. In addition to tracking standard metrics — page views, visits, load times, bandwidth, etc. — Cloudflare has incorporated Core Web Vitals metrics. These are measured each across your tracked websites, and can email you weekly with updates — very handy. Cloudflare installation is light on page load, since you can proxy it through your Cloudflare setup. Alternatively, you can install their lightweight Javascript code (or \"beacon\", as they call it). Although Cloudflare doesn't say they are GDPR compliant, what they do say is that they are considered an \"Operator Essential Services\" under the EU Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems. You can assume that Cloudflare is tracking something along the way, with a free price tag and with other offerings available where data could be shared. Cloudflare is closest to server analytics without going directly to your server. It's only available in specific areas, so you might have to pay for this. DEMO CLOUDFLARE Adobe Analytics Adobe Analytics is a popular analysis platform that provides tools essential for collecting relevant data concerning customer experience. Company analysts and online marketers frequently depend on it for improving customer satisfaction. Applying Adobe Analytics to your business website can help you determine what leads to conversions. For example, did changing content or the CTA increase conversions? Did adding more visual aids increase the number of inquiries about a certain service or product? Adobe analytics is marketed as an enterprise analytics solution with audience insights, advertising analytics, cohort analysis, customer journey analysis, remarketing triggers, and much more. It truly could fit your web analytics or product analytics depending on how your team deploys it, and it has been around for quite a while just like Google Analytics.

Data warehousing solutions It's always good to have your data backed up and if you have a lot of history in Universal Analytics it would be a good place to start. There are even services to connect all these solutions together seamlessly, such as Funnel. While these have additional costs, you can save all your data for many years without a problem coming up so you can refer to them when need be. Google BigQuery / Google Cloud Available with an easy connection to your GA4 data if you're leaning that way. Google lists BigQuery as enterprise and there will be limits to how much data you can send to BigQuery before paying. They offer real-time analytics with built-in query acceleration and with the scale of data that Google handles we can be pretty sure that they’ll be able to handle it. Google Cloud Storage offers standard, nearline, coldline, and archive storage options. One suggestion is if you’re using Google for backups to ensure you have a secondary account attached to it in case your primary account loses access, which I’ve seen happen from time to time. They provide a migration from some tools and their pricing is based on data, so it’s free up to 10GB. They created a billing calculator for easy cost analysis once you get into the paid side. Amazon - AWS AWS states that they support more compliance certifications and security measures than all other cloud providers. They allow for backup of all data types and have redundancy built in that you would expect at the Amazon level. Like Google they have a calculator to estimate a pricing model for your team as they have a lot of other services integrated into this that you can take advantage of there. Snowflake Snowflake provides a data cloud and isn’t Google or Amazon, which may appeal to some. It supports data science, data lakes, and data warehousing on the three top clouds with their fully automated solution. They’re HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 1 and SOC 2 Type 2 compliant, and FedRAMP Authorized and have a 30 day free trial with all plans you can check out as well as a “pay for usage” option or a “pay for usage upfront” option too. Recap and recommendations On July 1, 2023, Universal Analytics will stop tracking any new data, and then by EOY 2023 all UA data will be removed by Google — so back up your data! Think about warehousing your data long term for your Universal Analytics and moving forward. Then, make a plan for how you’re going to be tracking moving forward. Talk options and thoughts with stakeholders. Install GA4 now (or yesterday!) or try the options above out, as none of these are created equal and many have free trials. Copied! Back to Top",
