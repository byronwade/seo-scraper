By: Nichole Elizabeth DeMeré July 20, 2016 ​How to Create Images That Attract & Convince Your Target Niche Content Marketing | Design The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Any old picture might be worth a thousand words. But your target niche doesn’t need or want a thousand words. Your ideal audience needs the right words, paired with the right images, to tell a story that uniquely appeals to their deepest desires. Studies show that people understand images faster than words, remember them longer, and if there’s a discrepancy between what we see and what we hear, our brains will choose to believe what they see. Our brains prioritize visual information over any other kind, which makes images the fast-track to connection all marketers are looking for. So don’t just slap some text on a stock photo and call it good. You can do better. Much better. And I'll show you how. Understand the symbolic underpinnings This homepage from Seer Interactive does a lot right. The copy below this central image is golden: \"We’re Seer. We pride ourselves on outcaring the competition.\" Outcaring? That’s genius! But, I would argue, pairing this image with these words, \"It’s not just marketing, it’s personal,\" is less than genius. There’s nothing personal about this picture. Sure, there are people in it, but chatting with a group of coworkers doesn’t say \"personal\" to me. It says corporate. What if they paired those words with this free image by Greg Rakozy from Unsplash? There’s something about this image that isn’t just personal; it’s intimate. Two people connecting in the dark, surrounded by snowflakes that almost look like white noise. Could this be a metaphor for reaching out through the noise of the Internet to make a personal connection? To get someone to fall in love (with your brand) even? Many philosophers, anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists have pointed out that humans are uniquely symbolic creatures. – Clay Routledge Ph.D., The Power of Symbolism, Psychology Today A truly powerful image speaks to us on a symbolic level, feeding us information by intuition and association. Humans are associative creatures. We naturally derive deep, multifaceted meanings from visual cues, an idea brought into prominence by both Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. The magic behind an effective symbol is its ability to deliver messages to both our conscious minds and subconscious awareness. When choosing the right image for marketing copy — whether an ad or the \"hero\" section of your website — consider not just what you want to tell people, but what you want them to feel. A symbol must possess at one and the same time a double or a multiple significance ... Thus all symbols possess both a 'face' and a 'hidden' value, and it is one of the great achievements of psychology to have shown how the 'hidden' value is generally, from the point of view of function, the more important. ...Behind this face value lies a mass of undifferentiated feelings and impulses, which do not rise into consciousness, which we could not adequately put into words even if we wanted to... and which, though they go unattended to, powerfully influence our behavior. – F.C. Bartlett, 'The social functions of symbols,' Astralasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy And, of course, as you're looking through images, consider this: What type of images and experiences will resonate with your target audience’s deepest desires? This, of course, requires you to have built out a robust buyer persona that includes not just their demographic information with a catchy name but also their extracurricular passions: the driving forces that get them out of bed and into the office each day. As with conversion copywriting, the key to success is identifying motivations and using them to create a visual representation of your niche’s most desired outcomes. Set the stage for an experience, not just a product In keeping with the theme of images that deliver the desired outcome, the most effective online ads do this in a way that invites the viewer to experience that outcome. Instead of featuring simply a product, for example, these ads set the stage for the experience that buying the product just might enable you to have. ModCloth is a master of this. Doesn’t this image make you want to take a nap in a nice, cozy cabin? You can get that experience (or something like it) if you buy their $200 hammock. Unless you live in the deep woods of the Appalachian mountains, your home will never look like this. But some of us wish ours did, and we're clearly the target audience. This picture speaks to our deepest need to get away from everyone and everything for some much-needed rest and recuperation. When choosing images, it's just as important to consider symbolism as it is to consider the target viewers. What experience will resonate with them most? What images will sell their desired experiences? ModCloth’s recent \"road trip\" slider doesn’t say anything about the clothes they’re trying to sell, for example. But it does speak to a sense of adventure and the power of female friendships, both of which are defining characteristics of their target niche of millennial women with a delightfully quirky fashion sense. You don’t have to be a clothing company to capitalize on this idea or even a B2C company. Check out how these B2B companies use images to make their words not just read, but felt. Don’t you feel like you’re Superman out for a midnight joyride? All the world at your fingertips? Yeah, that’s the point. What they’re selling, essentially, is omniscience via data. All the benefits of DC Comics-like superpowers, minus the kryptonite. You might not catch it at first glance, but look at how cozy these people are. They’re wearing knit sweaters (not suits) while cradling warm cappuccinos in their hands — clearly, this sales meeting is going well. No pressure tactics here. Quite the opposite. For this example from Blitz Marketing, you’ll have to visit their website, because this isn’t a static image — it’s a video montage designed to get you PUMPED! Energy practically radiates off the screen (which, we are left to infer, is the feeling you’d get all the time if you worked with this creative marketing agency). Piston, another ad agency, takes a more subtle approach, which I love. Instead of having your standard stock photo of \"man in a suit,\" they did a custom photo shoot and added quirky elements, like a pink candy ring. I find this image particularly powerful because it effectively sets up an expectation (man in a suit), then adds a completely unexpected element (candy ring), which is conveniently located behind the word CREATIVE. This illustrates just how creative this agency is while remaining utterly professional. Numbers are compelling. Numbers with visual aids? Unstoppable. Let’s say your buyer persona isn’t driven by emotion. Show this persona a grid of city lights from 2,000 feet up, and he or she won’t feel like Superman. They’ll be wondering what this has to do with the ROI they can expect. Someone get this persona some numbers already. When conversion depends heavily on gaining credibility, pictures can be very compelling. In fact, one study out of the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand showed that simply having an image makes the text alongside that image more believable, even if the image had nothing at all to do with the text. When people evaluate claims, they often rely on what comedian Stephen Colbert calls 'truthiness,' or subjective feelings of truth. – Nonprobative photographs (or words) inflate truthiness, by E.J. Newman, M. Garry, D.M. Bernstein, J. Kantner, D.S. Lindsay Essentially, any image is better than nothing. But the right image? It’s worth even more. In a similar study by the Psychology departments at both Colorado State University and the University of California, researchers experimented with brain images. Brain images are believed to have a particularly persuasive influence on the public perception of research on cognition. Three experiments are reported showing that presenting brain images with articles summarizing cognitive neuroscience research resulted in higher ratings of scientific reasoning for arguments made in those articles, as compared to articles accompanied by bar graphs, a topographical map of brain activation, or no image. – Seeing is believing: The effect of brain images on judgments of scientific reasoning by David P. McCabe and Alan D. Castel However, what if we traded in this either/or philosophy (either picture or no picture, either picture or bar graph) for a philosophy that uses the best of all resources? Having the right image, supported by the right words, and given credibility by real numbers (as statistics or in graphs/charts) is the most effective possible combination. Statistics have also proven to be compelling. In Blinded with science: Trivial graphs and formulas increase ad persuasiveness and belief in product efficacy, the study out of Cornell University reveals that just the appearance of being scientific increases an ad’s persuasiveness. What does that \"appearance\" require? Graphs. Simple, unadorned graphs. And, those graphs were even more effective at persuading people who had “a greater belief in science” (e.g., your logical buyer persona). Put the right words together with the right image, then overlay with a supportive set of numbers, and you can convince even the most logical persona that you have the solutions they seek. Caveat: When the name of the game is building credibility, don’t undermine yourself with shoddy data and lazy analysis. One of your smart customers will, without fail, call you out on it. Graphs and charts don’t have to be fancy or complicated to be convincing. Check out these two graphs from the Kissmetrics article Most of Your A/B Test Results are Illusory and That’s Okay by Will Kurt. Do you even need to read the rest of the article to get the point? (Though you will want to read the article to find out exactly what that scientist is doing so right.) This is highly effective data storytelling that shows you, at a glance, the central point the author is trying to make. CubeYou, a social data mining company that turns raw numbers into actionable insights, does great data storytelling by combining stats and images. Not only do these visuals deliver demographic information, they put a face on the target at the same time, effectively appealing to both logical and more intuitive personas in one fell swoop. And for even more powerful images, look at the data visualizations Big Mountain Data put together of the #WhyIStayed domestic violence hashtag. Talk about telling an impactful story. Then there are infographics that include data visualization, images, and analysis. I love this one from CyberPRMusic.com. It’s all about telling their story Uninspired visuals are everywhere. Seriously, they’re easy to find. In researching this article, I could find 20 bad images for every one good one I’ve included here. Herein lies an opportunity to stand out. Maybe the intersection of words, images, and numbers isn’t well understood in online marketing. Maybe having free stock photos at our fingertips has made us lazy in their use. Maybe there aren’t enough English majors touting the benefits of effective symbolism. Whatever the reason, you now have the chance to go beyond telling your target niche about your product or service’s features and benefits. You have the ability to set your brand apart by showing them just how great life can be. Free tools such as Visage make it possible. But first, you have to care enough to make compelling images a priority. What are your thoughts on using stunning visuals as needle-movers for your brand? Copied! Back to Top",
