  "content": "SEO and Social Media Benchmarking SEO Tools By: Rob Ousbey November 22, 2009 Table of Contents Copied! By: Rob Ousbey November 22, 2009 SEO and Social Media Benchmarking SEO Tools Introduction We'll often rattle off various metrics quite casually in conversation, but it's easy to forget that others (such as your clients!) might not know whether these are big numbers or small ones. For example: \"We've just published a guest post on a site with Domain mozTrust 5.67. Mr_Gadget mentioned it to his 64 thousand followers, and it managed to get over 1,000 Diggs.\" This post should be useful to anyone who needs to orientate themselves around such numbers. The Website Benchmarks section shows metrics for around half a dozen sites from ten different niches (based on the list originally prepared for comparing SEOMoz Trifecta data.) This is followed by Social Media Benchmarks, to give an idea of the impact and influence of votes and people on three popular social websites. Links and Traffic: Website Benchmarks This section uses three particular metrics: Domain mozRank: the strength of a website, based on the sites & pages that link to it, Domain mozTrust: the trustworthiness of a website, based on links from trusted sites & pages, Unique Vistors: Compete.com's estimate of the number of monthly unique visitors to a site. N.B.: The 'moz' metrics use data exposed by SEOMoz's Linkscape, and are on an exponential scale from 0 - 10. Data collected in 2006 suggested that the no visitor metric - Compete included - could be used to precisely estimate unique visitors to blogs at the time.

After a user submits a link (refered to as a story) other users 'Digg' the story if they like it. Stories with a greater number of Diggs are more likely to be promoted to the site's front page, be seen by more visitors, and receive more traffic. Users can also 'bury' stories that are off-topic or duplicate. Read more at How Digg Works. # of Diggs Likely success Example Story 1+ Little or no exposure Example 10+ A little exposure Example 100+ Mild exposure, moderate success Example 500+ Reasonable exposure, good success - likely to have been promoted with the submission category Example 1,000+ Good exposure & likely to be promoted to the front page, successful content Example 2,000+ Lots of exposure, highly successful Example 10,000+ The very top echelon of articles, extremely successful content. Example Reddit Reddit is a newer, but increasingly popular social media site. Users can up-vote and down-vote submitted links to give a link a total number of 'points'. The most popular stories are promoted to the front page of their category, or the site. Read more at the Reddit FAQ. Points Likely success Example Link 1+ Little or no exposure Example 10+ A little exposure, may send some visits page Example 100+ Good exposure & likely to be promoted to the category's front page, sends a moderate amount of traffic Example 500+ Very good exposure & likely to be promoted to the front page Example 1,000+ Excellent exposure, highly successful & will send considerable traffic to the page Example 3,000+ Amongst the top links on the site, extremely popular and widely viewed Example Twitter Twitter is a networking website where individuals share their 'statuses', and follow others doing the same. The most fundamental metric available on the site is the number of 'followers' a user has - and provides a reasonable indication of their popularlity and influence. Read more at Twitter's Getting Started page. Followers Typical behaviour Example User 1+ Very new, or dormant user Example 10+ Likely to be using the site for social purposes, has influence within a close circle of friends Example 100+ Connecting with a modest number of people, has influence amongst a wide circle of friends or industry colleagues Example 1,000+ Fairly well known within their industry, and likely to have influence well beyond those they know personally Example 10,000+ Very well known with their industry or niche; likely to have some off-line awareness Example 100,000+ Popular amongst a wide variety of users; likely to very influential and be widely 'retweeted' Example 1,000,000+ Amongst the top 200 users and very influential within the site; almost certainly a genuine off-line celebrity Example Copied!
