By: Rand Fishkin March 14, 2006 Experience with Internal 301s Technical SEO The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Just wanted to start on a thread on the subject of internal 301 re-directs. What's been your general experience when re-directing a page or set of pages to the \"canonical\" or new version? How long have the engines taken to catch up? For us, I've noticed that Google takes between 2 and 6 weeks to recognize and properly index, although the rankings seem to follow fairly directly (so links must be re-directing, too). For MSN, it's a bit shorter - 1-3 weeks depending on the site. Yahoo! can take the longest, with between 4-8 weeks being standard, although there are exceptions on bigger sites. External 301s is a different story - the engines (except MSN) are terrible about catching up with those. Copied! Back to Top",
