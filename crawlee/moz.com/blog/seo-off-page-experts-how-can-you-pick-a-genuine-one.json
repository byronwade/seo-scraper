A By: adam.price_it3.com October 17, 2007 SEO Off-Page Experts â€“ How Can You Pick a Genuine One? Public Relations This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. If you’re expecting me to provide the answer to this, I’m very sorry but I can’t! It’s because I don’t have the answer I felt it would be a genuine topic for discussion. Choosing any reliable and talented partner in any industry is difficult enough, but finding genuine partners in the SEO world is awfully tough - according to web developers' websites all over the world, they all provide this service! I believe there is only so much you can do as an individual to grow a business. For some, this is more than enough for the lifestyle and position they want to achieve, and I say good luck to them. For me, I like to work with other like-minded individuals, or with companies who share a common goal as me. I like people who are experts at what they do and can demonstrate not only their impressive results, but the ability for them to grow with you and form new ideas together. From there, you can build bigger and better projects. This said, it’s very rare you make the right choice first time around – anybody who has had any structural building work done in the UK will understand exactly what I’m talking about here! But maybe this post will get people like me (who are looking for off-page experts) to find the right experts quicker and with less pain and cost through failed choices. This post is aimed at encouraging the off-page experts here to offer questions for us to ask. Also, what are the typical responses an expert might give? Even better, what are the responses to watch out for that are the “tell tale tips” that this person doesn’t really have a clue? As I said, finding partners is difficult but the wrong off-page partner could cost a fortune before you even realise they were the wrong choice! I look forward to hearing from the experts here and anybody else in my position. Copied! Back to Top",
