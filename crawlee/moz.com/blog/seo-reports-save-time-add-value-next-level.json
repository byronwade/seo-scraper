By: Jo Cameron May 17, 2017 Tasty SEO Report Recipes to Save Time & Add Value for Clients [Next Level] SEO Reporting | SEO Tools | SEO Basics Reporting can be the height of tedium. You spend your time making those reports, your client may (or may not) spend their time trying to understand them. And then, in the end, we’re all left with some unanswered questions and a rumble in the tum of dissatisfaction. I’m going to take some basic metrics, throw in some culinary metaphors, and take your client reporting to the next level. By the end of this article you’ll know how to whip up intelligent SEO reports for your clients (or potential clients) that will deliver actionable insights any search chef worth their salt would be proud of. [Part one] Freshly foraged keywords on sourdough to power your campaign I’ve got intel on some really tasty keywords; did you know you can scoop these up like wild porcini mushrooms using your website categories? The trick is to find the keywords that you can use to make a lovely risotto, and discard the ones that taste nasty. The overabundance of keywords has become a bit of a challenge for SEOs. Google is better at gauging user intent — it’s kind of their thing, right? This results in the types of keywords that send traffic to your clients expanding, and it’s becoming trickier to track every. single. keyword. Of course, with a budget big enough almost anything is possible, but why hemorrhage cash on tracking the keyword minutiae when you can wrangle intelligent data by tracking a sample of keywords from a few pots? With Keyword Explorer, you can save your foraged terms to lists. By bundling together similar \"species,\" you'll get a top-level view of the breadth and depth of search behavior within the categories of your niche. Easily compare volume, difficulty, opportunity, and potential to instigate a data-driven approach to website architecture. You’ll also know, at a glance, where to expand on certain topics and apply more resources to content creation. With these metrics in hand and your client’s industry knowledge, you can cherry-pick keywords to track ranking positions week over week and add them to your Moz Pro campaign with the click of a button. What’s the recipe?Step 1: Pluck keywords from the category pages of your client’s site. Step 2: Find keyword suggestions in Keyword Explorer. Step 3: Group by low lexicon to bundle together similar keywords to gather up that long tail. Step 4: Analyze and save relevant results to a list Step 5: Head to the Keyword Lists and compare the metrics: where is the opportunity? Can you compete with the level of difficulty? Is there a high-volume long tail that you can dig in to? Step 6: Add sample keywords from your pots directly to your campaign. Bonus step: Repeat for products or other topic segments of the niche. Don’t forget to drill into the keywords that are turning up here to see if there are categories and subcategories you hadn’t thought of. These can be targeted in existing content to further extend the relevancy and reach of your client’s content. Or it may inspire new content which can help to grow the authority of the site. Why your client will be impressedThrough solid, informed research, you’ll be able to demonstrate why their site should be structured with certain categories on the top-level navigation right down to product pages. You’ll also be able to prioritize work on building, improving, or refining content on certain sections of the site by understanding the breakdown of search behavior and demand. Are you seeing lots of keywords with a good level of volume and lower difficulty? Or more in-depth long tail with low search volume? Or fewer different keywords with high search volume but stronger competition? Let the demand drive the machine forward and make sure you’re giving the hordes what they want. All this helps to further develop your understanding of the ways people search so you can make informed decisions about which keywords to track. [Part two] Palate-cleansing lemon keyword label sorbetBefore diving into the next course you need to cleanse your palate with a lemon \"label\" sorbet. In Part One, we talked about the struggle of maintaining gigantic lists of keywords. We’ve sampled keywords from our foraged pots, keeping these arranged and segmented in our Moz Pro campaign. Now you want to give those tracked keywords a more defined purpose in life. This will help to reinforce to your client why you’re tracking these keywords, what the goal is for tracking them, and in what sort of timeframe you’re anticipating results. Types of labels may include: Local keywords: Is your business serving local people, like a mushroom walking tour? You can add geo modifiers to your keywords and label them as such.Long-tail keywords: Might have lower search volume, but focused intent can convert well for your client.High-priority keywords: Where you’re shoveling more resources, these keywords are more likely impacting the other keyword segments.Brand keywords: Mirror, mirror on the wall... yeah, we all want those vanity keywords, don’t lie. You can manage brand keywords automatically through \"Manage Brand Rules\" in Moz Pro: A generous scoop of tasty lemon \"label\" sorbet will make all the work you do and progress you achieve infinitely easier to report on with clear, actionable focus. What’s the recipe?Step 1: Label your keywords like a pro. Step 2: Filter by labels in the Ranking tab to analyze Search Visibility for your keyword segments. In this example, I’m comparing our visibility for \"learn\" keywords against \"guide\" keywords: Step 3: Create a custom report for your keyword segments. Step 4: Add a drizzle of balsamic vinegar by triggering the Optimize button — now you can send the latest on-page reporting with your super-focused ranking report. Why your client will be impressedYour ranking reports will be like nothing your client has ever tasted.
