The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Congratulations SEOmoz Team on all of your big news the past week! To celebrate these bold moves into the future and the SEOmoz Seminar I am hosting a gathering at the Metropolitan Cafe in Capitol Hill. The Metropolitan Cafe is fun place with pool, darts, board games, a fire place, AND the rustic charms of a parisian street cafe. Once I stepped into Cafe Metropolitain, I fell in LOVE......... The feeling of being transported to an outdoor evening in Europe where the place is clean and the people around are so friendly. Great to take a date or have a large group to celebrate any special occasion. Free WiFi for my laptop, Free Game Room and the best cheese cakes and fresh grilled sandwiches around. When: Sunday Sept. 30th 5pm until Patrick's liver fails Where: 1701 E Olive Way (2 blocks west of Broadway, 1 block North of Denny) I hope to see you there! And as a bonus I will buy the first few pitchers. Copied! Back to Top",
