By: Cheryl Draper Edited By: Emilie Martin March 7, 2024 Meet Our MozCon 2024 Community Speakers SEO Events | Moz News Major high fives and fist bumps for each and every person who took the time to submit a pitch for a chance to nab a MozCon 2024 Community Speaker spot! The caliber of pitches we received this year was undeniably one of the strongest we‚Äôve ever seen, which is both exciting for the future of the industry and incredibly difficult for our speaker selection committee. With only two open community speaker spots and hundreds of pitches ranging from how to grow your career as an SEO to all manner of AI and ChatGPT-related entries, the competition was tough. Our selection committee read, watched, and researched, whittling things down to a shortlist of top contenders, and then read, watched, and researched some more to determine if a potential speaker and their talk would be a perfect fit for the MozCon stage this June. We take lots of things into account during our review, but ultimately, there are four main factors that determine our final selections: Strength of the pitch (e.g., value, relevance to the audience, etc.)Can the content reasonably be delivered in the time allotted?Does it fit with the overall programming and agenda? Will the topic have overlap with other presentations on the main lineup? After much deliberation, we settled on two community speakers that we‚Äôre confident are going to be a great addition to the MozCon Stage. Ready to meet our MozCon Community Speakers?
