Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin September 30, 2005 Dodge the Sandbox for $79... Is this for real? Blogging The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. mrkryz03 at SEOChat uncovered some great information about a new product purporting to prevent your site from falling prey to Google's sandbox. The methodology is somewhat ingenious and creative - sending fake traffic to the search engines for your site and its keywords, which is likely a component that helps new sites escape \"boxing\", but as mrkryz points out, this technique is \"of questionable ethics and even more questionable in results\". If you're looking to dodge sandboxing, my guess is that no $79 program on the web is going to help, no matter the brilliance of the design. Kudos to the creators, though, for being so creative and taking advantage of a very desperate market... These guys are the ambulance chasers of the SEO industry. There's a thread at SEOChat on the subject. Copied! Back to Top",
