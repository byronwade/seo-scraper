By: Jonathon Colman July 23, 2012 How to Find the Best Coffee in Seattle During #MozCon SEO Events This YouMoz entry was submitted by one of our community members. The author’s views are entirely their own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. Howdy SEOmoz fans! (Note: I have to pay Rand a dollar every time someone shares this post because I used his catch-phrase) Coming into town for MozCon this week? Worried about choosing between all of Seattle's insanely awesome coffee shops to get your daily caffeine fix? Thinking of letting the Paradox of Choice drive you to get a cup of Starbucks instead of something uniquely local? My advice is to not play it safe and to completely avoid going to Starbucks, Tully's, or (God help us) Seattle's \"Best\". Instead, I suggest an altogether different tactic: try out a number of new local places that you've never heard of and drink it all in; not just the coffee, but the experience. And a great cup of coffee is an experience best shared with your fellow SEOs, so bring them along! You may be wondering: Jon, what's your authority in these matters? Why should I listen to you? Heck, you're not even an SEO anymore! Well, if you're like me – and I am – then you're a coffee-based life-form. You live and breathe caffeine; it's in your pores and your pits, your brain and even your bunions. Coffee's not just part of your diet, but rather a part of your identity, your DNA, your very soul. No one loves coffee more than I do... not even Joanna! (gasp) So while others here on the YouMoz Blog might offer you insights on minor topics like JavaScript crawlability, web site performance, server log analysis, link-building with local events, and other technical marketing issues, I've got truly actionable tips on a topic that's far more important and relevant to your work: where to find the best coffee in Seattle. Hang on to your butts. It's coffee-time! Photo © bbaltimore on Flickr (creative commons - some rights reserved) The Top 10 Best Cups of Coffee in Seattle So if you're a coffee-lover and you're visiting town for MozCon, here are the places you need to get your coffee passport stamped. Note that I'm highly biased in favor of flavor, authenticity, and quality. So this isn't some sort of Seattle Tourism Board-approved, Everyman list where every single shop in the city gets a Gold Star For Trying Real Hard – only the very best and brightest (and, um, jitteriest) appear below. Full Disclosure: I'm not doing any consulting whatsoever right now; none of the coffee shops in the list below are there because they're my clients or friends or because they paid me or offered kickbacks of any sort to appear here. If anything, I paid them by buying so much of their coffee! So these coffeehouses had to earn their way onto my list by being crazy delicious. #10: Caffe Ladro Photo © Jonathon Colman (creative commons - some rights reserved) Ladro was my first cup of true Seattle coffee and it's true what they say: you never forget your first. I like their Fremont and Queen Anne locations better than this one, but you'll still find great espresso drinks at any Ladro you walk into. I've seen good latte art coming from the baristas at this location, so be sure to ask for that (and please tip extra – I recommend at least 20% on the low end) if they're not busy and if that's your thing. Never, ever ask for extras like latte art during the morning rush, or you risk the ire of the baristas as well as your fellow patrons. Me, I think any time looking at coffee is time spent not drinking it. Web site http://www.caffeladro.com/ Street address 801 Pine St. Seattle, WA 98101 and other locations around Seattle Hours 5:30am-7:00pm Distance from MozCon 0.3 miles, 8 minutes Map from MozCon Google walking directions Aggregate Yelp rating 3.5 out of 5.0 as of July 14, 2012 Number of Yelp reviews 42 reviews as of July 14, 2012 Google+ Local/Zagat score 21 out of 30 as of July 14, 2012 Number of Google+ Local reviews 16 reviews as of July 14, 2012 Jon's CoffeeRank Jack Nicholson in 1974 #9: Fonte Coffee Roaster and Wine Bar Photo © Jonathon Colman (creative commons - some rights reserved) This is my go-to place whenever I'm in to downtown core because it's easy to get to from just about anywhere. The interior has schwanky modern decor and you'd do well to take your date here before (or after) visiting the Seattle Art Museum, which is conveniently located right across the street. One of the things I love about getting coffee here is that it always takes a little while; when I've got time to spare, I see that as a mark of hand-crafted quality. Perfection can't be rushed! Their food is great and I especially recommend getting breakfast here if you want something a little more upscale than, say, a greasy breakfast sandwich (not that there's anything wrong with that!). Along with Stumptown (#2 below), Fonte also made Rand's list. Web site http://cafefonte.com/ Street address 1321 First Ave. Seattle, WA 98101 Hours 7:00am-10:00pm Distance from MozCon 0.5 miles, 11 minutes Map from MozCon Google walking directions Aggregate Yelp rating 4.0 out of 5.0 as of July 14, 2012 Number of Yelp reviews 206 reviews as of July 14, 2012 Google+ Local/Zagat score 20 out of 30 as of July 14, 2012 Number of Google+ Local reviews 39 reviews as of July 14, 2012 Jon's CoffeeRank Date night with Zooey Deschanel/Michael Fassbender (take your pick) #8: Victrola Coffee Roasters Photo © Jonathon Colman (creative commons - some rights reserved) Besides having one of the best pour-over cuppas in town, Victrola also has one of the quieter cafe spaces, which can provide a great respite from the usual hustle and bustle of a high-tech city. And this quiet, laid-back attitude extends to the preparation of your coffee as well: expect it to take a little while because this ain't no Starbucks. But good things come to those who wait and you'll find your cup to be exceptionally smooth and well-crafted. Victrola seems to use a lighter roast of coffee than most shops in town, so the flavor of their coffee offers you more of the complexities of each bean's origin rather than the smoky, semi-sweet characteristics of the darker roasts that you tend to see in the Northwest. This location has a roastery on site, so if the shop's not busy, ask for a tour. Web site http://victrolacoffee.com/ Street address 310 E.

It's right by SEOmoz HQ and just above Pike Place Market, so if you need something to get you going while exploring the downtown core, this is the place for you. Like many things in Seattle, looks can be deceiving; most folks walk right by this place without giving it another look because it's so small. But it's a far better cuppa than anything else you'll find in the immediate Market area. And if you're out late on Friday or Saturday nights, stop back in for Biscuit B*tch until 2:30am!

It's the real deal here: Mario, the owner, is actually from Italy, has Italian staff, and has paid attention to all the details so that just entering the cafe will make you feel like you've walked off the streets of Florence. A wonderful respite from misty rain and grey skies. Oh, and did I mention the coffee? I should mention that it's exceptional. If you like your coffee sweet, then try their mocha – one sip and you'll never go back to ordering syrupy, gloppy, oily fare from a chain again. Sweet Spot Alert! Caffe Senso Unico is the closest, best coffee to MozCon that you'll find on this list – just two blocks away from the Westin Hotel and it opens bright and early. But don't forget to leave extra time if you arrive during the morning rush. They get busy! Web site http://caffesensounico.com/ Street address 622 Olive Way Seattle, WA 98101 Hours 6:00am-5:00pm Distance from MozCon 0.2 miles, 4 minutes Map from MozCon Google walking directions Aggregate Yelp rating 4.5 out of 5.0 as of July 14, 2012 Number of Yelp reviews 72 reviews as of July 14, 2012 Google+ Local/Zagat score 28 out of 30 as of July 14, 2012 Number of Google+ Local reviews 15 reviews as of July 14, 2012 Jon's CoffeeRank They make you a coffee you can't refuse #5: Fuel Photo © Curtis Cronn on Flickr (creative commons - some rights reserved) Like Ladro, Fuel is another small, local group of shops in the Seattle area. If you buy into the whole coffee-as-fuel metaphor (oh, and I surely do), then you'll love their shop design elements, which include full-size vintage gasoline pumps and old highway maps, among other things. And their consistency is the stuff of legend – I've simply never had a bad cup of coffee here. The baristas are also folks that you can actually talk to and carry on a conversation with and not feel weird or out-hipstered. The best soy latte in town, hands-down. And don't forget to try a High 5 Pie when you visit!

A great fusion of gourmet French bistro with Seattle's coffee culture. Talk about authenticity, even the \"All employees must wash their hands\" sign is in French! So when the urge strikes for a croque monsiuer/madame to go along with your cafe au lait, this is the place for you! And while the coffee is exquisite, the real treat here is the food. From pain au chocolat to generous portions of French onion soup, to the very best frites in the city, this place is a hit with Seattle natives and tourists alike. Web site http://cafepresseseattle.com/home/ Street address 1117 12th Avenue Seattle, WA 98122 Hours 7:00am-2:00am Distance from MozCon 1.3 miles, 29 minutes Note: this stretches the definition of \"walkable\".

But what a sheer delight it is – a coffee roaster's coffee roaster – coffee served with pride by the very same people who roast it. And you know Lighthouse Coffee is good because it's served all over the region, even as far away as the islands. What's so surprising to me is the low cost – pound for pound (errr, drip for drip?) Lighthouse has the highest quality-to-price ratio in the city. But they don't skimp on experience; either of the coffee itself or the experience of drinking it in a large, open cafe that also has a working roaster on display. The decor is minimal, but the coffee is rich and complex and the baristas are more than happy to fill the open cafe space with talk of their craft. If you feel like getting away from downtown and exploring the neighborhoods of Seattle, put Lighthouse at the top of your list! And after visiting, it's just a short walk north to the Woodland Park Zoo. Web site http://www.lighthouseroasters.com/ Street address 400 N. 43rd St. Seattle, WA 98103 Hours 6:00am-7:00pm Distance from MozCon 3.6 miles Note: you should bus, cab, or drive to this location.

An ethical, sustainable company, Stumptown supports organic coffees in a Direct Trade model that helps ensure that the people growing and producing beans are paid fairly and treated well. So when you buy from Stumptown, you can feel good about your purchase. And the sheer amount of unique varietals will blow you away: you can find coffee from Timor, Ethiopia, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru, and more. You'll want to buy a bag of each to take home with you until you notice the price/pound. But don't be fooled: you will definitely get what you pay for, so it's worth splurging. The roast quality is among the best in the region; I've never had a bad bag or cup here. Along with Fonte (#9 above), Stumptown also made Rand's list. Web site http://stumptowncoffee.com/ Street address 616 E.

The owner literally wrote the book on professional espresso preparation. Coffee in Seattle simply does not get any better than Vivace. That moment when I have to duck out of the Westin for something \"work-related\"? It's a bald-faced lie; I'm actually headed over to Vivace for the best coffee in the city. Their scientific attention to detail and flavor is legendary, so much so that they'll even offer you advice on how best to actually drink your coffee in order to achieve the fullest experience. And be sure to catch a glimpse at the foam on your cappucino and the crema on your espresso shot – it's the art of perfection. And if all that's not enough for you, Vivace is located right across the street from the REI Seattle Flagship Store. So you can slam down a doppio espresso and then climb our Pinnacle wall... if you dare! Web site http://www.espressovivace.com/ Street address 227 Yale Avenue N.
