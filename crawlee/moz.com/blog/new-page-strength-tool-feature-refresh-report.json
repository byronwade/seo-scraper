Table of Contents Copied! O By: Oatmeal April 27, 2007 New Page Strength Tool Feature: Refresh Report SEO Tools The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. I've added a feature to the Page Strength tool that allows you to do a hard refresh of the data in your report. If you run a report and data is missing try refreshing it and it'll look for factors that were missing and attempt to fetch them again. Please keep the following in mind: Refreshing will only re-fetch data that is missing, not data that is inaccurate. If our tool is reporting 3,000 backlinks but clicking the Yahoo site explorer link reports 4,000 - the tool will not attempt to fetch this data again if you issue a refresh request. Also, don't assume our numbers are inaccurate because they don't match what site explorer says. Yahoo's numbers go up and down constantly, so what our tool sees and what you see when viewing through your browser may differ from day to day. Don't go refresh crazy. I avoided adding this feature for a long time because I was concerned it would consume too many resources on our server and bring the overall quality of reporting down. We've added an extra server today, however, and I'm hoping the extra hardware will allow me to keep this feature open to the public. Please be courteous and don't refresh every report you run a bunch of times, I'm going to keep this feature open to the public as long as our server can handle it. If it becomes too much I'm going to restrict it to premium members only. If you haven't read the Page Strength FAQ, please do. It'll save me from having to answer a few hundred emails. Also, The Keyword Difficulty Tool is open to the public again. I had to temporarily restrict the usage of this tool to premium members because it was too taxing on our server. Copied! Back to Top",
