Find out how to use ChatGPT to help you build out a customer journey for your website in this Whiteboard Friday episode with Grace Frohlich. Click on the whiteboard image above to open a high-resolution version in a new tab! Hi, friends. Welcome to another episode of Whiteboard Friday. My name is Grace Frohlich, and I am an SEO consultant at Brainlabs. Today I will show you how to use ChatGPT to build out a customer journey for your online search. Get into the mindset of your audience The aim of creating this journey is to get into the mindset of your audience because we want to know how our customers think and behave. This will help us meet them at key search moments. Traditionally, to build a user journey, you need customer insights, like surveys, focus groups, and interviews. But sometimes, you don't have access to this data. But if you don't have access to this data, you can use this process to help you build out the customer journey. The output will be a spreadsheet with a full user journey. Now let's start. Users search online for answers to solve their problems. What we want to know are users' motivations for searching and pain points while they're searching, and we want to know what these are at every stage and moment of the user journey. In our journey, the motivations here will map to journey stages, and the pain points will map to milestones. Milestones are the key search moments during a user's search, sort of like touchpoints, and they are nested under the journey stage. Use ChatGPT to get your journey stages Next, we'll use ChatGPT to get our journey stages. Come up with a prompt We're going to need a prompt. We want to include two key things in the prompt to generate a list of motivations. First, we want to know the type of business, and we want to know key products and services. So, for example, let's say you own a home cleaning business. In your prompt, include home cleaning services. Then ask ChatGPT, \"What are the key motivations when users search for home cleaning?\" List of motivations ChatGPT will respond with a list of motivations. So this list includes customized services, time constraints, special occasions, etc. Copy and paste your list into a spreadsheet under Stages. List of pain points Next we'll ask about pain points for this specific user journey stage. Think of it as a follow-up question. Let's choose customized services. We'll ask ChatGPT, \"I want to learn more about this specific motivation. What are the most common pain points for users?\" And again, it will respond with a list of pain points, and this list includes pet-friendly services, health concerns, preference for eco-friendly services, etc. Again, copy and paste this list of pain points into your spreadsheet under Milestones. Now we have one journey stage, which is customized services, and a list of milestones that sit under that stage. Next, you'll go back and repeat this whole process for all of your motivations and pain points. Full user journey in a spreadsheet Once you've done that, you'll have a full user journey in a spreadsheet, with stages and milestones.
