Table of Contents Copied! By: Rand Fishkin December 8, 2006 Peeking Inside the Google Engineers' Toolbox Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Ever since I first saw Matt Cutts, Google's head of search quality, \"investigating\" sites through his super-secret application (during an SES conference in NYC); calling out spammers and identifying crawl and ranking issues for curious site owners, I've wondered about the content of his tool collection. What secrets can Googlers pull up on command? How much do they really know about you, your sites and the web? In order to answer these questions, I've put together my own speculative guide about the features, operations and data points available to Mr. Cutts and his team, along with my guess about the relative liklihood that each element is actually available on demand (high, moderate or low probability). All the things that could be in a Googler's toolbox (in Rand's opinion): General Site Data How many pages Google estimates you have plus how many they've crawled and indexed | HIGH Crawl rates for your site and how often they think you update your content in various sections | HIGH Registration date and first-crawled date | HIGH Server codes your pages return (or have returned in the past) - 200s, 404s, 301s, 302s, 500s, etc. and any server errors or crawl problems Google's encountered | HIGH Anything you've submitted to Google's Webmaster Central (aka sitemaps) | HIGH Any bans, penalties or \"red flags\" Google has given the site | HIGH Domains/pages that have been 301/302'd to your site | HIGH An estimate of visitor traffic to your site in total (I'd think it would be easy for the search giant to use analytics data and compare that against their own search data and toolbar information to come up with a good formula for virtually any site - they almost certainly beat the pants off Alexa) | MODERATE How well you rank for specific terms | MODERATE An estimate of how much traffic Google sends to your site | LOW Any advertising you buy/sell through Google (Adwords & AdSense accounts) | LOW The top search terms that bring your site traffic | LOW Site Owner Information How many sites you (or entities sharing your name, phone number, address or other registration data) own and what number of these are active | HIGH Length of domain registration | HIGH Where your domains are hosted | MODERATE Adsense/Adwords accounts you run or have access to (via the Google universal login protocol) | MODERATE Analytics, Toolbar, Sitemaps, Web Accelerator or other Google accounts you might have/use | LOW IP addresses from which you've logged into a Google service | LOW Link Information Complete list of sites and pages on the web link to your site | HIGH Pagerank data, probably with additional components that weren't in the original formula | HIGH Percentage of your links that come from suspected manipulative sources (paid links, linkfarms, comment spam, ad networks, etc.) | HIGH Complete list of links to other sites/pages from your domain | HIGH Quality, trust, authority and relevance of sites you link out to | HIGH Where the majority of links point (home page, internal pages, a few particularly popular pages, etc.) | MODERATE Temporal data on links - the rate at which new links are coming to your site now and what those rates looked like in the past | MODERATE Variation of anchor text in links that point to your site | MODERATE Percentage of your links that come from blogs, wikis, forums, guestbooks or other potentially self-created sources | LOW Historical Data Historical PageRank data | HIGH Site ownership/registration changes in the past | HIGH If/when any of Google's algorithmic updates affected your site's rankings/traffic/crawl-rate (this would be a great signal to help identify why your site might have been penalized as the various updates all had particular foci) | HIGH How well you've ranked in Google over time | MODERATE Hosting/IP changes your site has made over time | MODERATE Historical traffic levels to your site | LOW What do you think?
