By: Scott Willoughby June 26, 2008 Whiteboard Friday - Stealth Reputation Management with Will Critchlow The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. This week SEOmoz Global Associate, Will Critchlow, talks about one of his many areas of expertise: Reputation Management. We're not talking about press releases and public statement, this is about controlling the SERPs, stealth style. Whether you're playing offense or defense, controlling the search results for yourself or your clients can be an extremely important part of presenting a positive image. Will discusses how you can work behind the scenes with content that already exists to help spin the picture the engines can paint. One obvious area where this can be extremely important is the political arena, where candidates live and die by public information and fragile image campaigns. And nowhere is dirt slung faster and more furiously than online. Will was recently interviewed by 'Total Politics' magazine about the subject of political rep management online and his company, Distilled, recently launched a new service targeted specifically at Political Reputation Management.
