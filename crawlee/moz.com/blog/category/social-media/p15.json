  "content": "D By: DavidHorne May 8, 2009 The Right Way to Leverage Social Media Social Media Sometimes the best way to understand how to work in a new industry is to reflect on how the industry has affected us in the past. Let's take a step forward in Social Media Marketing by taking a step backwards first. The most important question to ask yourself is: What \"Advertising Stunts\" do I remember from social websites? Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 6, 2009 Is Social Media Marketing Illegal? Social Media The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) has some rules about online marketing that may surprise you - they certainly surprised me. Recently, SEOmoz's own Sarah Bird was interviewed by Eric Enge on a wide variety of contract and legal topics. As I was proudly browsing th... Read this post By: Marta Turek May 5, 2009 'Putting Out' to 'Score' on Social Media Social Media A recent post on Mashable attempts to develop a case for utilising a candidate’s social media footprint to determine their eligibility for the applied role. The post asserts that if you do not have an expanded and publicly available \"social media footprint,\" you are at a serious disadvantage in the recruitment process to other, more candid candidates. It recommends the creation of fully updated LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter profiles and to “shed your preconceived notions of keeping your work and home life separate.” Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 4, 2009 Getting Honest About Social Media Marketing Social Media Tonight, I'm throwing out a hypothesis about social media participation & social media marketing: The majority of marketers who engage in social media do so NOT because it produces greater ROI (professionally), but because the metrics are more immediately tangible and emotionally rewarding. ... Read this post J By: Jim Keller April 27, 2009 Social Media and the Future of Customer Relations Social Media Recently, I’ve been doing quite a bit of reading and discussing the question of “What’s next?” in terms of social media, online brand strategy, and the Internet as a whole. There are many different, compelling opinions about what the future holds for our beloved World Wide Web, but I’ve found myself commonly summing up my own thoughts as follows: “more information, faster.” Read this post L By: LucyLangdon April 27, 2009 How To Make Your Offline Presence Work For You Online Social Media I was recently working on a social media strategy for a popular city newspaper and it got me thinking about the benefits a business can get from a well-thought out crossover between its offline and online presence. I've tried to write this post so that it's useful for any sized business that has some kind of offline presence, from a shop, through a publication to any kind of offline advertising or PR. If you're spending money offline, you should consider how that investment can be taken advantage of online. Read this post By: pbhj April 15, 2009 Die Digg-Bar Die, Die! (or Should You Kill the Digg Bar on Your Website) Social Media You'll have noticed that Digg has recently added the Digg-bar as a central feature, if not the main feature of their social media website. TechCrunch's discussion has a good range of comments from all sides. Having read a few such discussions, used Digg and developed a frames jail-break plugin to release my pages from Digg's grip, I thought my first YOUmoz post was due with my reflections on the use and abuse, hits and misses of the Digg-bar. Read this post A By: AnnLuck April 14, 2009 Social Media and Ethics for Small Businesses Social Media I would like to see some more discussion about Social Media Rules and Ethics. I work for a small company which is open to social media, but we don't entirely get it. We attempted a social media campaign last year, but after a few months of work it slowly fizzled into just me posting a few pictures on Flickr every week. One of the major problems has been knowing when and where we could actually promote our products. We thought we were playing by the rules, but a few sites/people called us out as marketers. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 12, 2009 Social Media Marketing: What is Your Goal? Social Media Tonight, I'm wondering why you engage in social media marketing - is it personal, on behalf of your company (or clients), or some combination of the two? Why do you have social media accounts? What do you use them for? Note that you can choose multiple answers: Read this post By: Darren Slatten April 10, 2009 Twitter Impacts Relevance Like I Impact Gravity Social Media I am awestruck by the collective nonsense I'm reading on this page. You people need a serious reality check. Even if Twitter was big enough to significantly influence search engine rankings--which it definitely ISN'T--it would still be nothing more than a noisy stream of garbage data, being produced by a very narrow range of internet users. Read this post D By: Daniel Allen April 6, 2009 Twitter is Email Marketing 2.0 Social Media There still seems to be hesitation by some industry professionals to jump on the Twitter bandwagon because they don’t yet understand its value. They don’t see a bottom-line altering reason to devote manpower and resources into building up Twitter followers and starting to tweet. While the uses of Twitter are as varied as the number of members, to those professionals, I would like to present the case that Twitter can be considered and used as Email Marketing 2.0. Read this post By: Dan Petrovic April 1, 2009 Viral Marketing Tips and Examples Social Media Viral marketing. We've seen it, enjoyed it, passed it on, and thought, “I could do something like this for my clients.” Most of us, however, do not pass the “I could” stage while others experiment with varying degrees of success. One thing is for sure, a well-executed viral marketing campaign can have a profound effect on traffic and branding. This post will reflect on main characteristics of successful campaigns and cover observations with two successful viral content experiments. Read this post A By: Andrew Steel March 25, 2009 Twitter - An Effective Marketing Tool for Business? Social Media The Twitter debate has been raging for quite some time now and I have seen and heard more than a few folk claim that they generate a lot of business from it; however, there has been very little information on the actual (as in tangible, monetary) value of the application to companies rather than sole traders. Read this post S By: Sameer Fadnavis March 18, 2009 Effective Linkbaiting and 48 Hours Can Drive Your Website Viral Social Media Linkbaiting is one of the most universally effective tactics for promoting a site, both for search engine rankings and short-term traffic boosts. I remember Rand Fishkin saying these words in a guest post on Search Engine Journal way back in 2005. Even today, linkbaiting proves to be an effective way for attracting more eye balls to your website and becoming the center of attraction. Read this post",
