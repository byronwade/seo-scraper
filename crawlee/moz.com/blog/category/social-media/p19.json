  "content": "By: Jane Copland June 10, 2008 Mintel on Social Networking and Viral Marketing Social Media There is plenty to read about social media online, but rarely do I come across something that I find really interesting or even particularly believable. On any given day, you can wade through a mass of blog posts and articles about new tools with which to waste time on Twitter. I know how to waste time on Twitter. I do it all the time. Read this post By: Danny Dover June 3, 2008 Social Media Gamblers: Learn to Play the Odds Social Media Creating viral content for social media is always a gamble. Seemingly great pieces can unexpectedly flop while poorly written blog posts and strange images can go viral without any effort from the creator. In most ways, the success of viral marketing is out of the hands of the marketers. Yet, smart marketers, just like smart gamblers, know there are certain things they can do to help their chances... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley May 28, 2008 No, Unfortunately Digg Doesn't Know Who You Are Social Media As you fully know, this week we launched the 2008 Web 2.0 Awards. Like last year and the year before, the awards were met with praise and kudos (good job, Jane and crew), and the page was submitted to Digg in hopes of making the home page. Jane and Rand sent out some tweets and commented on the blog post, urging various colleagues and users to digg t... Read this post By: Jane Copland May 27, 2008 SEOmoz's 2008 Web 2.0 Awards: The Results Social Media To quote our fantastic CTO Jeff Pollard, we're live. Two years after SEOmoz's first Web 2.0 Awards launched, we've finally finished compiling, ranking and awarding hundreds of websites across forty-one categories. We've added new categories and removed outdated ones. We've also again teamed with a great group of bloggers, marketers, and w... Read this post By: Jane Copland May 21, 2008 A True Story Social Media If you take any interest in Sphinn and the debates which rage therein, you properly noticed last week's uproar over linkbait specialist Lyndon Antcliff's fake story that ended up being mentioned on Fox News. We've dabbled in a fair few linkbait projects over the years and since the Sphinn discussion was still alive just two days ago, I don't think it's t... Read this post By: Glen Allsopp May 18, 2008 You Don't Own Your Brand Online...But You Can Own the Search Results Social Media There are over 200 million blogs online, thousands of review sites, sites specific to leaving feedback about companies and thousands of forums on any topic imaginable.People can talk about whatever they want, pretty much wherever they want, and with so many people \"conversing online\" a lot of that conversation is involving brands - their products, their services and their busin... Read this post K By: Kate Morris May 13, 2008 Social Marketing and Web 2.0: It's About Passion Social Media A true question:\"How do you create a community/forum to start? I am in the mortgage business and wondering if I were to start something like that, how I would go about getting people there.\" That prompted a debate about how to get a community going. Buying the community, starting off in other communities and luring people over, making up ide... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley May 9, 2008 Digg Has Shout-Blocked Me Social Media I've been shout-neutered, folks, and it ain't cool. Let me explain. Yesterday I submitted a story to Digg. I didn't expect it to get on the home page, but I had an \"Oh well, what the hell\" mentality about it. My plan was to do the usual--shout it once and call it a day. After I submit a link to Digg, I typically shout the story to my friends in about three waves. You can o... Read this post By: Jane Copland May 7, 2008 Customer Service Protocol 101: The Revised Edition Social Media I apologise for another Facebook-centred post, but something interesting happened to me this week. I also realise that it is a bit strange to title an original post, \"The Revised Edition,\" but this is indeed a complete re-write of my first draft. My initial post was titled, \"Cusomter Service Protocol 101: Threaten To Ban Your Most Loyal Users\" and it was quite the diatribe. You see, on Monday Facebook threatened to ban me. They said I had been caught spamming. I became very angry, as I hadn't spammed anyone. I'm also one of Facebook's biggest fans in an environment where everyone has something bad to say about the company. Read this post B By: Brent Payne May 5, 2008 My Five Favorite Things About Twitter Social Media I setup my Twitter account in April 2008 to see for myself whether Twitter was worth its weight. I initially setup Twitter just for the web but that wasn’t very engaging. I then set it up for my phone and that was too engaging for my lifestyle (plus I don’t have an unlimited texting plan). I finally decided to choose the IM option and to turn ‘devices ... Read this post By: Jane Copland April 30, 2008 Facebook Does Keyword Research Social Media If I had been paying attention on April 15th, instead of swanning around New Zealand, I would have noticed that Facebook had launched what amounts to an elementary keyword research tool... and as I write that, I realise that Facebook Lexicon is perhaps less elementary than some of the tools that we already pay for. An anonymous aggregation of \"public and semi-public\" keywords from across... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley April 30, 2008 Is Social Media Marketing Right For You? Social Media Last week on The Office, corporate weenie Ryan visited the Scranton branch and told them that they needed to make up extra sales that their website should have brought in. He had been fervently pushing the website onto the staff, telling them that version 2.0 of the site will be even bigger and better, and that embracing new technology like online sales will skyrocket paper purchases and make thei...

I'm so proud.If you want to make sure I totally ignore your Twitter follow request, please: Make sure you're following at least 5,000 people, but have only 100 followers.Have at least 10 of your last 15 posts deal exclusively with Toshiba television sets, pirated software or discount perscription... Read this post By: Jane Copland April 24, 2008 Holy Mother of Linkbait Social Media This past Tuesday night (and, eventually, Wednesday morning), Rand and I sat down and \"wrote\" a post that we were quite sure was rather amusing. Admittedly, posting to a widely read SEO blog after getting little sleep and consuming three beers and two cocktails isn't advisable. We were, however, relatively sure we were on to something good.
