Social Media Yesterday, as I was checking stats of a website that I manage, I decided to take a closer look at the bounce rate and percentage of new visitors. The bounce rate wasn't hateful (39%), but could definitely be improved. Realizing that this site gets lots of StumbleUpon traffic, I wondered if the (higher than desired) bounce rate could be due to random traffic from SU. Fortunately,... Read this post By: Mani Karthik February 21, 2008 Social Media and SEO Social Media Social Media seems to be current \"happening thing\". Everyone is asking the questions - \"Are you on XYZ?\" (XYZ being replaced by the newest social media network) and \"How many profile have you got?\" It's all the bandwagon effect. You jump in because your friend already has. Otherwise you don't really bother. But apart from all the hype,...

Social Media \"Avoid tricks,\" Google says, \"intended to improve search engine rankings.\" Of course, they don't mean it, or else we'd all be out of a job. When we explain what we do to people, we tend to use words like \"tactics\", \"methods\" and \"strategies.\" The Search Engine Strategies Conference and Expo is currently taking place in London. Search Engin... Read this post B By: brenda2179 February 20, 2008 Viral Marketing at the Grass Roots Level Social Media Here is my current theory on Viral Marketing:The whole point of \"social media marketing\" is to get people to promote your site by tagging it so other people will look at it too. Getting people to spread your info/promote your brand is a very basic definition of viral marketing (word-of-mouth, not actually new). You don't have to have write a blog or build a website o...

Its There is absolutely nothing wrong with making up new words for something that, as it stands, can't be properly named or described with existing language. Quite simply, this is how languages evolve and grow, and it would be tough to name everything with words that already exist....

Many people are adding information to this concept that I'd not yet thought of. Many people agree with me and many more... Read this post J By: justFred February 5, 2008 Do Thumbs Hold Weight? Let's Test It Social Media Does SEOMoz's Thumb system hold any weight with search engine rankings? On SEOmoz, if a blog post, a Youmoz post, or a comment had a greater number of thumbs as another identical post/comment of equal real world or \"human\" value, would the search engines know? Would they care? Wow, that's kind of a mouthful. Basically, does gi...

Read this post D By: David Naffziger January 31, 2008 Maximizing the Likelihood of Getting Dugg Social Media There has been plenty of discussion about the stories that become popular on Digg. However, these posts don't actually help the submitter that much. Do 'Microsoft' stories hit the front page frequently because there are a lot of stories submitted about Microsoft or because Diggers love Microsoft?I think it is much more useful to look at the statistics behind what does a...

Many months later - seven, in this case - the referrals from Digg, whilst having dwindled to very few, keep rolling in on a somewhat regular basis. You didn't think much of it, because you'd become accustomed to seeing that page or those pages get Digg, Stum...

Read this post By: Jane Copland January 8, 2008 It's Gonna Blow! The Critical Mass of Web 2.0 Social Media Initially, I was going to wade through all of the nominations for this year's SEOmoz Web 2.0 Awards before writing a blog post about them. Currently, I've only made it through two thirds of the entrants and I can't take any more, at least for a little while.
