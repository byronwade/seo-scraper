As a member of Generation Y who has, like many of my generational cohorts, recently advanced into the world of business (especially the business side of Social Media), I’ve noticed a few things about you all. Firstly, that you’re more social network savvy than we might have given you credit for; but secondly, that you&rsqu... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 26, 2009 Why Linkbait is a Tactic the Search Engines Will Always Value Social Media There have been more than a few debates and suppositions over the years about the potential value of linkbait/viral content strategies and whether search engines will always reward these practices. Tonight (actually, it's early morning here in Oslo), I wanted to tackle this debate and succinctly present reasons why I believe this methodology will remain powerful and effective in the long r...

And as im about to get such an education, I thought Id share what Ive found. For some time, Fullsail.com has been the only new media education player but now there are some traditional teaching institutions picking up online social media. I have given up my day job and will... Read this post By: Ed Reese August 27, 2009 My Twitter Experiment at SEOmoz Training Social Media I wasn't able to attend SMX Advanced this year. This really bummed me out. So I followed the event online and gleaned as much information as I could by following their Twitter hash tag and the multiple live bloggers at the event. It was awesome! While I would've much preferred to be in the audience, I got a ton of great information from the event from the comfort... Read this post C By: Ciaran Norris July 20, 2009 SEOmoz: It's Like A Digital Florida Social Media The golden rule when it comes to social media marketing, as espoused by hundreds of 'social media gurus' (you can tell when someone's a guru because it says so on their Twitter profile), is to \"get to know your community\". Inspired by The Tipping Point, they'll tell you that there's great gain to be had by \"influencing the influencers\". And they're ri...

The Pursuit of the Perfect Web 2.0 Brand Name With the advent of the beautifully onomatopoeic brand name Bing into the wider web language over the last few weeks (is it a rooted in US-Italian clichés, microwave sounds, a Google-baiting acronym or some bizarre Friends reference?), we&rsquo... Read this post R By: rorycarlyle June 12, 2009 Let's Talk About My Breakfast! Social Media After a few months of working with a client, I've noticed a hard nosed kamakazi dive into social media by some of the employees there. Numerous emails were sent out alongside meeting requests that bubbled with excitement over this new found gold, \"social media.\" It's not that new. However, despite my questions towards strategy, implementation, target market, budget allocations and the like, we all were whisked away into a board room to find out how Twitter works and how we all should be Twittering about the company. Read this post I By: iGoMogul May 29, 2009 Companies Playing on the Social Media Playground Social Media In participation of Social Media Month, I thought I would highlight an article over at Mashable that fueled (ok, only sparked) some interesting conversation. Adam Ostrow at Mashable wrote an article that posited the question “Is Social Media Making Corporate Websites Irrelevant?” Read this post By: Nicole Chenet May 27, 2009 Utilizing Twitter in a Link Building Campaign Social Media When I approach a link building campaign, I generally incorporate the following strategies: * Choose an affinity – what type of sites do I want to contact for a link? * Compile a list of sites and contact information using Google * Send out emails * Follow up [I am hardcore about this – after 2 days, if I haven’t gotten a reply, you can be I’m sending a follow up email. It may drive some people crazy, but it works for me. I swear by the follow up!] Read this post By: Kandice Linwright May 26, 2009 How to Utilize Twitter Trends for Amazing Blog Traffic Social Media I know, I know, everyone is tired of hearing about Twitter and its amazingness. But what can I say, I’m a fan of being able to reach millions of people at once…for free! I’m fairly new to social media marketing, but what I’ve learned in the past few days has changed the direction of my blog topics. Read this post By: David Iwanow May 22, 2009 Do Twitter Accounts Need Scale? Social Media My Twitter account has close to 1000 followers, which is not an amazing number but still a decent enough to have an effect on referral traffic patterns (and it's a nice, even figure). So what benefit is 1000 followers to your site if you don't tweet or promote your site directly? I'm not a full-time Twitter guru, and have other accounts that I manage on behalf of clients that generate more interest, so my thought is with my own account how much traffic would I get out of people visiting my site via my profile link because they wanted to learn more about my agency? This is different to a number of Twitter accounts who actively tweet and encourage people to visit their website. I need to know the value of that profile URL for my agency. Read this post D By: Dustin Ma May 22, 2009 Social Media Sites the Future of SEO/RM or Just a Fad? Social Media Social media sites as of late seem to be a staple of search engine optimization and reputation management, but will this continue to hold true in years to come? It currently seems that one of the easiest ways to get a company/individual to the top of Google is by using social media sites. With Google's current algorithm it only makes sense to register with the popular social media sites out there because they fit the algorithm perfectly.

What the hell is that? 2. Ooh yeah, we gotta get on that and go viral! 3. I don't care what it is - how do we measure it? Read this post By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers May 12, 2009 The Real Power of Twitter Social Media I've been suppressing the urge to write this post for a while now. It's not that I don't love Twitter (I suspect my wife is a few days away from scheduling my intervention); it's just that I'm saturated by it. It's not the tweets themselves, but the incessant whining noise made up of every second-rate media personality in the world \"discovering\" Twitter on a daily basis and every self-declared \"social media guru\" regurgitating the same How to Twitter post a thousand times a week.
