I'll be speaking at the a4u Expo in London, which is aimed at affiliate marketers, but is also twinning with SES to cover search. My particular session is on social media/networks and how they are being used by brands to drive sales (my co-speaker will be looking...

And those who know me, know how addicted I am to all things facebook – I would love for it to be an all encompassing application – in fact I think facebook should have its own unique browser &n... Read this post By: Rishi Lakhani September 20, 2007 Spotting Opportunities to go Viralâ€¦ Social Media Recently this well known guy wrote this post. Its kinda like a very friendly outlook to what else you can use Google for. I must admit, in the past I have typed in telephone numbers into Google, if I received a dropped (missed) call and if they looked suspicious – saved me a few quid because some of them turned o... Read this post By: Thomas Schmitz September 18, 2007 I Need to Slow Down and Enjoy the Mealâ€¦I Mean Feed Social Media Before Google Reader came on the scene I visited SEOmoz daily. I was a voracious reader and an active commenter. I spent too much time here and kept returning multiple times a day to see if new comments had been posted. I was part of the conversation and it was grand. Then, Google Reader bit my neck like a Buffy rerun and transformed me into a lurker. Suddenly the posts were coming ... Read this post By: Rishi Lakhani September 17, 2007 Whats wrong with Facebook Groups? Social Media Now now… don’t get me wrong. I do love facebook – and all its brilliant applications and gossip value (word of mouth for the posh ones…). But…How many of us join various groups? I know I do – quite a few. I flit in and out of quite a few and stick to the interesting ones, more often than not events groups. But I believe that FB would be an ex... Read this post K By: Kat French September 14, 2007 In Moderation: Strategies for Building and Managing Online Communities Social Media While I've only been involved in web development and SEO for three years, I've been participating in online communities since 2001. Over the last six years, it's been my privilege to help build and moderate a few online communities. I've learned a lot about the way people think and behave online and picked up a few helpful bits of information--and fortunately, I like... Read this post By: Jane Copland September 13, 2007 Make Your Millions with Facebook Applications Social Media Rand, how on earth do you expect me to complete any solid keyword research when you assign me a task that involves Facebook? Luckily, you asked me to review the most successful (and most useful, as they're not necessarily the same thing) Facebook applications. I'm one of those people who have shied away from adding applications to my Facebook account because I remember when Facebook was like a ren... Read this post By: Jane Copland September 13, 2007 A Social Media Tool... That You'll Actually Use! Social Media Yesterday, I received an email from Christ Bennett at 97th Floor, telling me about an awesome tool they were due to release tomorrow (now today, obviously), that lets you tell how many times a page you're currently viewing has been submitted to / voted upon at the four biggest social media services. However, far from being just a Firefox toolbar extension, the tool also shows up on Digg, Reddit, S...

Guillaume and I got to chatting over dinner about the new version of Digg and the more prominent version of the social li... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 4, 2007 When Data Repositories Open Up, So Do Possibilities for Viral Content Social Media Gary Price of ResourceShelf dropped me a line last week with some links to very cool content repositories on the web that have recently opened up or expanded. Browsing through a few of these got me thinking that the sheer amount of information available from non-profits, organizations and government entities could make for some very powerful viral mate... Read this post By: Anthony Kirlew August 29, 2007 Search Marketing Industry Standards and Best Practices & SEO 2.0 Social Media Everyone wants the latest version of what already works. We had The Web (let’s call it Web 1.0), but it wasn’t good enough, so we came up with Web 2.0. SEO has been successful and continues to be successful for those who understand it, but it’s apparently not good enough. So now we have \"SEO 2.0\" being pushed, which is supposed to be to SEO what Web...

It's actually kind of awesome to be in such a quiet office, and it's equally pleasant not to have to pander to Rebecca's dislike of certain food groups when we ...

It's a pretty small operation right now, but basically we let artists sign up themselves to give away and/or sell their music on our site, while we collect a small royalty.
