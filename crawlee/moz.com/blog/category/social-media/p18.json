Two of the most difficult of these hurdles are \"can you guarantee results e.g. numbers of views etc....\" and \"how do we track this&quot... Read this post By: aimClear July 25, 2008 Tiers of Transparency: The Ethical Brand Ambassador Social Media In the physical world we meet people everyday who share their personal motivations (or not) on multiple levels. Some of them could be artists or even work for companies with a vested interest in our particular demographic segment. In the traditional publishing realm, authors release great works under pseudonyms and even have teams of associate writers compose large chunks or whole books. In man...

The two current solutions on adding your friends to new socials networks are:Manually search for your friends on every new network you join. T... Read this post By: Jane Copland July 9, 2008 Taking Note Of Competitors' Mistakes & Successes Social Media Quite often, people ask me this, either to my face, via Q&A or in emails: how do I come up with truly unique, never-before-seen, shiny new ideas? What a question. It's a rare thing to come up with something that's really never been done before. Many of the novels on a bookstore's shelves contain stories that have been told before in one form or another. Real originality is fantastic, but there is plenty to be made from taking a good idea and putting a new spin on it and making it better. Read this post T By: Tom Critchlow July 9, 2008 Treat Me Mean, I Need The Reputation Social Media There's been a fair amount of buzz recently about online reputation management and how to do it. One thing which I think has been missing from the discussion however is looking at the different ways a negative reputation can manifest itself online. After all, not all negative reputations are created equal. Sometimes it's a page that looks innocuous but contains mildly negative negative things once... Read this post By: Danny Dover July 2, 2008 Reddit, Stumbleupon, Del.icio.us and Hacker News Algorithms Exposed! Social Media It is greatly ironic that algorithms, the quintessential example of all that is not human, would be so fundamental to social media. Last week I wrote a post about how Google gathers user data. This week I continue by exposing how popular social media websites use algorithms to ut... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley July 1, 2008 An Initial Review of Boudica, the Social News Site for Women Social Media Danny Sullivan's lovely wife, Lorna (who lent me a hat and gloves when we went to see Stonehenge on an especially cold, windy day), recently created Boudica, a social news site for women. The site is pretty new and is currently in Beta testing mode, but I thought I'd give an initial review of things thus far. I'll start with the following caveat: I'm not super...

Social Media After reading Ciaran's excellent post \"A Few Things That Irk Me About Plurk,\" I made the offhand comment that if I were going to abandon Twitter (or it, as seems more likely, Twitter's technical problems result in a final, Hindenburg-like crash) I would most ... Read this post C By: Ciaran Norris June 17, 2008 A Few Things That Irk Me About Plurk Social Media If you've been hanging out on Sphinn recently, or keeping up with the Twitterati, you'll no doubt have heard of Plurk. It's the latest Me 2.0 site, promising a whole new world of micro-blogging, despite sharing many features with Twitter (which, I guess is now officially SOOOO 2007). Muhamma... Read this post M By: mystery_guest June 12, 2008 Sexism Runs Rampant on Reddit (and maybe the rest of the social web) Social Media I am conflicted. I'm in an abusive relationship with reddit. And I keep going back, thinking I can somehow change things. I keep visiting, keep commenting, keep frantically checking my comments every hour or so to see if anyone's replied. I think if I say the magic word, somehow, things will get better. I'm addicted to it, yet I don't enjoy... Read this post",
