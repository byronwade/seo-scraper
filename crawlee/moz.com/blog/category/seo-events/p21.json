Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley March 21, 2008 Roundup Thursday for the Week of 3/16/08 SEO Events Sorry this roundup is delayed. I had the damn thing about 60% completed earlier today, but then Mel brought in a pig full of beer, which we proceeded to drink during lunch. A couple of glasses later, I returned to my desk and inadvertently hit whichever combination of keys on my keyboard is the equivalent to the \"Back\" button on my browser, thus losing my post. After work, I went to the ... Read this post By: Ian Lurie March 19, 2008 SES NY and SMX West, Compared SEO Events I've hit the circuit hard this year, and I think I can differentiate SMX and SES.No doubt, folks will get all up in arms that I'm short-changing one event or another. But from my perspective both events have compelling reasons to visit:SES NYIs a huge corporate-style trade show.Has a lot of folks trying hard to sell to each other.Gives you a g... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley March 18, 2008 Yo SMX, Where My Devs At? SEO Events Jeff, our CTO and lead developer-with-a-beard, had recently expressed to me his desire to speak at conferences and events. Fantastic! ...except for one problem. There are no developer-centric tracks at any SEO conferences. SES? Zip. SMX? Zilch. Pubcon has had a smattering of developer-related sessions that were, according to Jeff, weak sauce. SXSW is the only conference to offer developer sessions... Read this post By: Mark Hawks March 12, 2008 SMX Social in Long Beach, CA SEO Events Ok I have been living under a rock I guess because I just got an email from Third Door Media and found out that SMX Social is coming to da LBC. I have always thought that Long Beach, CA would be a great place for an SEO convention. I live downtown and I am in the industry, so it seems a little selfish, but really if I think of it from the perspective of how much fun everyone is going to hav...

Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley March 3, 2008 Booth Thoughts from Two Mozzers and an Irishman SEO Events With SMX West behind us, I thought it would be interesting to reflect back on something that we hadn't ever done at any other conference: operate a booth. I have to say that attending a conference when you have a booth is an entirely different experience than attending without one. Below I'll provide my input, Rand's thoughts, and some helpful tips from a cranky Irishman who's had plenty of experi... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley March 3, 2008 Happy Anniversary, Me! Searchfest is Next Week SEO Events Next Monday, March 10th, is Searchfest 2008, a day conference organized by SEMpdx, Portland's SEM community. I've created an event for Searchfest, so if you plan on going, sign up!... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley February 29, 2008 Generation Google a General Disappointment SEO Events This morning I went running, hopped in the shower, and ran to the conference, hair still wet, because I didn't want to miss the Generation Google panel. I was excited to hear more about Harrison Gevirtz, a sixteen year old affiliate marketer, and Chloe Spencer, Stephan Spencer's daughter and a blogger who makes a good chunk of dough from AdSense earnings. Joining the... Read this post S By: Stephen Tallamy February 28, 2008 A Day in the Life of SES London 2008 SEO Events Following on from the excellent posts by Ciarán on SES London 2008, here are my experiences of the event. I only attended the final day of the conference as it seemed to have the most relevant agenda for the areas I'm currently looking at.I was a little disappointed when I arrived as the exhibition was run only on the... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley February 27, 2008 Legal Issues, The Economics of Search, PPC Pitfalls, and the SMX Search Bowl SEO Events Yesterday I attended sessions, met some new folks, and attended Search Bowl. Below is a brief recap and my opinions of Day 1 of SMX West. Recent Legal News About Search Clarke Walton went over search ad trademark policies. Google has the easiest trademark policies to understand. They allow trademarks ... Read this post By: Jane Copland February 26, 2008 Video and Images in Search Results: SMX West SEO Events If there's one thing that doesn't seem to receive terribly much attention, it's image and video search. There has usually been a session at every conference, but images were often ignored in favour of both paid and regular organic search. Along came blended results and everybody takes more notice. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 26, 2008 A Day of Pure Insanity SEO Events I'm incredibly tired. So dead, it's hard to take out my contact lenses (you know how they stick sometimes? Yeah, I hate that). Here's a log of today's events: 7:50am - Wake up at hotel in San Francisco, shower 8:45am - Catch cab to International Orange 9:15-10:45am - Take first ever Yoga class (wow ...
