I have spent the last several weeks reading and categorizing all the blog posts written over the years on this site. It has been quite the project and has let me really experience how this company and the SEO industry as a whole have evolved. I, like the other mozzers, am a stat junkie and kept notes on notable tren... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley December 20, 2007 Thursday Roundup for the Week of 12/16/07 SEO Events It's Thursday, so you know what that means: another installment of Roundup Thursday! This week, I'm implementing a more formal layout that will be executed in every recap post from here on out. Hope you enjoy it! That being said... New Additions to the SEOmoz Marketplace: Featured job postings: ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 12, 2007 9 Must Read Stories for the Week SEO Events It's very late, and I need to be up very early, but the blog - she's a harsh mistress, so let's dive right in. Guide to Viral Marketing & Linkbait on the Web I edited this 40+ page guide just before we left for Pubcon last week and remarked to Jane (the primary&... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley December 11, 2007 What Happens in Vegas...Gets Documented in a Blog Post SEO Events It's that time again, folks--post conference \"Overheard in ________\" time (aka Kevin Gleeson's favorite post). This being my first Pubcon experience, I had plenty of quotes rolling around in my head but tried to extract the least inappropriate ones (hey, some things just need to stay [and die] in the barren Vegas desert). That being said, enjoy the best quotes I was able to remember: Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley December 10, 2007 PubCon from a Conversions Conscious Perspective SEO Events I've recently been tasked with managing our PPC campaign and working with Jeff on tweaking our landing pages in order to increase our Premium Membership conversions. This week at PubCon I attended as many conversions, PPC, and landing page-related sessions as I could to see if there were any tips or tactics I could pick up. I'd classify myself as someone who knows more than the basics about PPC an... Read this post By: MelGray December 8, 2007 A Summary & Review of My First SEO Convention SEO Events I'm typing this as I'm sitting at the departure terminal for my trip back home to Seattle. Its been quite the week, and I'm definitely feeling a bit fatigued, but saying this trip was \"worth it\", would be an understatement. This is my second time in Vegas, but first time out to a SEO convention. Being a developer I am often a bit clueless about who most of th... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley December 6, 2007 Only SEOmoz Could Make Search Spam Fun SEO Events Last night SEOmoz hosted the much-anticipated Search Spam party (much anticipated by Rand and Gillian, anyway, who have been skipping around the office like giddy little school girls the past couple weeks). Held in the room opposite the Google Meet the Engineers mixer (how very ... Read this post By: Jane Copland December 6, 2007 Blogging and Search, Video Content and The Fear SEO Events I don't know what it is about this town, but things work very differently here. I've been getting little sleep and not eating very much (aside from a trip to the Bellagio's buffet where I ate myself sick) and yet I feel fantastic. They say casinos pump oxygen into the gambling halls and bars in order to keep you awake and alert and spending money. Whatever it is, it works. This morn... Read this post J By: Jeff Pollard December 5, 2007 Some Tips from PubCon on How to Get Your Site Optimized for the Mobile Web SEO Events Being a developer, I tend to be drawn to the sessions here at PubCon that have more of a product creation and development feel. The search marketing sessions are good too, and I attend them over the entry level developer sessions, but when I go to a session my takeaway is how what I've learned can make me a better developer. Fighting lack of sleep, I attended the Local a... Read this post By: Jane Copland December 4, 2007 Oh, Vegas... SEO Events Please excuse the post's title. It's been a long day already and I'm terrible at writing titles at the best of times. From the nineteenth floor of the Wynn in Las Vegas, my fried brain decided that an off-topic title for an on-topic piece was just fine. Most of you know why we're here. It's Pubcon. This conference marks the first time I've been \"back\" to an industry event,... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 27, 2007 Werewolves, Search Spam & Custom Cards - If You Are Going to Pubcon, Do Not Miss This SEO Events Next week, at Las Vegas' Pubcon Conference, SEOmoz is throwing a whole new kind of party. In the past, we've had tons of fun playing the parlor game, Werewolf (description & rules here), with Googlers, SEOs, Black Hats & industry mavens. It's the perfect combi... Read this post By: Jane Copland November 20, 2007 Jane's Presentation from SMX London SEO Events I'm going to blatantly copy my fellow Linkbait and Viral Marketing presenter Ciarán and post my slides and notes here for you guys. What can I say. Imitation is flattering, isn't it? And the posts are a good idea: it means that you all get to hear what I said about all the slides and you don't have any irritating PowerPoint presentation to download. Because I know you all secretly ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 19, 2007 Congratulations to Epiar, Top Draw & A Roundup of the Last Week SEO Events This weekend, Mystery Guest, myself, Vanessa & Todd all hopped a flight from Seatac up to Edmonton, Alberta at the request of our dear friend, Ken Jurina. Ken's companies, Top Draw & Epiar were celebrating not only their combined 21 years in business. At 32, Ken's been able to achieve amazing things - I've written... Read this post By: Jane Copland November 18, 2007 Jane Takes on SMX London SEO Events In a couple of hours, I'll leave for Heathrow after attending the inaugural SMX London and speaking on my first session, Linkbait and Viral Marketing. And only twelve hours after I'd finally aclcimatised to the eight-hour time difference between Western Europe and the U.S.'s West Coast. That's a tough one to get used to. I did everything in my power to stay awake upon arriving in London, including... Read this post",
