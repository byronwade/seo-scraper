  "content": "By: Rand Fishkin November 5, 2006 Rand's Unofficial Guide to Speaking at SES SEO Events More than a few speakers have written to me asking about the SES conference series - how they should prepare, what they should bring, how the conference is organized for speakers, etc. There's an irony here that shouldn't be overlooked - when I was a first-time speaker (just a couple years ago), I had these same questions, and plenty of nervousness. I'm going to address this purely from an SES ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 1, 2006 Shoemoney's Elite Retreat SEO Events Jeremy, along with Aaron Wall and a couple others, has put together something called the \"Elite Retreat.\" Dave Taylor (one of the organizers) wrote a bit about the why of the conference: ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 25, 2006 A Collection of Rand's Search-Related Comics SEO Events Over the last 3 years, I've made more than 2 dozen unique presentations. Anyone who's seen these knows that one of my signatures is an attempt at humor. Occassionally successful, often dismally sad (particularly with British audiences) and universally tacky, embedded comics have been a mainstay of almost every Powerpoint I've authored. For no other reason than to share, I've collected s... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 27, 2006 A College Dropout Speaking at Stanford? SEO Events That's right folks; I've been tapped by Stanford University to participate in their Web Publishing Course on Monday, Nov. 13 & Tuesday, Nov. 14. The goal of the course is to help business owners, website managers and corporate executives learn the ins and outs of building and marketing a successful site. ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 24, 2006 What I Learned in Guelph SEO Events Last week, I spend three days on the road, visiting a client in Guelph, ON. My job was to train a staff of 20+ web publishers, designers, content creators and managers on the things that we at SEOmoz do best - viral marketing, site/content development, usability/design analysis and social media marketing. The training itself was excellent - better than many of the training sessions I've conduct... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 25, 2006 Seattle's Web 2.0 Roundtable SEO Events Last night I attended Seattle's small (but growing) Web 2.0 roundtable, hosted by the kind folks at Wetpaint. The traffic was a bit tough, due to a Mariners game across the street, but we managed to start right around 6pm and the hours flew by. The companies represented included: PayscaleTheir site isn't as \"open&... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 18, 2006 Why is Michael Martinez an SEOmoz Blogger? SEO Events During the past few months, I've received more than a few emails asking me about Mr. Martinez's position on the SEOmoz blog. At the SES conference in San Jose, a small handful asked the same question - here's the response I gave them: Michael's views and opinions are not mainstream. They don't always have the kind of logic that's easy for many of us to follow (myself included). Michael'... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 14, 2006 My Bet on WebmasterRadio SEO Events During the expo hall last Tuesday at SES San Jose, I sat down with Matt Cutts for a 5 minute, impromptu chat on the air. Foolishly, I issued a challenge that anyone who sumo-wrestled me at the WebMasterRadio party on Wednesday night (Jim's got great photos here) and won would earn the right to a free link from... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley July 14, 2006 All Play and Some Work at SES Latino SEO Events Sorry for the delay, but I didn't realize how truly indispensable I was until I left town for a few days. Once I got back it was nothing but, \"Rebecca, Rebecca, the company almost went under without you! Fix this! Help me! Where are my yellow Pumas?\" Okay, now that I'm done with my illusions of grandeur, the following is an exhaustively comprehensive recap of my trip to Miami for the ina... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 12, 2006 Speaking Sessions at San Jose SEO Events Good news on San Jose for all my conference considering amigos - SEOmoz will be completely over-represented Danny has booked me to speak on three different topics: On Monday, August 7th from 4-5:30pm, I'll be speaking on S... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 13, 2006 Bill Slawski - Interviewed SEO Events Finally, someone did an interview with one of the best and brightest in the industry. Thanks to Mr. Pratt (he's fond of that moniker, apparently), Bill Slawski, one of my favorite people, is featured today on SEOBuzzBox. I do take issue with Pratt's first statement, though: ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 31, 2006 Thanks for Dinner, Vintage Tub & Bath! SEO Events I owe a big one to Allan Dick, who bought dinner tonight for myself, Danny Sullivan, Ammon Johns, Chris Sherman and about a dozen other SESers here in London. Unbelievably, I still have not slept since Sunday night, but managed to truly enjoy the wine, crab cakes and top-notch beef and Guiness pie. In return, I thought I'd take a quick dive over to Alan's site - a veritable haven for th... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 9, 2006 SEW Live in Seattle - It's a Party! SEO Events Next Friday, in Seattle's Hotel Monaco, the SearchEngineWatch crew, including Danny Sullivan, Joseph Morin, Elisabeth Osmeloski (our esteemed organizer), Dana Melick, Heather Lloyd Martin, myself and several reps from each of the major search engines will be presenting to a small audience on SEO, SEM & website marketing. It's called ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 13, 2006 Dan Thies Goes a-Blogging SEO Events I can't believe I missed it, but as of last Friday, the SEO world's chief authority on KW Research, Dan Thies, has joined the blog ranks. His format is slightly different than most industry bloggers, providing tips and advice about the SEO process itself on a daily basis. From a recent post on ... Read this post",
