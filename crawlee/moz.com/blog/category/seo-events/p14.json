Read this post By: Jennifer Sable Lopez March 29, 2010 Where In the World is SEOmoz - April-May 2010 SEO Events Whew! The Spring conference season is in full swing, and the mozzers are coming soon to a city near you. You'll find us anywhere from Charlotte, NC to Barcelona to Singapore in the next couple months. The coolest part is that we're attending and speaking at some conferences for the very first time. It feels good to get out and stretch a bit! Plus, the developer in us will be attending conferenc...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 10, 2010 Optimizing Search Conferences: How Differing Incentives Create Audience vs. Organizer Issues SEO Events Over the past 6 years, I've attended nearly 100 conferences on search, online marketing, startups and technology. I've given presentations or sat on panels at nearly all of them. I've organized our own SEOmoz seminars here in Seattle and in London, built panels for a variety of other conference series and, in the past 3 months, had more discussions about the conference format and the optim... Read this post By: Jennifer Sable Lopez March 3, 2010 Ballmer, Sitelinks & Other Favorites from SMX West Day 1 SEO Events SMX West 2010 kicked off with quite a bang (or was that a yell?). Since Microsoft's CEO, Steve Ballmer was the keynote, people arrived early to ensure good seats. The music playing before it started was amazing, it helped to create an excitement in the room that I really had never felt before a keynote before. I had attempted to save a seat for someone up front, but there was just too much demand and had to give it up. That's the sort of thing that happens at a great concert, not a conference keynote.

It was a remarkable experience to be faced with such a different crowd than what I'm used to. As a comparison, the week prior, I'd been in Mountain View presenting to the Silicon ...

From Google SERP changes to actionable analytics insights, this week's post is full of more stuffing than Grandma's turkey. Read this post By: Jennifer Sable Lopez November 25, 2009 Favorite Tidbits from PubCon 2009 SEO Events PubCon does an amazing job of putting together a schedule that covers a multitude of tracks and topics. Unfortunately because of this I often end up with a case of \"session envy.\" You know, when you're sitting in a session and you start to see tweets about how great another session is. It doesn't even mean that the one you're in is bad, it's just that you want to be in tw...

Pubcon is coming! Pubcon is cooommiiinnnnggggg! It seems like the whole industry might just shut down for a week while we take over Las Vegas (I hope they're ready for us). This would probably be a great time for spammers to come in and take over our SERPs since we'll be busy in sessions, going to parties, meeting... Read this post By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers October 27, 2009 7 Tips for Surviving PubCon SEO Events SEO conferences can be amazing opportunities for education and networking, but to get the most out of them, you have to survive until the end. If your average SEO conference is an endurance event, then PubCon is the Iron Man – 3 full days of sessions, followed by sponsored parties, followed by being dragged around Vegas by crazy people, topped off by a full afternoon of even more drinking (j...
