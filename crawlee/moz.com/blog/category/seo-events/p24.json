  "content": "By: Jane Copland November 12, 2007 Countries That Aren't America SEO Events On Thursday and Friday of this week, Gillian and I will be attending SMX London - the SMX conference series' second European station. As opposed to the three conferences I've attended in the past (Pubcon 2006, SES New York 2007 and SMX Seattle this past June), I'm going to be taking part in a panel in London. I've mentioned this once before, but as I'm leaving tomorrow, things are about t... Read this post By: Maria S Balayan November 5, 2007 My Personal Experience at SMX Buenos Aires SEO Events I’ve been living in the US since 1999 but I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Every time I go to Buenos Aires I lose my routine of being online almost 13 hours a day. I miss the internet connection but I am able to enjoy other things like family, food, friends, and good weather (I live in Buffalo, NY, so ima... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley October 19, 2007 Closing Thoughts on SMX Social Media 2007 SEO Events I'm back in Seattle after a short trip to NYC for SMX Social Media.

He starts off with his token in-joke for French speakers. People laugh (in French: \"hoh... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley October 16, 2007 Live Blogging \"Extra! Extra! The Social News Sites\" at SMX Social Media SEO Events Having just wrapped up my presentation for Linkbait: Chumming for Traffic on Social Media Sites (I linked to Vanessa Fox's session coverage on Search Engine Land in case you want a recap), I thought I'd turn the tables and live blog Extra! Extra! The Social News sites. (Side note: My allergies have been a pain in the ass e... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley October 9, 2007 What Would You Want to Learn from a Linkbait Panel? SEO Events As Rand mentioned in his Rewriting the Beginner's Guide post, he and I will be speaking at SMX Social Media next Monday and Tuesday. Once again, I will be speaking on the Linkbait panel with my buddies Brent Csutoras and ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 3, 2007 Across the Web & A Day in the Life SEO Events I'm combining two short blogs into one tonight - hey, it's easier for you to read and me to write, so why not, right? First off, I wanted to do a roundup of some of the great material that's popped up over the past few days: Yahoo! did an impressive upgrade to their search results and the search functionality... Read this post M By: Matt Aaron October 2, 2007 Great, Fantastic, Phenomenal, Beautiful - SEOmoz Seminar Review SEO Events I feel very grateful that I was able to attend the SEOMoz seminar. I’ll spare you MOZ readers my below-average review-critic journalism and skip to the highlights:*8 hours of insight on a wide range of SEO related topics from, for my money and many others, the best SEO in the world. He is also a fantastic speaker. I also came to the conclusion that Rand is better suited... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley September 21, 2007 Advanced Web 2.0 at the Shop.org Summit SEO Events Earlier this week I was in Las Vegas to attend and speak at the Shop.org Summit. While I was there I attended the \"Web 2.0: Advanced Level\" session. After some severe sound issues (think microphones cutting out and constant screechingly loud feedback) and my astonishment at how much wifi costs in the convention ce... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley September 7, 2007 Mentally Check Out with the SES San Jose Comic Strip SEO Events Now that I've got about a week's worth of antibiotics pumping through my system (only one more week to go!), I was able to focus my valuable SEO skills on creating a litany of stupid speech bubbles and images of Dave Naylor saying \"fookin.\" I think I may be underpaid. Anyway, thanks for being patient while my body became a culture of snot and goo. Here's the ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 3, 2007 Industry Numbers, SEOmoz Stats & the New York Social Media Event SEO Events So much to fit into one blog post (and technically, I'm still on vacation). Technically, this is three separate subjects, so I'll segment :) Industry Numbers For the outside investment we're seeking, I've had to dig around a bit for industry data to help predict the total number of people in the world conducting search marketing professionally - here's what I've ... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley August 28, 2007 The Pros and Cons of Public Speaking SEO Events I had the opportunity to speak about link bait at this year's SES San Jose. It was my fourth speaking engagement, and I potentially have at least two more speaking gigs lined up before the end of the year (the Shop.org Summit in Las Vegas September 17-19 and hopefully ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 27, 2007 Rand on the Hotseat SEO Events Have I been captured by enemy blackhats? Tortured and thrown to the dogs? Or just relentlessly interviewed over email (and in person)? Well, since the first two sound painful, let's go with door number three. First off is an interview on social media marketing, with a few nifty... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley August 24, 2007 Whaddya Say, San Jose? SEO Events Ah, San Jose. Your city may be boring and somewhat bland, but your conference is always a fun time.
