Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley October 17, 2008 Pre-Weekend Roundup for the Week of 10/12/08 SEO Events Since I've caught the awesome cold that's been running rampant through our office, I was unable to publish the roundup yesterday. As such, I'm publishing it today as a temporary \"Pre-Weekend Roundup.\" Now you'll have something fun to read on your lazy Saturday morning! Aren't I thoughtful... Stories, news, and other notable items from the past week: * TechRadar has a list of 20 websites that changed the world and revolutionized the way we lead our lives.

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 12, 2008 6 Lessons from the Search Engineers at SMX East SEO Events During the final day of SMX East, Nick and I sat in a fascinating session where search engineers from Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft all answered questions posed by the audience and filtered by moderator, Danny Sullivan. I have, in my 5 years of search conferences, attended numerous sessions like this, but I must say that this was, if not the best one I've attended, very close to it. The question... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley October 9, 2008 Roundup Thursday for the Weeks of 9/28/08 and 10/5/08 SEO Events My apologies for the missing roundup last week--I got a lot of panicked emails from folks who were afraid that Thursday Roundups were killed off along with our old site design. Not the case--blame the missing roundup on our last-minute scramble to get Linkscape all shiny and purdy for our launch. Never fear, however: this week the roundup is back in action (also, expect my triumphant retur...

Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley August 28, 2008 Roundup Thursday for the Week of 8/24/08 SEO Events Stories, news, and other notable items from the past week: Three star links: Over on Graywolf's blog, Joe Hall talks about web 2.0 real estate innovators foreclosing some pain on old school real estate brands. Sites like Zillow and Trulia.com are having an open house of ass whooping, and Remax and Century 21 are invited! (If I think of any other real estate-related puns, I'll let you know.) The Google Webmaster Central blog answers your burning questions about 404s. I actually picture people being kept awake at night because they don't know how Google treats a 410 status code. That's sad.

Warning: the questions are uber-geeky and pretty quantitative/logic-heavy. * Speaking of nerd alert, here's the linear algebra behind search engines. Geez, my head hurt just typing that. * The O'Reilly Radar asks if linking to yourself is the future of the web. The post has two good recommendations for self-linkers, so be sure to check 'em out.
