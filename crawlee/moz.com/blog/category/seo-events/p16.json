  "content": "By: Jennifer Sable Lopez August 13, 2009 Best Thing About Search Conferences SEO Events Every search conference is usually filled with sessions, keynotes, site reviews, clinics, etc. If you're not at the conference you can usually follow the blogs and Twitter to get your daily dose of conference fare. These help keep you up-to-date on the sessions and general goings on.

There were a number of debates, someone was found sleeping in the first row drooling and another person claimed that most people at the session were probably already following him on Twitter. Read this post By: Jennifer Sable Lopez August 11, 2009 SES San Jose Day 1 - Overheard on Twitter SEO Events This week I'm at SES San Jose covering the conference for SEOmoz. I'm a one woman show so I'm putting my multi-tasking skills to the test! Obviously I can't make it to every session, or cover every track. Plus there are many others live blogging the event. So, how can I make sure the SEOmoz community gains as much information as possible from this conference? Reuse other people's content, that's h...

Well it IS summer time again, and this year there are some interesting (both national and global) summer online marketing conferences happening. Some of the mozzers will be attending and/or speaking and I thought this was a great time to let everyone know where we'll be, and in some cases, where we'd like to be! Online Marketing Su...

This may sound strange coming from a Spaniard, but after I have lived abroad... Read this post By: Jennifer Sable Lopez June 16, 2009 Jane and Robot Search Developer Summit SEO Events Last Friday I attended and spoke at the Jane and Robot Search Developer Summit in San Francisco. The idea of the conference was to cover technical SEO topics and help train developers and others. The 100 attendees (or so) were a mixed bunch; developers, SEOs, managers and the like. The sessions covered site archit...

I had a really lovely time exploring the beautiful city as well as speaking at IMC and networking with marketers from all over the world. I thought I'd provide a recap of my trip and share some conference coverage with all of you who didn't attend the conference but are curious as to what it entailed. Enjoy! Pre-...

Read this post S By: StatMatt June 1, 2009 Getting Value from Search Conferences SEO Events I've just got back from SMX London (when I say \"just\" I'm obviously referring to the Hangover, as I've been back multiple days), and It's probably the best event I've been to for all around value and enjoyment. Having to been to several conferences (Including 3 SES events) over the years though, I've come to the conclusion that, unless you are networking for clients, these events are not easy to justify the expenditure they incur. The problem most people in the intermediate-advanced tier face is hearing only what we know already; I spend a lot of these sessions sucking eggs now. Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley May 15, 2009 Weekend Roundup for the Week of 5/10/09 SEO Events Stories, news, and other notable items from the past week: Google crashed between 8:40 and 9:55 ET yesterday, preventing people from Googling to find out why Google wasn't working. Oh noes! Speaking of Google, they recently overhauled Google News as well as updated their blog search algorithm, and they're allowing trademarks to be used in US Adwords copy. Geez, no wonder there was downtime. Methinks Google needs a little R&R.

You know what that means: it's conference season! Since there are so many conferences right around the corner, I thought I'd list some upcoming events in case you're thinking of attending a show but aren't sure which one to book.
