Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 15, 2007 Mozzers Run Off to Paris, Leaving Rand Sick, Mute & Troubled SEO Events Yesterday around 5pm, I noticed myself getting sick - I had a run in with Dax from Webguerrilla, who had just come back from the London Free Clinic, where he was told that he \"had a virus. Nothing to do but wait... Sorry old chap.\" Now I've got the bloody infection, have lost my voice, am speaking on the analytics panel in a few hours and woke up to find this note on Scott's bed: ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 14, 2007 Reporting Live from SES London SEO Events London's been a bit of whirlwind for all of the mozzers. My first two nights here featured the same thrilling insomnia that characterized my last visit to London - remember these? Luckily, at this point, I'm well rested and able to cognitiv... Read this post I By: IgorMordkovich February 13, 2007 Poor Speakers at SES, PubCon and Other Search Marketing Conferences SEO Events As I attend multiple search marketing related conferences and trade shows (SES, PubCon, etc.) every year, I always take a closer look at the speakers and how they present the information. One might put you to sleep while another gets you going as if you just drank 3 cans of Red Bull (peace of garbage in my opinion). Anyway, I know it’s easy to critique when you&rsq... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 6, 2007 Big News & Little News SEO Events Yesterday brought us the biggest news the SEO world has had in sometime - Google's Webmaster Central is showing relatively accurate and complete link data. When stacked against Yahoo!'s Site Explorer, this stuff looks pretty amazing. Webmasters are going to find themselves with a lot more link anal... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 30, 2007 Elite Retreat & Competition SEO Events The team behind the Elite Retreat conference series has been diligently requesting some press coverage of their San Francisco event in March. I have to say that I'm extremely impressed to hear that they've recruited Guy Kawasaki to speak, and certainly the speakers themselves (Aaron Wall, Darren ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 6, 2007 A Bet on Today's Seahawks-Cowboys Matchup SEO Events My friend Joe Morin, official party coordinator of the SES & Pubcon conferences and all-around behind-the-scenes guru of the search marketing world has made a bet with me. In 16.5 hours, my Seattle Seahawks will be battling Joe's beloved Dallas Cowboys (see photos from the last matchup) for a chance to go to Chicago/New Orleans fo... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 3, 2007 Jim Christy - The Pentagon's Internet Crime Fighter and Matt Cutts - Google's Search Spam Crime Fighter SEO Events While reading Wired's recent article about Jim Christy - the \"government's original geek with a gun,\" I couldn't help but be stunned by the similarities to one of our industry's own members.. yes, search blogger of the year, and BFF of Rebecca, ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 14, 2006 SES Chicago Recap in Comics SEO Events We noticed that at the last few SES & Pubcon conferences, the coverage has been overwhelming. You can't say a word or show a slide without finding it 3 hours later all over the search blogosphere. So... we wanted to do something a little different for our coverage. Let's see how Incisive likes giving out press passes to young women whose primary form of journalism is done in the classi... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 5, 2006 More Hot Topics from Chicago SEO Events This event is fast and furious, so I've got to keep it in list format again: Apparently, I was wrong about Todd Malicoat - he has a crush on me (pictures to prove this later), not Lisa Barone. On the female side of the aisle, there is a girl that he's devoted to, but she's not at the conference... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley December 2, 2006 My Experience as a Fresh Egg Intern SEO Events Huzzah, hooray! I've managed to get this article up before Rand and I have to leave for SES Chicago. Apparently Ammon and Co. in the UK have been waiting for me to put it up \"with bated breath.\" So, for the sake of Ammon's lungs, I thought I'd stop messing around and get to business.Anyway, as most of you probably know, I interned with Fresh... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 28, 2006 Neil & Cameron - Emerging SEO Celebrities SEO Events Every so often in the SEO world, a new rockstar emerges onto the scene - engaging audiences at conferences, running a great blog and getting linked to on every other post in the feedreaders. This year, two of those guys are part of one company - Neil Patel & Cameron Olthuis of ACS. In all honesty, I've been blown away by their rapid rise to stardo... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 23, 2006 What I'm Thankful for this Thanksgiving SEO Events I'm just going to go crazy with this one because I have so much to be thankful for (note that a lot of this will be Pubcon-centric, due to the timing). Getting out of debt and turning SEOmoz into a profitable company - I owe almost all of it to the people who read this blog (and the rest directly to Danny Sullivan). Mystery Guest... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 19, 2006 One of the Most Talked About Incidents at Pubcon SEO Events As always, it's the dramatic moments that get the most press. At Las Vegas' Pubcon this year, one of the most talked-about moments was Matt Cutts' introduction at the podium during the Super Session at the end of (day 3) Thursday. I got a few emails through the suggestion box asking if I'd make a post on the topic (and heard plenty of buzz at the conference itself). Let's hope my memory se... Read this post",
