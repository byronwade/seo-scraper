SEO Black Hat is offering seats to this year's SEOktoberfest. Want to party in Munich and pick the brains of some of the best super affiliates and black hats around? If so, contact Black Hat and let him know you want in. It's a pricey ticket (5,000 Euros, or roughly a firstborn American child), but he's giving away one free seat if you blog about the event and send a trackback. Hmm, guess that means that this roundup mention is my raffle ticket. Hrm. I don't know how much affiliat/black hat stuff I can wrap my head around, but a trip to Munich sure sounds nice! ;) Read this post By: Jane Copland July 31, 2008 I Have A Question: The Best Of Q&A SEO Events There is a very large group of vocal, active members on SEOmoz whom we hardly ever see on the blog. Most of them rarely write YOUmoz posts and comment infrequently. However, they spend a lot of time in the same area of the site where I spend the majority of my time: SEO Q&A....

Crap. * Interesting opinions here: Paul Graham discusses pooled-risk company management, and 37signals disagrees with him, saying you don't need to sell your company in order to have financial freedom. Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley July 17, 2008 Roundup Thursday for the Week of 7/13/08 SEO Events Three star links: * 10e20 brings us \"The Ultimate Guide to Decoding Digg Speak.\" It's both amusing and surprisingly thorough. Pretty handy if you're an SMM noob and need to know what \"those crazy kids\" are talking about. * Now we know why your socks keep disappearing when you wash them...they make a good snake sweater! * Here's an interesting article about how the \"Google generation\" thinks differently. Generation Google appears to prefer multi-tasking, networking, multiple media sources,and images and video over text, while \"digital immigrants\" prefer the opposite. Interesting stuff.

And next week Google will announce ShowrStalkr, in which they spy on you while you're showering and inform you of any areas you've neglected to soap up. * Hey, check out how trendy SEOmoz is! Suck it, Cutts!

Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley June 13, 2008 Super-Sized Roundup Thursday(ish) for the Weeks of 6/1/08 and 6/8/08 SEO Events My apologies for the missing roundup last week--it was SMX Advanced, and we were pretty busy with conference happenings. I've combined news and whatnot from last week into this week's roundup, so please forgive the extra bloatedness of this week's post (there's no such thing as Alka-Seltzer for blogs, is there?). Stories, news, and other notable items from the past week: ... Read this post By: Danny Dover June 9, 2008 The Beginner's Checklist For Search Conferences SEO Events J. K. Rowling (She wrote a little book called Harry Potter) recently gave the commencement speech at Harvard University. She spoke about the power of failure and the incredible potential of imagination. It was a great speech that left me with one powerful lasting gem. She pointed out that humans are unique in their ability t... Read this post B By: Brent Payne June 9, 2008 Was SMX Advanced Too Black Hat or Just Not Enough Advanced White Hat? SEO Events Here is my two perspective on the heated debate regarding SMX Advanced 2008.There should be a session dedicated to blackhat seo tactics and I believe it's important to address in an advanced seo conference. However, it should be by choice to hear those tactics. I can't imagine being a consultant and convincing the in-house SEO manager of one of my clients to atte... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley June 6, 2008 SMX Advanced Recap (The R. Kelley Version) SEO Events It's hard having a conference in your own backyard. Everything feels so much more stressful--you have to drive back and forth from the conference to your place and back out for dinner and networking events, you have underlying priorities that are hard to miss (I missed the kickoff networking event at the Sculpture Park due to an open water swim clinic), you have spouses or family members you have ...
