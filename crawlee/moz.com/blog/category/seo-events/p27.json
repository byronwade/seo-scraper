  "content": "By: Rand Fishkin April 15, 2007 The Value of Attending Conferences SEO Events Last week, Jane, Scott, Rebecca and myself (plus Mystery Guest) spent the week in New York attending the Search Engine Strategies conference. This is my 13th SES show, and at this point, I've seen virtually all of the sessions and 90% of the speakers twice. However, like many others, I continue to participate beyond simply speaking - walking the show floors, attending sessions (though I missed ... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley April 15, 2007 My \"Don't Fire Me Rand\" Recap of SES New York SEO Events Now that I've had the weekend to recover from a week of too many drinks, too few sleep, too many new names and faces to remember, and just the right number of familiar faces to recognize, I thought I'd share with the mozdience what I was up to all week (partly because I love you and partly because Rand is making me, and I like my job and don't want to get fired). My partners in crime (Scott and Ja... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 10, 2007 Help Rand Craft Interview Questions for Google WMC Team SEO Events Tomorrow, Mike McDonald of WebProNews, Vanessa Fox of Google's Webmaster Central and I will attempt to create a second version of our first interview together. It's late, and I'm wiped (plus I still have some presentaiton polishing to do), so I'm hoping you'll help me to craft some questions to pose... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 28, 2007 Rand's Take on Recent Search News SEO Events Tons and tons of interesting news to report from the last couple weeks, and rather than just report, I'm going to go ahead and give my opinions, too. Search Engine Popularity Ratings - No one really knows what the search engine market share is, not Comscore, not Neilsen, not Hitwise. If they really managed data of th... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 26, 2007 SES Munich - Linkbait, Truffles & More Insomnia SEO Events On Friday evening, I hopped a flight from Seattle to Copenhagen, then Copenhagen to Munich, arriving Saturday around 5:00pm. Munich's a gorgeous city, and one of Germany's friendliest, a fact I've proven to myself by stopping most of the town's population to randomly ask for directions (impressive, since I've only been here 48 hours so far). From Mittlererings to Autobahns to a Mercedes wi... Read this post J By: Jeff Pollard March 21, 2007 What I learned at SXSWi - Kathy Sierra SEO Events Per some recent suggestions, I've decided to elaborate a little more about some of the specifics I learned in some of the SXSWi panels. Thus, I've decided to elaborate on the keynote given by Kathy Sierra of the Creating Passionate Users blog. She talked about our responsablity as developers to creating the best user experience. If you'd like to listen to Kathy's speech, SXSW has... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 15, 2007 How is it Already Thursday? Is Time Accelerating? (Actually, this is a Roundup Post) SEO Events As always, there's all sorts of good stuff in the search world this week: Best response to the Wall Street Journal's odd article on site moves goes to... Lisa Barone - who... Read this post J By: Judith Lewis March 11, 2007 Had to share - My first speaking engagment! SEO Events I'm really excited and had to share - I just spoke at my first professional conference and WOW!I spoke about practical things anyone can do to their website to help its organic rankings. I spoke about on page elements, keyword research, link building and link ninjas, linkbaiting and finished with some SEO tools.I was the most highly rated speaker with 5 out of 5 mode and... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 8, 2007 SEMpdx Searchfest 2007 SEO Events On Tuesday afternoon, Rebecca and I drove the 3 hours down to Portland, OR for our first SEMpdx Searchfest. We arrived at the hotel around 6pm and had drinks with many of the conference organizers. I also had a chance to meet and chat with Jeffrey Pruit from iCrossing, who gave the keynote the next morning. Rebecca and I dined with Matt McGee, Darcie, Scott Orth & Scott Fish at Oba!, a terr... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 7, 2007 Seven Short, Out-Of-Character Rants SEO Events This post is breaking format with tradition here at SEOmoz, but I think a good shaking up of the status quo is in order. I'm going to simply rant, in rough paragraph form, about 7 issues in the search world. I'm going to be generally more expressive, less forgiving and pull fewer punches (for which I fully expect to take some heat). WebMasterWorld and Cloaking... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 5, 2007 Rand Heads to Munich to Help Spread the Word on Linkbait (Vorhanden auf Deutsch) SEO Events On March 26th, I'll be speaking on the Linkbaiting, Social Search Marketing & Blogging panel in Munich, Germany. My intention is to bring examples of the ideas and strategies that have been so effective in the English-language market to German SEOs & website marketers. However, I could use a bit of help - my Ge... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 25, 2007 Public Media 2007 Conference Wrap-Up SEO Events The Public Media Conference in Boston proved to be one of the most unique audiences I've ever spoken to. Rather than webmasters and business owners, the crowd consisted primarily of reporters, station executives and public media contributors. These folks share the interests and goals of traffic, branding, influence and connection, despite the difference in focus (profit vs. relevance & fund... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley February 23, 2007 You Asked For It: SES London in Comic Strip Form SEO Events In order to please the masses, Rand once again chained me to my desk and ordered me to do a recap of SES London in an amusing comic book fashion. Thanks to Jeff and his spiffy MacBook (ComicLife yo!), this time I was able to create this batch of comics much easier than SES Chicago's Flash-tastrophe. Thanks, Jeff! Anyway,... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley February 22, 2007 SEMpdx SearchFest '07 in the Hizzy SEO Events In about a week and a half, Rand and I will be road-tripping to Portland to attend SEMpdx's day conference, SearchFest. Rand has reached a near-godlike status in the conference sphere, in that he was asked to speak at the conference and is allowed to pick a topic of his choosing. As a result, Rand will be performing his one-man show, \"Fishkin: Whitehat, Ho... Read this post",
