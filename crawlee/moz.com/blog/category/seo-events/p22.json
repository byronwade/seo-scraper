Rather than providing a live-blogging \"he said; she said\" commentary Rand has asked me to provide overviews & analytic commentary; I'll certainly do my best, but if I end up talking about what I had for my lunch you'll know that Rand got the wrong guy for the job. The day got off to...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 31, 2008 Vote for the SMX West Search Bowl Competitors SEO Events First off, a quick apology. I had posted this on Monday night without first checking with our nominees to ensure they could attend. I've now done so and thus, have a list of potential competitors who will be present if called upon! For those who may be confused, next month at the inaugural SMX West search marketing conference, two intrepid search marketers will take on teams from ...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 10, 2008 The Secret Value of Attending Conferences - and Why SMX West is a Must-Attend SEO Events I know how tough it can be to justify the expense of attending an industry conference. I also know how easy it can be :) In the world of search marketing, ROI is often based on traffic and conversions (or page views if advertising is the primary revenue model) and despite the fact that attending a conference won't always bring you tons of traffic and conversions (at least not directly), there's...
