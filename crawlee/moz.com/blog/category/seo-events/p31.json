  "content": "By: Rand Fishkin December 30, 2005 Bring Back Link Ninjas, Jim SEO Events A couple months ago, Jim Boykin and crew at WeBuildPages launched a training seminar called \"Link Ninjas\". In my opinion, not only was this a damn cool idea, it was well executed and a good way to get training in that most difficult of SEO ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 21, 2005 Updated Recommended List SEO Events I've re-created the old recommended SEO firms list here - Recommended SEO, Web Development & Support Firms. If you know that you should be on there, but aren't listed, drop me a line. Likewise if you find errors, omissions or want to be listed in a different category. I'm referring 4-6 people every day now, so hopefully you'll get so... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 14, 2005 Earl Grey's New Black Hat Paradise SEO Events My personal opinion is that you can't be an SEO \"expert\" without understanding the black hat side of the debate - the techniques that are working, those that don't, how money is made in that sector, and what the latest in hijacking, link spamming and automated content... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 6, 2005 SEO Gurus - A Decidely Dodgy Bunch SEO Events Jill Whalen's linking to a good post on her (new?) blog through her signature at HighRankings. I like what she's got to say: Often, when they get their answer, they write back with something like, “But, so-and-so SEO guru wrote this article here at [insert stupid SEO site that prints ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 1, 2005 Good Retrospective from Jim Boykin SEO Events Jim (of WeBuildPages) was interviewed by Aaron Pratt of SEO Buzzbox (a site I hadn't heard about until today). In it, he talks about the last few years of running an SEO company, getting called out for being \"evil\" by Matt Cutts and touches on how he's gotten \"whiter\" with the times. It's a ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 4, 2005 Kim Krause Interviewed by Andy Hagans SEO Events Kim's got some very wise words about everything from \"party pooper\" Jakob Nielsen to the obligation of SEO/Ms to give back to the web. It's a solid read: ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 2, 2005 A Day in the Life SEO Events I really liked this post from Kim Krause Berg regarding her schedule, her views on working at home or choosing an office and her thoughtful dialogue on a Threadwatch thread about men working at home (as opposed to women who do it). I've been meaning to p... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 29, 2005 What should Aaron Do? SEO Events Aaron Wall is struggling with the forces of the publishing world, who've re-nigged on their original agreement to let him maintain e-book publishing rights if they take his book to press. Aaron has a lot of positives and ne... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 25, 2005 Dan Thies has A Lot to Offer SEO Events I contracted out a keyword research report from Dan Thies yesterday afternoon (hard to believe they're only $99) and spoke a little on the phone. Dan has a lot of cool stuff coming up, including a limited engagement... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 10, 2005 Aaron's Interview with Matt Cutts SEO Events This is a totally worthwhile read (if a little long). Mr. Wall (of SEOBook) gives Matt some floaters, some tough questions and some in the middle and Matt answers them all with honesty and... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 6, 2005 Katrina &amp; the SEO World SEO Events Hurricane Katrina has taken a devastating toll on the gulf states of the US and the people who lived there. The SEO world has responded with a variety of donations and contributions, as well as threads, posts and information relating to the subject. DazzlinDo... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 6, 2005 War in Uganda SEO Events Aaron Wall has an important blog today on the subject of war in Uganda. Don't think to yourself \"hey, it's not my problem,\" just head over to the post, read it, and form your own opinions. There's a chance for the online world to make a big difference, so let's get to it. In other news, I'm leaving for San Jose tomorrow morning ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 29, 2005 A Little Humor on a Friday SEO Events For entertainment purposes, it's really not necessary to leave the SEO forums. Case in Point - a post last night that has kept up all morning at SEOChat. There's some good back and forth on white vs. gray vs. black, and some admissions of all types from people of all types. Plus, there's a theory ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 1, 2005 Ian Turner's Been Found SEO Events Ian has been found - the details are at Threadwatch. He's in the Atlanta airport, delayed due to a lack of a passport and an especially prickly TSA. I haven't felt this relieved in a long time.... Read this post",
