  "content": "By: Rand Fishkin March 7, 2006 Is Craigslist Blowing their Opportunity? Moz News I talked to some very smart folks last night over dinner about Craigslist and their position in the market. Currently, CL is the leader in online classifieds, they've had great success porting their model to other cities and countries and they have a built-in loyalty and fan base that rivals that of any online user-generated-content site. The question is - w... Read this post O By: Oatmeal March 1, 2006 New features on SEOmoz Moz News As promised, here's a quick run-down of the new features on SEOmoz. Search - This will search the entire site. It needs some fine tuning, but it's effective for the time being. Threaded blog comments - You can now reply to individual comments rather than just the blog entry itself. Th... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 14, 2006 Happy Valentine's Day Moz News I thought this site summed up the Internet's general feeling towards Valentine's Day. I'm not particularly against the day - it's always nice to go out to a fancy restaurant in a nice suit. I just wish it weren't so crowded or hard to get reservations... ...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 11, 2006 Your Recommended Lists Moz News I've been referencing a lot of folks to our recommended list lately, but we're finding that many come back without a satisfactory target, particularly when they're seeking local folks. I thought I'd ask the readers if they have recommended lists of their own with SEOs, web developers, designers, marketers, hosts, etc. that could be used to help expand whe... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 6, 2006 Blog Infected by The LinkBait Monster Moz News Alan Bellows' Damn Interesting is practically an entire collection of pure linkbait articles - the kind that not only make for good reading, but have to be linked to, emailed, and searched for at friend's houses in order to show them what they're missing. Just a quick dissection of how he does it so well: It's not just him - there's a... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 5, 2006 The Marvelous Tale of Blowverbodsbord Moz News In order to move past the very sad day we've just had here in Seattle, I've got an entirely new, off-the-wall subject. Via Plankie's post at HighRankings, I came across some nifty... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 1, 2006 WebMonkey on Bittorrent Clients Moz News Since I know that most of the readers here are big fans of free content, I figured this review of Bittorrent clients by Michael Calore might be of interest. His final take for Windows users is µTorrent and for Mac, the official Bittor... Read this post E By: EGOL January 28, 2006 StumbleUpon.com Moz News Anybody getting good traffic from StumbleUpon.com? That site first started getting my attention a few months ago while examining my logs. I didn't think that it would be a serious source of traffic but the referrals have gone up and now I am avera... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 27, 2006 Remember the \"Back to Work\" Button? Moz News Back in the days before the web, many of the MS Windows bundles games had \"back to work\" buttons that would open up a blank spreadsheet document on top of the game in order to \"hide\" a worker's activities from perusing bosses doing their walk around. Hilarious... Read this post O By: Oatmeal January 19, 2006 Re-designing SEOmoz Moz News The re-design of SEOmoz has proven itself to be a very difficult and time consuming task, as you can see I'm still working on the header. Rand suggested I write a blog entry so you can all see how things are coming along and share in my turmoil. :) Some of the designs turned out okay, others are just plain horrible. I've found my best work comes by accident, so I often just ...

I know. I know. Michael's not your typical personality ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 17, 2006 What a Phone Call to SEOmoz Looks Like Moz News With so many phone calls coming in nowadays, I thought it might be interesting to diagram the anatomy of what a request for services call to SEOmoz looks like. Because the number on the website routes directly to my cellphone when I'm not in the office, I get calls at 5:30am and 10:00pm, even on the weekends. Naturally, I turn the phone to silent when I'm sleeping, but I've had calls wi... Read this post O By: Oatmeal January 16, 2006 AJAX Powered IP to Location Lookup Moz News In the midst of re-designing SEOmoz I decided I really needed a change of pace. I've only lightly used AJAX, so I decided to build an AJAX powered tool that looks up the geographic location of an IP address. It seemed simple enough to build and I figured it'd ...
