  "content": "By: Rand Fishkin October 25, 2006 Help Give SEOmoz a Tagline Moz News Currently, SEOmoz has the dismally boring and horribly generic tagline, \"a search engine optimization resource.\" With all the tagline and article headline writing we do for clients, you'd think we could do better, but sadly, we're suffering from the same disease as the cobbler's children.

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 4, 2006 Switching to Partial Text RSS Feed - Vote Your Opinion Moz News For a long time, SEOmoz's RSS feed has been full text - the entire content of every post (minus images, polls & embedded video) has gone out to readers that subscribe through a feed format. According to Feedburner, a majority of our blog readership accesses the blog in this manner - we average a bit over 4,000 feed subscribers, get about 5-600 clickthroughs from feed listings and have only ...

Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley September 11, 2006 Entry #1: Generating Our Stuff on Their Space Moz News User generated content seems to be a pendulum-swing against the 1980s and ‘90s-style elitism that had all aspects of the media, including the web, tucked away in the firm grasp of a small, skilled group.
