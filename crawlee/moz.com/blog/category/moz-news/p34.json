  "content": "O By: Oatmeal September 18, 2007 My Departure from SEOmoz Moz News As Rand mentioned in his recent post: Big Changes at SEOmoz, I'm leaving the company to pursue other opportunities. It's been nearly 4 and a half years, which is a millennium in tech-industry time, and I feel that SEOmoz is at a point where I'm comfortable leaving. Previously, I was the only developer, designer, and systems administrator and our entire infrastructure depended on me. With Jeff, and more recently Mel, I can now leave knowing that SEOmoz is in good hands. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 18, 2007 Big Changes Afoot at SEOmoz Moz News This is a tough post to write. Not because I'm not excited and not because the news I want to share isn't positive, but simply because I feel like I've been keeping something from you for the past few weeks, and I hate doing that. Of course, it's nowhere near as tough as hiding my Super Bowl engagement from Mystery Guest...

Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley September 12, 2007 Just When You Think Search Misconceptions Can't Get Any Worse... Moz News A while back I talked about the frustrations of explaining my line of work to my relatives, but I'm starting to think that maybe ignorance truly is bliss. I recently heard two examples of non-search people's perceptions about how the search engines work, and it is frustrating to think that some people believe that this is actually how the search industry operates.

Moz News Since Read/Write Web is covering 10 future web trends today, I though it would be a perfect time to present my own theories on how search engines might be innovating their technologies. Query Intent Detection It seems that all of the major engines have eschewed disambiguati... Read this post L By: lauramaccallow@yahoo.co.uk September 4, 2007 Big Brands - Big Issues - Small Summary Moz News Yes, I’m back on my Big Brand soapbox… again. We have great clients, most really eager to get effective SEO going, but facing big issues. A lot of the issues faced by the big brands can be applied to smaller sites in a more scalable manner, so I thought I would post about some of the major issues the big brands face: Onpage factors really only acc... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 1, 2007 Labor Day Fun - Vote on Facial Hair for Rand Moz News It's Labor Day in the US, and technically, that means we should be celebrating the history of the labor movement and the advancements that lead to greater leisure time. This weekend, Mystery Guest and I are joining my grandparents to hike some canyons in the SouthWest - Zion, Antelope and hopefully, Bryce, too. Since the weather is hovering around 108 degrees fahrenheit, 42 centigrade, I d... Read this post By: Peter Newsome August 30, 2007 5 ways to annoy SEOmozzers Moz News Even though I've only been a member for a couple of months, I'm a big fan of SEOmoz - I love the blog posts (both from staff and users), the articles, the tools and all the premium content, but I think the best thing about SEOmoz is the great community of Mozzers.The comments and feedback provided by the members here can turn a good article into a great one thanks to the varying ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 23, 2007 If You Were SEOmoz... Would You Take Outside Investment? Moz News I'm taking a temporary break in conference coverage (don't worry - there will be more next week) to poll some of the smartest people I know (that's you, SEOmoz readers), about an issue that's been keeping Gillian and I up plenty of nights during the past 3 months. SEOmoz is at a tipping point of sorts - we've gone from being primarily a search marketing consultantcy business, ... Read this post M By: Mark Barrera August 22, 2007 Inside Look at the SEOmoz Landing Pages Moz News I was stumbling around the net today and ran across one of the SEOmoz PPC ads. I remembered reading a post by Rand recently talking about a Premium Member Landing Page Contest and wanted to see if it was going on so I clicked the ad to see the landing page. After doing so, I looked around to see if I could find these...

Enjoy! Rand: Gillian:... Read this post K By: Karen Browning-Cutler August 1, 2007 You Can't Cover Your Tracks Moz News I know that the keyword meta tag is dead, just like punk rock is dead and Andy Kaufman is dead. Is there a huge, pressing reason to use it? No, of course not. A little research reveals that few engines, if any, even look at it anymore. Every little bit helps, right? What drives me nuts, however, is the common concensus among the few professionals I've met and spoken with on forums that seem... Read this post",
