  "content": "O By: Oatmeal August 2, 2006 Printer Friendly SEOmoz & Comments Moz News Just a quick update folks - I've created a media=\"print\" CSS file that creates printer friendly versions of all SEOmoz's pages. You should now be able to print out the stuff on our site without any major graphical issues. Printed pages won't look perfect (there's a lot of spacing issues), but it's still a huge improvement. I removed the header, footer, logo, and secondary navigation. I a... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 2, 2006 Expert Writing - A Contrast of the Good & the Ugly Moz News I read two articles yesterday via Del.icio.us and couldn't help but be struck by the contrast between them, and the application of that reading experience to the practice of writing. Although better writing isn't the focus of this blog, it certainly does help with everything from link building to public relations to branding, and thus is worthy of some attention. The first article comes... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley July 19, 2006 Ten Ways to Take a Break from Tedious SEO Work Moz News I thought I'd hop on the \"Top 10\" bandwagon and give you my very own Top 10 list. Having researched some keywords for one of our clients for the past three days, I find myself constantly feeling the urge to take mental breaks for fear of being driven insane by monotonous data entry; thus, I present my Ten Ways to Take a Break from Tedious SEO Work: Peer over yo... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 18, 2006 All the Things I Should Have Linked To Moz News Once again, I've fallen behind the times in blogging and haven't given proper respect to more than a few sites, pages and people who deserve it. Thus, this token attempt at absolution from the angry gods of the blogosphere: Todd Malicoat went line by line through that \"revealed\" Google ranking code and c... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 6, 2006 A Trip to Montreal Moz News Sure, the post is a bit off-topic, but I figure if Mike Grehan can write about falling in love with cities, why not SEOmoz? This was my first trip to Montreal, and my first experience with Quebec. Luckily, I didn't have to rely on my non-existant French as much as I'd feared, as the city is completely bilingual - though reading the English in the... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 29, 2006 Keyword Difficulty Tool Upgrade Moz News Matt's been hard at work this week, upgrading SEOmoz's KW Difficulty Tool. It's now faster, more accurate and comes with spiffier graphics. In honor, I thought it would be valuable to write a post on how to read this data: ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 24, 2006 Why Meeting People Face to Face Matters Moz News So far this year, I've spent 40 days and nights away from home. It's not that I love travel - in truth, it wears on me and I'm happiest when I'm home. Despite living here my whole life, I'm completely enamored with Seattle and the life that I have here. So why spend more than 1/5 of the year to date away? Why log the hundreds of hours in the air, waiting in airports, driving rental cars and sle... Read this post M By: mozUser1469147917838 June 5, 2006 A glimpse inside the head of 2K Moz News Because of being extremely busy at the moment, I'm going to make this post short and sweet. Below are some links that allow to see what I consider the best /most important reads during the past week: ClickZ has an interesting article about AJAX and web analytics. This is an ... Read this post E By: EGOL June 2, 2006 For Statistics Hounds Moz News I really enjoy statistics and have run into some nice summaries today.If you are curious about what monitor resolution people are using, which browser, which operating system, etc. here is a link that gives some trends over time.... Browser StatisticsI was surprised to see that Mac operating system was NOT going e... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 30, 2006 The Great Curse of Insomnia Moz News It's 7:45pm in Seattle and 3:45am here in London. Why am I up? The same reason I was up last night at this time, and, for that matter, the night before that. My body can't seem to adjust to Greenwich Mean Time. Of course, I've been far too busy to sleep during the day, which leaves me wondering how long a 26-year old male can actually go without any significant quantity of shut-eye. Luc... Read this post E By: EGOL May 23, 2006 Don't Count on Search Traffic in Your Ten Year Plan Moz News I see powerful things in Digg, Slashdot, Stumbleupon, Delicious, Wikipedia, forums of all types, and other sites that attract people because of a common interest or activity. These sites are \"communities\" of visitors or authors. These sites drive massive traffic in a short blast or massive traffic that is cumulative over time.My guess is that these highly popular ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 23, 2006 Too Much Good Stuff to Miss - Roundup Post Moz News Too many items from early this week and last last week are critical reading. Make sure you take notice of these, as a few have a strong effect on the industry: Wired exposes NSA wiretapping on the Internet Backbone at AT&T and they wrote an excellent piece on ... Read this post O By: Oatmeal May 15, 2006 Run SEOmoz Run Moz News This past weekend a bunch of us SEOmozzers participated in a 5k (3 mile) benefit run around greenlake. I'd just like to publicly say GOOD JOB to everyone that put the effort in and ran the distance. Although not highly competitive, it was for a good cause and I think we all queued up some rad karma points. Also, kudos to Kat for initiating the idea. Here's a few photos:... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 13, 2006 Negative Feedback for the SEOmoz Blog Moz News For the first time since launch, I've been receiving some negative feedback on certain blog entries, not just from newcomers to the site, but from long-time readers and respected search industry folks. Since the primary purpose of this blog is to provide a hub of information, sharing, news and, on occassion, humor for the SEO community, I thought it wise to ask for an entire thread devoted...
