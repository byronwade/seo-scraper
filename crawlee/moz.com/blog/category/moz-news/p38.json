Since I announced back in September to several friends that I'd be posting SEOmoz's financial records on the blog, people have generally responded with shock and amazement. While public companies are forced by law to issue their balance sheets & earning statements, for private companies, financial informatio...

We'll see a few copies of Digg, a few MySpace-like clones, a couple del.icio.us' and plenty of maps mash-ups ... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley December 15, 2006 5 Things You Didn't Know About Rebecca and Rand Moz News Rand and I have been tagged by several SEOs to participate in Square Angle's game of blog tag.

I figured it was worth spending 20 minutes or so to save myself hours and hours over the next 12 months. My steps included: Adding/Removing/Organizing my folders into how I use the web Weeding out all the sites and links I never visit anymore (there were more than 3 dozen) Going throug... Read this post O By: Oatmeal December 8, 2006 How to Capitalize SEOmoz Moz News Hopefully I'm not contributing to the noise on SEOmoz by writing this post, but I think a quick entry on the subject is warranted. Very few people capitalize SEOmoz properly - and by capitalize I mean in terms of grammar (not money). We're the ones to blame, our name isn't exactly something anyone would know how to capitalize c... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 8, 2006 Signal to Noise Ratio at SEOmoz - Please Add your Votes & Comments Moz News I've had several folks mention that they believe the ratio of high-quality posts at SEOmoz has declined over the last several months. I'd like to get a determination from the community as to your opinions about the amount of content and the relative levels of value provided. As we roll out a new version in the next few weeks, we have some options about how to structure the content to allow you ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 7, 2006 More on Nofollow at SEOmoz and How Bad Outbounds Can Impact Websites Moz News Although Matt filled in for me yesterday to author a quick piece, I thought I'd expand on this topic before flying home to Seattle, as it's raised the ire of several folks hoping for a more thorough explanation. It's also an excellent time to talk about how bad outbound links can affect your website. At SEOmoz, we've got 10K+ members with profiles, and a visible amount of those wer... Read this post O By: Oatmeal December 6, 2006 We're adding nofollow to links on SEOmoz profile pages Moz News I'm posting on behalf of Rand who is currently busy at SES Chicago. Prior to today if you wanted a link from SEOmoz all you had to do was sign up for an account, edit the URL field in your profile, and add a blog comment. We left this in place simply because we didn't care if the strength of our outbound links was diluted. Although SEO was high on our list of consider... Read this post E By: EGOL December 4, 2006 What is \"SiteAdvisor\" Saying About Your Sites? Moz News One of the folks in my office was searching Google and noticed a tiny icon beside every website in the SERPs - even on the AdWords. At first we thought we thought that Google was testing something new but a mouseover of the button yielded a McAfee SiteAdvisor bubble as shown below. (We were not searching for \"Porn\"... Honest!... I pos... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley November 20, 2006 British Vocabulary 101 Moz News Well, I'm back from England. After a weekend filled with television, giant cheeseburgers, and free refills, I returned to work today. Rand, Jeff, and Jane gave me the scoop on PubCon antics, Matt called me a nerd for wearing my glasses (I'm still trying to adjust back to Seattle time, and contacts = burning), and Scott kept reminding me to not call security because he isn't trespassing and actuall...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 5, 2006 What does the moz in SEOmoz mean? Moz News I think I get asked this question on average 4X per week, more during conferences and after we've been in the press and less when I hide in the cupboard and make Brandon answer the phones. It's certainly a valid one, though and deserving of a definitive answer. Here's what the \"moz\" in SEOmoz means: We're building off the history of organizations like DMOZ, ... Read this post",
