But do you know what they really want out of you? Do you know how they really feel? Do you know what they want more of or less of in your industry? Do you know what they like or don’t like on your site or your competitor’s sites? Do you know what they think about your new product launch? If you knew this information, how could you use it to improve your products or services?

Read this post K By: Keenan Steel January 26, 2011 The Power Of Volunteer Search Marketing Branding This post is primarily a beginning guide to doing volunteer search engine marketing for nonprofit organizations based on my experience, but it is also an effort to convince more companies to donate time and resources to charities. Companies that do so may find significant SEO and PR benefits for their own site, as explained in what follows. Over the last several years, I've had a ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 25, 2011 Recommendations for Blog Commenting as a Marketing Strategy Branding Many of us in the web marketing space have a love/hate relationship with the practice of leveraging blog comments as a marketing strategy. On the one hand, it can bring valuable participation and content to our sites and provide an outlet for us to reach other communities and bloggers/comment-enabled communities. But, it's also an endless source of spam and low quality contributions that teeter...

Read this post T By: Tom Mcloughlin March 23, 2010 Notes From a Newbie: From PR to SEO Branding My personal foray into the SEO world is still in its early days after I joined an SEO company last September. I had previously worked in the digital department of a PR agency working on social media campaigns after joining on their graduate scheme. I made the move to SEO in the hope of finding an area which provided more concrete, tangible results rather than the often flimsy output of the ... Read this post By: pvalbocino February 1, 2010 How Can PR, SEO and CEO People Work Together for Link Building? Branding Back in 2002, when I was graduating as a Journalist in Brazil, I had never heard of the acronym SEO, let alone ever being taught about how to apply Journalism in Search Engine Optimization. I don’t know if in Europe it was different, but in 2002 we were just burying the last typewriters in my country. I just wonder if the new generation of journalists leaving university are less... Read this post M By: Mike Kalil June 29, 2009 Tips from a recovering journalist: How to write effective press releases that help SEO Branding It's been said here before: Press releases are much less powerful than they used to be for SEO purposes. While churning out news releases and submitting them to free sites may not do much, the medium can actually be more powerful than ever if used right. Convincing a single reporter or high-profile blogger to pick up your news is infinitely more beneficial... Read this post W By: WesUpchurch March 27, 2009 Crafting Effective Press Releases for Search Engine Marketing Branding The days when press releases were written for the sole purpose of pitching a story to a news editor are over. The consumer may also read the press release at places such as Google News, Digg, and Technorati. There are many more places to submit your press release today and more people are reading. Read this post W By: WesUpchurch March 24, 2009 When It Comes to Reputation Management, Use Protection! Branding There have been a few mentions on SEOmoz regarding online reputation management and public relations. Rand discussed how to remove a page from Google and RZ Awhyles brought up the simple fact that sometimes, you just need to apologize directly. But neither talked about ways to discourage negative feedback being distributed online in the first place. Taking measures to prevent reputation damage and negative PR is always better than trying to recover from a less than positive review or statement. Read this post A By: Alex Whyles March 9, 2009 It Ain't All Good: Not All PR is Good for Business Branding One of the few benefits of being ‘between jobs’ is that it gives you time to look around and become a voyeur of sorts. Whilst spending quite a bit of time looking at what the current job market is after and where it’s heading, as well as trying to get back in, I came across the following search results for one particular company: Read this post D By: developdaly October 30, 2008 Reputation Management Theory Branding Search Engine Reputation Management (SERM) may just be a nicely packaged sales term to re-brand SEO as something more palatable for those not willing to spend money on the \"vague\" idea of SEO. Nonetheless, it has a specific goal to improve the reputation of someone or something in the search results, often achieved by a process of utilizing many domains to push down the negative results.
