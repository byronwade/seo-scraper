  "content": "By: Rand Fishkin December 17, 2011 Aaron Wall and I Debate the Open Discussion of Webspam Blogging In years past, I'd occassionally post about various aspects of webspam - manipulative links, cloaking, thin content, etc. In these posts, I'd use examples I'd seen - sometimes particularly egregious ones, other times more subtle offenders - both to help illustrate the points and to provide concrete evidence. It's hard to say \"link spam is a big problem and Google's su... Read this post By: Sajeet Haridas Nair December 7, 2011 Protect Your Website From Becoming a Doorway Page - Google Patent Style Blogging I have a confession to make. I hate patents as I simply do not understand them and probably never will. Maybe it’s the lingo or maybe it’s the plain formatting or maybe it’s the unbelievably complicated language and words that are used to describe the simplest of statements or even worse, it is written in a language which is not English and I have not yet realized it.

After doing some research online, I found another fantastic example of how to continue to beat Google...

Read this post By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers May 18, 2011 Marketing Ethics: Persuasion vs. Manipulation Blogging I step back from the black-hat/white-hat debate to look at the broader picture of marketing ethics. Bonus: 5 crudely drawn illustrations. Read this post By: Gabriel Goldenberg April 12, 2011 Want to Analyze the Data from an SEO Hacking Attack? Blogging The Hacking Attack My blog got hacked and injected with a folder containing 645 pages, all full of auto-generated content, loaded onto plagiarized templates and linking to about 1700 different websites - making it difficult to discern which are the spammers' own and which are legit. I asked about crawling these pages in the Pro Q&am... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 10, 2011 White Hat SEO: It F@$#ing Works Blogging I hate webspam. I hate what it's done to the reputation of hardworking, honest, smart web marketers who help websites earn search traffic. I hate how it's poisoned the acronym SEO; a title I'm proud to wear. I hate that it makes legitimate marketing tactics less fruitful. And I hate, perhaps most of all, when it works. Here's a search for \"buy propecia,\" which is a drug I actua... Read this post By: Fábio Ricotta March 4, 2011 Decolar.com, the Major Brazilian Travel Site was Banned from Google Blogging Recently, the largest Latin America travel website, Decolar.com (also known as Despegar) has just been from Google results due to Webmaster Guidelines violation, resulting in a big buzz in the Brazilian SEO community. The first tweet about the case was from Flavio Raimundo, pointing to the site:decolar.com Google Results page: Read this post R By: Rouven Balci January 28, 2011 How Organized Spam is Taking Control of Google's Search Results Blogging In the past few months, I have been watching a very unsettling trend unfold in very competitive ecommerce search results on Google. It appears that huge amounts of money are put into place to systematically and successfully manipulate highly competitive search terms in order to sell fake merchandise of almost every bigger brand out there. Some of these sites even... Read this post By: Joel Rush December 9, 2010 Spam Tactics and How They Rank Blogging I am getting constantly frustrated with bad SEO not necessarily pure black hat, but bad linking and bad habits. It also seems like it’s not just me. I would not be getting frustrated if it did not get you results but it does, lets prove that and see which search engines are... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 1, 2010 A Recommendation for Google's Webspam Team Blogging First off, let me just say that there are a lot of people smarter and more experienced in scalably attacking web spam than I am working in the Search Quality division at Google and specifically on the Spam team. However, as a search enthusiast, a Google fan and an SEO, it seems to me that, all due respect, they're getting played - hard.Word is, the Spam team's key personnel had some time... Read this post D By: DragonSearch November 17, 2010 Beyond Good and Evil in SEO Blogging I recently heard a story about a local SEO shop whose customers, overnight, almost ALL lost ranking in Google. Apparently, the shop had been engaging in “black hat” techniques. I’m pretty sure the teller of the tale made a “tsk tsk” sound at the end to help emphasize this as another instance where people who do evil get their just desserts. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 28, 2010 The Danger of Overdoing SEO Blogging During my first few years in the SEO field, half of the sites I'd visit - those my SEO brethren in the forums or over email owned - were what today we'd call \"over-optimized.\" They tended to have features like:Keyword after keyword stuffed into the title element of every pageOverly-lengthy and keyword rich URL stringsPage filled with \"SEO'd\" con... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 17, 2010 I'm Getting More Worried about the Effectiveness of Webspam Blogging For a long time, if you asked me about spamming the search engines, whether with hardcore black hat tactics or merely gray hat link acquisition, I'd say that in the long run, neither was the right move. Building a great site and a great brand through hard work, white hat links, solid content and marketing strategies has always been my path of choice. It still is today, but my faith is definitel...
