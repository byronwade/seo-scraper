Modules like Mod_Rewrite have definitely made our lives a whole lot easier. But there are many more, less known modules, that can serve the life of a (Black Hat) SEO. Mod_Proxy is one of those modules, originally created to serve as a proxy/caching module but also known fo...

The practice involves proactively generating spammy comments, posts, links, etc. from a competitor's domain in order to make bloggers, social media contributors, forum owners, etc. ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 26, 2007 What it Looks Like to Be Hit By Google's Real Estate Reciprocal Link Penalty Blogging There can be little doubt that JohnSabia.com, a Fort Lauderdale real estate agent's site, was engaging in some very manipulative linking practices in the past. However, John's a reformed gray hat turned white and knows quite a bit more about the world of SEO than he did prior to Google's ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 11, 2007 How to Handle a Google Penalty - And, an Example from the Field of Real Estate Blogging Last week, I interviewed the head of Google's spam team, Matt Cutts, about a lot of different issues. One of the most intriguing to webmasters appears to have been the discussion in the 2nd video (around 6:00) where we go into a chat about the real estate industry online, where thousands of websites have recently lost rankings due to participation in egregious manipulation through reciprocal li... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 18, 2007 Why I Love the Sordid Underbelly of the Search World Blogging Beware SEOmoz readers. This is not your typical blog entry from Rand. It contains not only foul language, but a glorification of those parts of the search and online world that I shy away from. It's not for the delicate of heart, but I figure my writing style could use a bit of a shakeup, and what the heck, it's midnight Friday in Beijing, what better time to author something scandalous? ...

Tim Converse used to do it. Matt Cutts has done it plenty of ... Read this post G By: GeoffreyF67 April 11, 2007 Spammers Never Die, They Just Become Consultants! Blogging For the past 3 years I've followed the spamming/black hat community rather closely.During that period of time, it has been very interesting to watch the various tools that have come out to help people spam as well as the types of people who have used them.The majority of folks have basically fallen into two categories:Guru Black Hat - These are the folks who promot... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 4, 2007 Parasite Hosting Now Dominating Spam Results Blogging I was shocked today to see how incredibly effective parasite hosting has become. If you're not familiar with the concept, parasite hosting refers to a spammer's creation of a keyword targeted page on a strong, legitimate domain. The idea here is that if they can control that page's content, they can rank for searches and re-direct the traffic to whatever site/page they choose. For example, I ju...

Reading SEO blogs and articles is nice and all, but when you practice SEO, that's when you really learn how Google works.

Apparently, there were tens of thousands of searches for Google sucks d... Read this post G By: GeoffreyF67 March 2, 2007 Using a Public E-Mail Address? Perhaps You Should Rethink That Strategy Blogging Are you using an e-mail address for your business that people can easily get? Is it listed off your web page? Perhaps you've gone a step further and used a bit of javascript to obsfucate it so that bots can't crawl and find that link? Think that's enough? Well, think again...

Blogging Last week in London, I sat in on the organic listings forum, where myself, Dave Naylor, Greg Boser, Mikkel DeMib & Barry Lloyd fielded a slough of great questions. One exchange in particular stands out to me - the lone white hat on the panel (though I've certainly been accused of being at least a bit gray hat for my public views on link buying). It featured a question from the audience rega...

Blogging Bill brings up some interesting points in the comment on this thread about the search engines blocking the pages that give the rank and/or links out from the XSS exploitable pages.
