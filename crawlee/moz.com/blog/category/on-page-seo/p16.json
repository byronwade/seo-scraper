Meyers June 10, 2008 7 Ways to Tame Duplicate Content On-page SEO Whether or not you believe that Google has an official duplicate content penalty, there's no question that duplicate content hurts. Letting your indexed pages run wild means losing control of your content, and that leaves search engines guessing about your site and its purpose. Imagine that you have 25,000 pages in the Go... Read this post By: Paul Lalley May 19, 2008 Shooting Yourself In the Foot: The Top 10 Dumbest Site Design Practices On-page SEO Despite some of the posts on SEOmoz, site optimization is NOT a science. Science requires accurate, contestable data. No metrics or analytics deliver empirical data so it ain’t no science. SEO pros don’t even agree on which weighting factors have the most impact on PR and TR. However, it doesn’t take rock solid numbers to identify dumb design decisions &nda... Read this post S By: SEOArticlesandTip April 2, 2008 Page Layout and SEO On-page SEO I have seen the long discussions on various blogs and forums about SEO and various factors affecting the SEO. But did not find the much on the effect of site layout on SEO. I think that this is the major factor among the onsite optimization factors.The site must be very easy to use and read by the spiders as well as by the visitors. I mean just visiting the main page of your site, user m... Read this post F By: franzenzenhofer March 31, 2008 SEO for HTTPS On-page SEO Ok. You work on a big company site and everything is within the secure protocol? Here is what you have to mind for your onsite optimization: An https site can rank as well as an http site. If done right.Keep all your certificates valid, all time, 24/7/365.Https sites are more work for the servers, so there is the possibility of a slower download -> Keep your sit...

They allow you to more or less setup some applications without having to be a programmer. Kind of compelling to some folks, right?The question given to me was what impact would it have on SEO if a company were to utilize Caspio. I was give... Read this post E By: Eric Bryant March 17, 2008 Do Other Meta Tags Really Work? On-page SEO Though I by no means consider myself an SEO \"expert\" (is there such a thing?) I try always to take a pragmatist-positivist approach to SEO techniques. That is, I research a technique; try it out on a personal site; observe the results; record the data; repeat the experiment; then publish the findings.Unfortunately for our industry, many SEO \"specialists\" have... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 16, 2008 Results of Google Experimentation - Only the First Anchor Text Counts On-page SEO Before I was inundated with the responsibilities of running a company and managing a few hundred emails a day, I used to spend a lot of time testing theories about how the search engines handled certain elements on a site or page. I'd test the engines to find answers to questions like: Does a keyword perform better or worse if it's higher up in the code of a page? (yep)...

On-page SEO If you thought I was going to give out some magical secret as to how you can achieve this result, sorry, I’m merely pointing out that it can (and has) been done! Earlier this week I was analysing local web design firms in Adelaide, Australia and noticed something interesting about the website that came up in first place for the phrase “website design Adelaide”. After look... Read this post By: David Mihm November 13, 2007 What Laziness Taught Me About the Importance of Flat Architecture On-page SEO N.B. This post is intended for relatively new SEOs with smaller sites. Intermediate and advanced SEOs probably already know most of this information, and I do not claim to have experience with sites numbering thousands of pages, for which different strategies are surely more effective. Some of you may know that I run an NCAA bas... Read this post S By: Sonia Boukelif October 8, 2007 Is Link Juice in Limited Supply? On-page SEO I read the interview with Matt Cutts today and it talks about the different uses of noindex, nofollow, and robots.txt. He states (1) whether they stop the passing of “link juice” (PageRank) (2) whether or not the page it still crawled and (3) whether or not it keeps the page out of Google&... Read this post K By: Karen Browning-Cutler October 5, 2007 Local Search Improved When Geared State-wide? On-page SEO I have an interesting SEO point/question. Of all the sites I continually re-optimize to see what works, I have had the most interesting success with the company's site itself. I was trying to rank well for our \"small town's name Web Design\" or \"our small town's name graphic design,\" etc. But then I decided to see how well we could rank for Florida web design and Fl... Read this post S By: Sonia Boukelif October 3, 2007 Link Title Attribute and its SEO Benefit On-page SEO A subject not talked about much in the SEO world is, Link Title Attributes and if they have any benefit in SEO. To understand this topic and to see if it was worth me putting any effort into doing, I did some research and came up with my own conclusions. I welcome all other SEO specialists to share their thoughts on this topic and help me and others get a better understanding of this. ... Read this post P By: Phil Wright September 19, 2007 H1s and H2s - the right tool for the job. On-page SEO I'm pretty new to looking at SEO, having previously left it up to chance and the hope that search engine's would reward me for producing valid code. But I have found myself getting sucked deeper and deeper into it as time goes on.Why? Because I love the idea that good web content is holistic. Good writing, that is relevant and well structured delivered with a brevity of code that makes the...
