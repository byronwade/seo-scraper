  "content": "By: Adam Henige April 8, 2009 An Idiot's Attempt to Explain Term Vector Theory, Term Weight, and a Slight Argument for Keyword Density On-page SEO Among the SEO creme de la creme, keyword density is a phrase not even worth re-hashing, but for many, it remains a mainstay in their SEO lexicon. I'd be lying if I said I haven't run my own experiments and seen my own successes in the past with upping my keyword density, despite seemingly \"knowing better.\" I've always had some knowledge of term vector theory, and had an understanding at only the highest of levels, but never actually sat down and tried to walk my math-retired mind through it to truly get it. Read this post F By: FilipeSantos March 15, 2009 Taking a Deep-Dive Approach to Competitive Analysis for SEO On-page SEO Say you've got a competitor or perhaps competitors that are starting to trump you on the first page where you've been vehemently optimizing your website(s) and building valuable links, and without a seemingly good reason. What is an SEO to do but to start digging? Well, a good SEO digs the basics and an excellent SEO goes much further to understand the demographic, suspected patterns and technical advantages the competitor(s) has/have. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 19, 2009 Headsmacking Tip #11 - Refresh Legacy Content for a Rankings Boost On-page SEO This week's headsmacking tip is extremely powerful and pretty darn simple to implement. The premise is straightforward - you've got old content that ranks in the top 20-30 results, but never achieves first page (or top 5) rankings. Frequently, we see a lot of sites making the mistake of trying to link build (both internally and externally) to the old content: ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 7, 2009 Testing the Value of Anchor Text Optimized Internal Links On-page SEO We've recently gotten to do (and see results of) some testing around internal links & anchor text and have come to some interesting, if not 100% proven, conclusions. As a disclaimer, SEO testing, whether done in a controlled environment or on live sites, is both challenging to quantify and subject to fair critiques both practically and academically. That said, I feel fairly confident in stating the following findings. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 25, 2008 A Christmas Present for SEOs: 10 Tips to Pick the Low Hanging Fruit On-page SEO It's very late on Christmas Eve, and I can hear our hosts, my cousin-in-law, and his girlfriend snoring in the next room. Their new dog is curled up on the couch, grumbling and huffing through his wet nose, one eye barely open. Mystery Guest crashed out an hour ago after we finished watching the new Muppets Christmas Special (I love Statler and Waldorf). Here in Ocean Beach, CA, the streets are quiet, the rain's stopped and it's just the sounds of surf and the occasional drunken reveler wandering home from the bars on Newport Ave, filled with Christmas cheer.

Google is the dominant player in mobile search in the US (source: Nielsen Mobile) - our test site hasn't yet been indexed in the other search engines so I'll have to report back later on how it does there: Read this post D By: dharmayu October 13, 2008 Search Engine Optimization is All About the Way a Naive Visitor Thinks... On-page SEO This post is mainly emphasized on the simplified process of search engine optimization. In past and at some extend in current trend we hear about maintaining the Keyword density on any webpage. Previously some of the expert gave more importance to the keyword density factor on onpage optimization. But the fact is little bit different.You can take any keyword and then search it in ... Read this post M By: MikePiper September 22, 2008 Joomla Users: Stop Wasting Your Link Juice On-page SEO As we've all learned, controlling the flow of link juice within your site is an excellent way to help promote your higher-quality pages within Google's rankings.One of the best ways to do this is to add nofollow tags to links in your navigation that are for pages you really don't want to waste link juice on. (Privacy Policy, About page, Contact Us, etc)Unfortunately, u...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 4, 2008 Headsmacking Tip #4: Use Keyword Variations with Matching Intent Together On-page SEO For this week's tip, I thought we'd quickly run through an issue that, early in my SEO career, frequently confused me (and seems to trip up lots of sites today, too). The concept is simple - given a page that's ranking well for Keyword \"A\" some folks make the mistake of targeting close variations of \"A\" on separate pages without good justification. Here's a quick exa... Read this post D By: Duncan Morris July 27, 2008 Information Architecture - A Site Review is Nothing Without It On-page SEO Will and I have a recurring argument about what should and shouldn't be in a site review. My argument has been, and remains that before you can do a proper site review you need to do keyword research, in order to validate that the site architecture is correct. I have been doing a fair few site reviews recently and one thing has stuck out. Yes, almost every site I've ever loo...

When it comes to top-level menu navigation, most of us are thinking about which b...

On-page SEO This one keeps popping up, so I'm taking a short blog post to address it as quickly and efficiently as possible (mostly because I have an SEOmoz board meeting tomorrow, so I need my zzzs). Many SEOs ask themselves how many individual word and phrases are ideal to target together on a single URL. The tough part is - there's no hard and fast answer. The number can be as low as 1 and ... Read this post P By: Phil Berryman June 12, 2008 Title and Description Optimisation - How to Look Good and Keep It Tidy On-page SEO Greetings again from London. In this post I am going to cover the fairly simple process I go through when optimising my titles and meta descriptions for important pages with one dominant term.
