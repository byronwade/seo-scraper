Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 18, 2007 Link Farming in the Toronto Star User Experience (UX) I feel almost bad for reporters in the mainstream media who attempt to cover the search marketing field. It's a tough gig to wrap your head around the concepts of what makes the industry tick, made doubly so by shady tactics and those who practice them.

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 25, 2006 Two Great Pieces from Slate; One on the Long Tail, the Other - Linkbait User Experience (UX) Slate's begging for two blog entries with their content today, but I'm going to put both subject in one to help conserve space.
