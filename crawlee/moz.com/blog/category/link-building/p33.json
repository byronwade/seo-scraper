Whether it's in an editorial article, a guest post, etc, it's great for sending some strength and trust to your site. However, the drawback of links from big sites, is that you might find it's on a small page. The newly published page will take some time to get indexed, much of it's strength (certainly initially) is likely to come from internal links, and it's unlikely to have a great crawl rate. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 18, 2009 Revisiting Themed Links Link Building Many years ago, when I first started in the search marketing industry, several instances of the debate around \"themed links\" flared up, cooled off and reared their head again. Nowadays, it makes infrequent, though periodic appearances in the thinking, recommendations and forums of the SEO world, and I thought it would be wise to revist the issue, lay out the discussion points and get ... Read this post By: Rob Ousbey June 8, 2009 8 Tips to Get Domain Diversity (with the anchor text you want) Link Building As diligent Search Marketers know, it's quite a good idea to get links from strong/trusted sites pointing to yours and combine this with building a single link or two from a large number of smaller websites. Read this post By: jamie hands June 5, 2009 Unique Content for Text Links Link Building Background I’m pretty sure that many of us on here are aware of the recent Go Compare case where Go Compare dropped in the SERP’s for their brand name for a few days. There was talk at the time that they were penalised for violating Google’s Terms and Conditions (TOC’s).

I’m happy about this not just because I’m a fan of his, which I admit I am, but because it means I’ll still get some more traffic from his hilarious turn on the show. The things he says and his sort of delusional ideas and stories start to grow on you, along with his kid-like passion and earnestness. He just wants to be part of the team.

Not because these articles provide shocking new insights - most of the aforementioned mentioned lists mention pretty much the same tactics - but because they remind people of how work intensive the ongoing process of link building can be, and because they make people think due to their in-depth nature. \"How can I use these tactics for our website?\" \"Which of the listed tactics are relevant for our company?\" Or, even better, \"What strategies would I have added to this list?\" Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 30, 2009 Catalysts for Earning Natural Links & Link Conversion Rates Link Building \"Reference worthy content\" is a phrase you'll hear a lot in the SEO realm. The intent behind the statement is simple - build content that people will be likely to cite when they create works on the web. Parsing the motivations that inspire those citations, however, is anything but obvious. Tonight, I thought I'd try to list features that make content \"reference worthy&q...

Become an Editor Link Building Getting your website listed in the DMOZ directory in anything less than geologic time frames is next to impossible. Most SEOs submit their sites and then forget about ever getting listed. However, there is a way to guarantee that your site will be included in the DMOZ directory quickly: become a DMOZ editor for the category in which you have applied to have your website listed.

Rand already touched on this, but I thought I'd try and take it another step by looking at what if Google did count these types of links. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 15, 2009 The Best in the Link Building Business: Most Linked-To Domains & Pages on the Web Link Building I've talked in the past about how much value we've found from studying the most linked-to content on the web, and tonight, we've updated that list again, showing relative rises and falls in link popularity across the web's most popular sites & pages. ... Read this post E By: elbrian April 15, 2009 Abstract Link Building Ideas: Desktop Customization Sites Link Building It seems every web developer's biggest concern, excluding keyword density/research, is finding new and innovative ways to create quality inbound links back to your website. While there is no easy-button to begin generating inbound links, there are certainly many abstract approaches and techniques a developer can utilize to make inbound link generation a bit less tedious. Read this post By: Ken Lyons April 10, 2009 The Small Business Link Building Guide: Get Your Own House in Order First Link Building I do a lot of consulting work for small business owners, particularly in link building. One of the first things I do when I start link building for a new client is find out if they have a link exchange page.

Today I logged in to retrieve a lost password and saw that I had over 600 new emails. All of them are spam, newsletters, shopping deals, etc--I rarely get \"legit\" emails sent to that account since the vast majority of my contacts know to reach me at my Gmail or SEOmoz email address. So it was with great amusement that I saw an email from 1/29/09 titled \"Link Exchange Request\" from some dude named Scott (not our Scott, don't worry). I've shared the email below: Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 25, 2009 An Impressive Case Study in Link Acquisition: OpenCube.com Link Building Short post tonight, as demands on my time are in excess of even their normally overwhelming quantities.
