There's no easy answer, but there is a simple way I can show you the kinds of content and let you think up your own way to do it. Thanks to our friends at de...

This happens to me all the time - sometimes because they're an educational institution, a non-profit or simply a webmaster who doesn't want to \"compromise\".
