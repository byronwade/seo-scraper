It’s simpler. Whenever your “content” is republished somewhere … many times you’ll notice that the web... Read this post By: KoMarketing Associates February 12, 2007 Wikipedia, SEOMoz and Bad Link Building Practices Link Building When the news came out that Wikipedia would be adding \"nofollow\" attributes to all of the links to external posts, it really was not a surprising move, in my opinion. Because of the website's high visibility in search, traffic volumes and ability to easily develop, create and \"link\" content, i...

Link Building Ok masterbaiters, it is time for you take your thumbs from where they usually are -- the keyboard typing some clever missive to garner links -- to give this post a thumbs down. You won't like it. The Google bomb for President Bush has finally withered to a miserable failure. Its cleverness had a built-in time bomb waiting to boom, and perhaps linkbaiting has a bomb t...

This post is designed to show that although some types of article marketing have been devalued it still works very well if you are creative. There are a number of different ways to tackle this issue, not all... Read this post E By: Ella_D February 3, 2007 Guillaume's Round-Up of SEOmoz's Best SEO Training Posts - Part 1 Link Building I just spent the last 5 hours going through 30-35% of the entire SEOmoz posts because we're training new interns here, and I wanted them to get a good idea of the whole concept of SEO, some known people, and I basically went through the last 600 articles published by SEOmoz, as well as a few other sources. This is like the wrap up of the most insightfuls only SEO related posts in the ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 25, 2007 Paid Links That Are Truly Undetectable Link Building Mr. Cutts recently wrote a story about so-called \"undetectable spam,\" in which he countered any paid link building service's claim that it could be truly undetectable to search engine spam sniffers like himself. I'd agree with most of what Matt says - almost any large-scale link development operation that's designed to boo...

She wrote about her experience, which she described as largely negative: In addition to the negative comments and free for all party over at Digg, ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 21, 2007 Wikipedia Finally Makes the Right Decision Link Building It may seem odd coming from someone who practices link building and whose clients require the service, but I'm gald to see that Wikipedia has shifted back to nofollow on all outbound links. What surprises me is that a relatively small-time SEO contest was the catalyst (according to ...

Link Building This week I've been link building for a new client, a key part of which involves development around specific company names and specific company products.And it got me thinking as to whether link development could be next in line for trademark infringement suits.In this instance, I don't think there's any danger as these are products/services openly resold via third-parties.... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 19, 2006 I Disagree with Danny & the Google Engineers About Link Buying Practices Link Building SEOmoz is, in my opinion, as \"white-hat\" in our optimization practices as an SEO firm can get with being illogical. Yet, we still advise some of our smaller and mid-size clients to buy links - we even go as far as to buy links for our own in-house projects. This practice would seem to directly conflict with every piece of advice given by prominent search engineers and, most recently, ...

As many may have noticed, DMOZ hasn't been accepting any new submissions for several months - when you try to submit a site, they simply show this page (link condom applied; they'll get no quality vote...
