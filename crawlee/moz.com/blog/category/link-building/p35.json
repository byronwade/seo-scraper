I was going to write a 2009 predictions post but then I realised that I have no idea what's going to happen this year. Facebook will go offline? Brazil will go on sale for 13p and Twitter will buy them? God knows. Anyway, instead of doing that I decided to write a post with something useful in it. Read this post J By: JasonG.Williscroft January 6, 2009 Link Farming for Fun and Profit Link Building As a black-hat SEO tool, link farming has been around since approximately the morning after Brin & Page submitted their seminal thesis. It was a bad idea to begin with—demonstrating a poor appreciation of the math behind the PageRank algorithm—and it's become an even worse idea since Google et al started actively pursuing and penalizing link farmers.

One of the folks was more than a little frustrated at how his PR (for now this means public relations, not page rank) team was hindering rather than helping his SEO efforts. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 16, 2008 Headsmacking Tip #10 - Incentivize Links Link Building A very short tip, but one that has been proving incredibly valuable to all of our clients of late. When you think about attracting links organically, the process goes something like this: 1. What content can I create that will naturally attract links? 2. What format should I put it in for maximum share-ability? 3. How can I promote it to reach the largest possible relevant audience? Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 17, 2008 8 Ways to Buy Links Without \"Buying Links\" Link Building This post is sourced from my presentation at Pubcon on the Linkfluence: How to Buy Links with Maximum Juice and Minimum Risk panel. Since it received such positive feedback and a lot of requests for sharing, I thought I'd do so in a more reference-able way here on the blog. If you'd like to download the slide deck, you can find it ... Read this post By: Gabriel Goldenberg November 16, 2008 Wanna Crowd-Source a Link Building Reporting Tool? Link Building I recently shared a link building report template that simplifies our lives as SEOs. If you've looked at it closely though, you'd probably realize that a lot of the information doesn't take human eyes to see nor human hands to record. The romantic undead could do it quite easily. Read this post By: Marc Bitanga November 5, 2008 How to Generate Backlinks from Search Traffic from Brand Keywords Link Building Recently a site I was working on experienced a huge spike in search traffic from branded keywords. The site was fairly new and no major link building had taken place, and we hadn't worked on approaching any bloggers or media outlets for editorial links. Yet when reviewing our web analytics, we noticed that the spike in traffic were from keywords related to our company name. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 29, 2008 Headsmacking Tip #9 - Vertical Content Can Earn You Links Link Building For the next in my headsmacking series, I thought we'd look at the ever-challenging task of earning links to your site. Though it may seem daunting, sprinkling some creativity on the link acquisition puzzle can definitely make the process easier (and sometimes, more fun, too). One of the strategies that seems to elude many site owners and marketers is that of leveraging their vertical content t...

Point 2 of Rands 6 ‘takeaways’ referred to affiliate programs and the PR value passed by do-follow affiliate links.... Read this post D By: DreamWebDesigns October 23, 2008 CSS Galleries: Great for Traffic and PageRank Link Building About CSS Galleries There are hundreds of CSS galleries on the internet in various languages. Their goal is to showcase visually appealing websites for design inspiration. Websites usually must be XHTML and CSS valid to be accepted. Most galleries prefer the site not have Flash. Although PageRank is constantly changing, many currently have a PageRank of 4 or higher, which can do a great deal to help your site. Read this post By: John McElborough October 17, 2008 Nofollow Put My Kids Through College! Link Building For ages I was on the boat with SEOs who moan about the stupidity of nofollow. But recently I've moved away from this school of thought. Now I definitely haven't moved to the side of the fence that sides with Google in saying that nofollow either a) cuts down on comment spam, or b) improves the quality of search results.

I'm just trying to \"keep it real\". It 'aint nothing but link love baby I was looking at the stats of one of my blogs and in the \"came from\" section of the report I saw a referral from another blog. I was cur... Read this post R By: Rebecca Haden October 7, 2008 The Great Google SketchUp Experiment Link Building SEO is an analytical occupation, so it’s no surprise that we experiment. The trouble is, we can’t experiment freely with our clients’ websites, and setting up a website just for experimentation doesn’t really mimic the natural conditions in the online environment. Therefore, I was delighted when I recently had the opportunity to arrange a small experiment under remarkably controlled conditions.

I have been looking at setting up an RSS feed on our site. I am wrestling with having a feed that publishes new product pages as they appear or one that maybe feeds information on product maintenance and care, or maybe one on product related trivia (coming from our blog with a different url), o...
