Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 16, 2008 The Quizzical Duality of Paid Links Link Building Google's been pretty clear - buy or sell links, particularly those that come from broker-type services, and we'll take steps to penalize your site.

It makes for a pretty simple relationship. You offer the publisher of another site money for a link, and in return you get to specify the link. If they don't want to give you the anchor text you want, you move onto another site.<... Read this post By: Jane Copland May 26, 2008 People Who Can't Link, and a Vague Argument for Google Analytics Link Building We work in an industry where no one lacks the ability to link.
