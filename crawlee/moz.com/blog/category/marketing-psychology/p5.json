I’ve read the books, scrolled through the blogs, created test sites, monkey’d around on many different tools and created my own Excel Super Spreadsheet for analytics and data analysis. My desktop has learned to hate my fix... Read this post By: Casey Henry July 17, 2009 CAPTCHAs' Effect on Conversion Rates Marketing Psychology Personally I hate SPAM with a passion and I’m sure many of you will agree that you hate it also. Some time ago, I had a client ask me if there was a way for us to eliminate the SPAM that was generated from his web form.

I was at home and so didn't have any of the following to hand: * iphone * pen * regular phone * internet Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley October 28, 2008 Are You Forcing Your Users to Superfluously Click? Marketing Psychology Unnecessary clicks really put the \"super\" in \"superfluous,\" yet we run into them all the time. Whether they're the fancy yet impractical creation by a site designer, a lazy workaround courtesy of an apathetic developer, or a misguided \"I've been trying to architect this site for two months now and I can no longer see straight\" decision by an SEO, these seemingly innocent clicks can have a negative impact on conversion rates or, simply put, they can irritate users. Below are a few examples of some clicks that cause me to grit my teeth and shake my fist.

Marketing Psychology This short post looks at a Jakob Nielsen alertbox column entitled, How Little Do Users Read? Why a short post? Well, it would appear that we don't read long posts, so why bother?

Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley January 22, 2008 Your Users Aren't Intuitive, Which is Why Your Forms Need to Be Marketing Psychology For SEM Tuesday I'm cheating a little and talking about forms and usability; however, if you have a sign up form or some sort of registration on your landing pages, this is sound advice that ties in well. In an attempt to be hardcore in 2008, I decided, at Christine's insistence, to sign up for the New Balance Half I... Read this post By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers May 30, 2007 Soft Cloaking: META Tags, Robots.txt & Sitemaps Marketing Psychology It's no mystery that people in the SEO world have strong feelings about cloaking. The very mention of an off-white hat tactic in one of my YouMOZ posts earned me multiple thumbs down and accusations of cloaking. One comment in particular interested me, though: someone suggested that they consider cloaking to be virtually any tactic that treats search engines differently from end-users. As... Read this post P By: Patrick Sexton May 8, 2007 How to put Google custom site search into your current website design Marketing Psychology A few years ago a webmaster did not have many choices available to have a search solution for their websites. That has changed dramatically, but up to last year or so ago the free site searches provided by Yahoo and Google were less than ideal. They interrupted your visitors experience by taking them to a search results page that looked entirely different than the page they were on. ...

Read this post N By: NathaniaJohnson March 8, 2007 A Trip Down Memory Lane Marketing Psychology A couple weeks ago, I was watching an episode of Monk where the obsessive-compulsive detective was introduced to the wonderful world of computers and the internet. I LOL-ed as he won a Solitaire game for the first time and watched the cards go dancing across the screen. For many of us, that's terribly old school. But it was endearing because it brings back good memories. I was lucky ... Read this post By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers March 2, 2007 How SEO & Usability Finally Became Friends Marketing Psychology Flash back with me to 1999. You’re a hapless web designer, and you’ve just spent a long day convincing your boss that just because hot pink is his favorite color doesn’t mean it’s the best bet for your financial services website.
