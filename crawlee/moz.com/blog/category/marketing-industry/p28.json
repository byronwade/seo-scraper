Read this post V By: Vinny Goldsmith November 21, 2007 4 Things That Are Wrong With the 4 Hour Workweek Marketing Industry I was anxious to read The 4-Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss. I had picked it up while waiting in line at my local Kinkos because something on the dust jacket caught my attention. I thought it would be kind of a \"Getting Things Done\" for the Internet Marketing set and once I got the book home, I couldn't wait to read it. Anticipation, unfortunate...

We go away with five other families once a year; we’ve been doing so for the past five. We had a superb time. Waking up to the sound of the chickens cocking and the sunlight shining. It really was an exceptional trip.One evening I was thinking about our trip, a book that I had read many times before came to mine. It made me think - the trip ...

It's déjà vu all o...

The SEOmoz blog is great, they'll say, but a book has the power to connect with an enormous audience, and besides, they'll continue, I need something to read on the plane. I've finally come to the realization that they're right. Despite my frenetic schedule, packed with travel, clients, in-house projects, e...

Is there important information, key to the success of your business, that you have not communicated to the people who would inherit it or keep it running until you are able to return? If there is important information of this type then you need a contingency plan. Without a plan some of your most impo...
