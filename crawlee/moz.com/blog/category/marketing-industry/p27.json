  "content": "By: Rand Fishkin December 30, 2008 10 Irrational Human Behaviors and How to Leverage Them to Improve Web Marketing Marketing Industry I couldn't help but love Chris Yeh's Outline of Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions. It's a fascinating look into the surprisingly predictable psychology that powers human actions and reactions, and I think there are some definitive lessons we can take away from the piece and apply to web marketing. Let's run through the list: Read this post By: Danny Dover December 10, 2008 The Five Secret Ways Nintendo Rules The Internet Marketing Industry By keeping children and teenagers entertained back in the 1980s, Nintendo has claimed a spot in the heart of the present day internet generation. Nintendo's internet success is widely accepted yet largely undocumented. The tactics below reveal only the tip of the iceberg. ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 1, 2008 Why Companies Are Investing in SEO During the Economic Downturn Marketing Industry There's no two ways about it - SEO is hot again. In the last 6 weeks, SEOmoz has received a considerably higher than normal volume of requests for consulting. Alongside that, we've been getting calls from venture capital firms out of the blue - 7 to date - asking either about investments they're considering in the SEO sphere (and requesting insight) or literally asking whether SEOmoz would like... Read this post By: Danny Dover October 15, 2008 The Internet Marketer's Handbook Marketing Industry This month marks the end of my first year at SEOmoz. I have spent literally hundreds of hours learning and trying to perfect my SEO and marketing skills. Although, I still have a ways to go to catch up with my expert co-workers, I have made a lot of progress. I credit this to the people I have relied on and the many tools that have helped me along the way. The following is a c...

A couple of years ago Rebecca covered the SEOmoz hiring process, with a full re-cap of how Jane became a 'mozzer. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 18, 2008 What Does the Stock Market Implosion Mean for Your Online Business? Marketing Industry The news this week is pretty dire. On the heels of the US Government's bailout of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and AIG Financial, stock markets in the US, Russia, Japan and elsewhere are suffering tremendous losses. The NYTimes paints a linkbait-worthy, interactive picture of the financial industries collapse. If you're anything like me, this news brings on some anxiety and fear - neither of which a... Read this post By: Jane Copland September 3, 2008 New Guide Release: The Professional's Guide to PageRank Optimization Marketing Industry As promised last week and earlier today via our Twitter account, we have a new PRO guide to release today. Written by Darren Slatten, The Professional's Guide to PageRank Optimization is a fantastic resource on both the theory and mathematics behind PageRank, and on how SEOs can efficiently practice PageRank sculpting. ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 2, 2008 Why Reputable SEO Firms Don't Promise Guaranteed Search Engine Rankings Marketing Industry Tonight, I received an email with a familiar question, asking why the top companies providing SEO consulting and development services rarely ever provide guarantees (and virtually never use it as a marketing tactic). To this, there are three solid reasons that compel SEOmoz internally as well as the many companies we work with/... Read this post By: Will Critchlow August 8, 2008 How to Grow Your SEO Firm Marketing Industry Another business-focussed post from me today (with a little SEO at the end). I was answering a Q&A the other day in a kind of tag-team formation with Rand when I realised that some of my thinking would make a good blog post. The question was about how to grow a new agency and asked whether we thought that contacting site owners and pointing out flaws / suggesting improvements was a good way to win new business. Rand and I sung with one voice to say (paraphrased) that we weren't big fans of the cold approach and that networking (both online and offline) was one of the keys to success. I wanted to elaborate on that a little bit. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 6, 2008 The Most Valuable Lesson I Learned When Pursuing a Finance Major Marketing Industry Not many people know that I actually attended the University of Washington in Seattle and worked, briefly, towards a degree in finance, thinking that I might join the ranks of Wall Street. It was a long time ago (in web years), and I dropped out of the program two classes away from graduation to pursue the company that would become SEOmoz full time (in 2001). Before I did, though, I met a ... Read this post By: Will Critchlow July 15, 2008 Where's the Structure to the Domain Market? Domain Name Funds, Mortgages and Leases Marketing Industry Owning a domain name is much like owning land. On top of that land you can build something valuable (or something you want to use yourself), you can sell the land on to someone else (with or without construction) and it has an address. Of course, this applies more to generic domains.

Billy Costigan: Yeah, sure, he was the president before Lincoln. Frank Costello: Lennon said, \"I'm an artist. You give me a fucking tuba, I'll get you something out of it.\" Billy Costigan: [sarcastically] Well I tell you Mr. Costello, I'd like to squeeze some fucking money out of it. ... Read this post By: Danny Dover May 22, 2008 Know Your Playing Field: The Real Top 100 Domains Marketing Industry You would think that if someone didn’t know what they were searching for, they would stop looking. Yet everyday, I talk to people who aimlessly spend their time and energy looking for some far away holy grail. As a SEO my quest for success is a little better defined. I want to work on websites that drive immense traffic, be at the top of competitive SERPs and most of all, I wa... Read this post By: Danny Dover May 13, 2008 The Beginner's Guide to Becoming an SEO Marketing Industry About two weeks ago Rand and Scott posted a Whiteboard Friday explaining how to get a SEO job. I think it is a great resource for SEO’s who already have a lot of experience, but what about those who don’t?
