Content Marketing We bloggers talk a lot about finding our voice, that mystical quality that is uniquely us and yet somehow resonates with a wider audience. What happens, though, when your blog gets written by a group of authors? How does a company or community blog find its voice and not just devolve into a schizophrenic mess? Read this post L By: LucyLangdon July 20, 2009 Getting an SEO Copywriting Job Content Marketing The inspiration for this post came when I was chatting with a recently graduated friend of mine who'd been looking for work online. Much like myself when I graduated with that all-purpose English Lit degree, she was looking for copywriting jobs online. Before I started at Distilled I did a bit of freelance writing so I knew exactly where she was coming from. Out of curiosity, I decided to have a poke around craigslist and gumtree- a couple of regular haunts of mine about 18 months ago. The very first thing I noticed was that the vast majority all of the writing jobs mentioned SEO, if not in their title then somewhere in their description. I don't remember it being like that all. Read this post G By: George Davis June 10, 2009 An Analysis of Great YOUmoz Post Aesthetics Content Marketing For a long time now I have wondered what sets apart great search marketing articles (namely, YOUmoz posts) from not so great ones. Unfortunately, there is no short answer to this question. Extensive discourse both online and off makes search marketing a tough subject to get a definite answer on. Fortunately, the YOUmoz thumbs/comment system provides a great place for us to start, and by limiting ourselves to tangible factors, we can draw safe conclusions from its data. I will follow up with another post examining this information from a content-based viewpoint, but for today our discussion points will be strictly visual.

Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley May 21, 2009 Lessons Learned from 3 Years of Blogging Content Marketing The beginning of this month (May 2nd, to be exact) marked my 3 year anniversary as a blogger. My first post on SEOmoz was a paragraph long and consisted of asking our readers if they know of any Spanish-language SEO blogs. It attracted 18 comments. Huzzah! Since then, I've published 241 more posts, with this one being #243. I thought I'd reflect back on my three years of blogging and share the good, the bad, the downright ugly, and the lessons I've learned along the way. Read this post C By: Chris Lister May 19, 2009 The Seven Deadly Sins of Company Blogging Content Marketing We all know that blogs, when used properly, can be excellent tools for promoting your organization and expanding your client base while providing insight into the interworking of your company.

Read this post G By: Gabriel Dicristofaro May 12, 2009 Lost in the Ocean of Ghost Writers Content Marketing Hello, my name is Gabriel, like the angel, but not quite the same. I've been studying SEO trends for over 10 years now. I started learning back when I was a Quality Engineering Intern for EarthLink, Inc. Which basically means I stuck the 'ISP Service\" marketing CD into a Mac and PC and checked the database integration for typos. Translation. I was bored out of my adventurous mind.
