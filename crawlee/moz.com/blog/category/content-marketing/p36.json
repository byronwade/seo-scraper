This week, an interesting email came in to one of our blog si... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 5, 2011 SEO 101 for Travel Bloggers Content Marketing Several weekends ago, for the first time, I accompanied my wife, Geraldine (aka Everywhereist, whose blog was just placed on Time.com's Top 25 Blogs of 2011 and then on Forbes' Top 10 Lifestyle Sites; woo hoo!), to Vancouver, BC for a professional conference focused on her career rather than mine (TBEX - the Travel Bloggers Exchange).

From the early days of usenet (and before that, on prehistoric technologies that came before my time) people have been asking experts for answers. You can't fail to have noticed, however, that it has resulted in some of the lowest quality content on the web. For far too many questions, the ranking answer is Yahoo! Answers (or similar) that looks as though it was written by someone who found writing YouTube comments too intellectually challenging.

But the trouble with creativity and tizzed-up text is it can distract from the main point of SEO; the business and your profit.

Too often however I see people focused on producing individual pieces of content aiming to get links and attention. Putting together a content strategy requires much more than a single piece of content - it requires a vision and strategy for how you're going to publish your content, why type of content you will be publishing, how your audience wil...

So the question becomes, how do you acquire better content? Buy It One of the reasons that content farms were started in the first place is because quality writing is expensive. Good writing re...
