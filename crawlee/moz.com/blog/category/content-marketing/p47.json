Many have taken to creating great content in the hopes that the members of these sites will appreciate it, but others have turned to manipulative practices in the hopes o...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 12, 2006 Why I Keep Politics Out of A Professional Blog Content Marketing One of the earliest lessons I learned in the forums, blogs & communities of the professional, search marketing sphere was to keep my politics private. It's a sad reality that logical debate and discussion of something critical to our lives must remain sequestered, but the current political environment in the US and in many places abroad prevents rational presentation of fact and opinion on ... Read this post O By: Oatmeal August 17, 2006 Results from our Latest Linkbait Adventure Content Marketing While attending an SES session last week I decided to put together some linkbait. The session itself wasn't particularly interesting and inspiration had struck so I figured I'd make better use of my time and write some kind of guide or howto article. The result was the 5 HTML elements you probably never use blog entry. My original plan ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 15, 2006 Ranking 50 Top Blogs in the Search Space Content Marketing The search & search marketing fields have, over the last 4 years, become overrun with bloggers. It would seem that many of us have been drinking our own Kool-Aid and hopping on the blog bandwagon. Lately, more and more folks have been asking for my take on this trend - what do I read? How often do I visit? Who do I respect? In a controversial move, rather than simply creating a blog...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 20, 2006 Top 100 Digg Users Control 56% of Digg's HomePage Content Content Marketing When folks think of Digg, they're often misled into believing that the content seen on the homepage is representative of what a wide base of Internet users think is news-worthy and important. The numbers tell a different story - that of all stories that make it to the front page of Digg, more than 20% come from a select group of 20 users. Digg isn't shy about hiding this fact, their top users p... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 14, 2006 Compelling Blogs I've Stumbled On Lately Content Marketing In case you're seeking some inspiration for writing on your own blog or in need of strong examples to point your executive team/marketing director/non-believer business partner to, I thought I'd share a few favorite blogs (outside the webdev/SEO sphere). I've just gone ahead and listed the titles, along with an excerpt: WaiterRant.net...

It talks about French digg-like websites. Our blog has hit the first page of major French 2.0 digg-like websites for approximately 28hours now . I think most of our French readers would like to know which s...

But what is it all about? The upcoming articles will be trying to identify how the emergence of videoblogging (aka vlogging) can benefit video amateurs and professionals, as well as SEO marketers, journalists and compani... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 4, 2006 There Must be a Better Metric for Blog Influence Measurement Content Marketing As I noted early this week, there's a lot to be desired from blog ranking and measurement tools. Technorati's measure of influence via links is the most common method used, followed closely by Alexa data (which can be badly skewed, particularly when the URL is inside a much larger host). At SEOmoz, we used several key indicators... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 1, 2006 Tracking Influence in the Blogosphere Content Marketing Let's say I wanted to compare the relative levels of inluence of two bloggers in the same field. Although no method other than direct access to their visitor stats is going to be entirely accurate, there are several pieces of data that can provide a clue as to how \"far and wide\" a blogger's readership extends: Alexa data - though i...
