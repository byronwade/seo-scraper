The checklist below varies from very simple actions through to big decisions and longer term strategies.

The article didn't quite make it on some of the major social news sites, but it d... Read this post By: Paul Lalley April 7, 2009 William Shakespeare: Worst Web Writer EVER! Content Marketing Bill Shakespeare – you know, The Bard – would have made a terrible web writer. He never gave a thought to keyword density and didn’t even know what strong text was or how to use it in web writing. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 7, 2009 21 Tips to Earn Links and Tweets to Your Blog Post Content Marketing It's been a long time since I've covered blogging strategies, and my recent panel with one of the world's foremost authorities got me thinking that given our success, both with the SEOmoz blog and with blogs for clients, it's time to share a bit more. Today, I'd like to cover how to make that single post you're composing more likely to earn the attention it deserves. Let's dive into the list: Read this post S By: Sarah Carling March 30, 2009 Why I'll Keep Posting to YOUmoz Content Marketing I have seen a few comments around and about lately stating that there is no point starting a blog unless you have something to new/interesting to contribute, and that the SEO blog \"market\" is saturated with blogs, making it pointless for new SEO bloggers to start. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 18, 2009 Headsmacking Tip #12: Don't Abdicate Control of Your Content Content Marketing I've been away from my \"headsmacking\" series (see the first 11 here) a bit too long, and despite an early morning flight to Reykjavik tomorrow for the RIMC, this subject is certainly deserving of attention. Besides, Mystery Guest always says I can sleep... Read this post T By: TimStaines March 11, 2009 Review of the Thumb Up/Down Judicial System w/ Suggestions Content Marketing It's pretty easy to thumb someone's comments up or down here at SEOmoz. You just register and away you go. Notice: Reading a post or its comments is NOT a requirement for contributing your opinion via thumb. This is not a situation that is unique to SEOmoz, nor is it something that they can do much about. There’s just no way to enforce the “reading before thumbing rule,” at least not now, but don’t be surprised if some offshoot of iris scanning makes this possible in the future.

Let me share some tips to increase your blog visibility. If there are any mistakes or suggestions, please comment. Read this post By: Paul Lalley March 2, 2009 Content Spam 2.0: What This Means to SEO Content Marketing Weird email requests lately. One guy wanted a bid on 1,000 articles – all about apartments. I doubt there are 1,000 things you could even say about apartments, much less write 1,000 articles on the subject. And if tasked with such an assignment, any self-respecting copywriter would gouge out her eyes with a spork after a day or two. Tops. Read this post S By: SeanMaguire February 12, 2009 An Interview With The World's Greatest SEO, SEOmofo.com, Darren Slatten, Who Is Available For Hire Content Marketing Good day, fellow mozzers. This past month during my annual vacation to Afghanistan, while traversing the Karakorum Mountains I caught up with the Most Famous SEO In The World, Mr. Darren Slatten. Fortunately for me, Darren had recently wandered from his cave to stock up on rice and opium after a long cold winter. After much prying, Darren reluctantly agreed to this far reaching interview. So, grab some popcorn, sit back and revel in the greatness that is Darren Slatten - The World's Greatest SEO on the planet Earth. Read this post By: Stuart P Turner February 9, 2009 The Pros and Cons of Writing Your Own Blog Content Marketing After Rebecca’s desperate plea for YOUmoz posts, I felt compelled to stop being a lazy churl and get my finger out. So here you go! Self promotion is a big thing in our little community, and in my comment I alluded that it may be leading to the dwindling number of YOUmoz posts. As such, for all you lovely SEO people I am going to lay down my pros and cons of posting on your own blog, as opposed to posting here.

Tonight, I'd like to repeat that process and throw up some dilemmas that, once again, have me in a quandry. Does QDD Give an Inherent Boost to Negative Subject Matter? Some rumors have be... Read this post F By: Fred McCoy II January 29, 2009 Everyone Forgets Sometimes: Interlinking Keywords in Blog Posts Content Marketing I had to smack myself on the head the other day when one of my fellow bloggers (one who knows nothing about SEO) expressed his frustration about a specific problem. Recently the Creative Fluff design blog had received a large number of hits for one specific post, but none of that traffic really went anywhere else on the site, and my friend was wondering, “Well, how do we get them to go elsewhere if they’re reading one article?” I had no immediate answer, but he quickly finished up his statement with, “Why aren’t words related to other parts of the website linked?” It was then that I smacked my head and realized I had completely forgotten about how important interlinking specific words to other posts was for a blog in terms of SEO value. Read this post L By: LucyLangdon January 27, 2009 5 Ways Obama Should Change How You Communicate Content Marketing After Obama's inauguration speech last week, a lot of attention was paid to his speechwriter, Jon Favreau. Listening to Obama and reading about how he and Favreau wrote the speech got me thinking about how we use language when writing for the web. I spent some time analysing Obama's oratory and reading about the subject. Read this post",
