The higher the keyword density the more relevant a document becomes for that term.\" The calculation used to back up this claimThe k...

Content Marketing A recent spike in traffic reminded me to keep my eye on the calendar.

Content Marketing I’m lucky, sort of. I write four blog posts a week for web design companies and a hosting company. No complaints, here. However, because I’ve been undertaking these assignments for 18 months, that works out to over 200 articles on SEO/SEM topics. At that rate, you have to slice the baloney pretty thin. So, a...

Attention Spans Are ShortThe average TV commercial is around 30 seconds to a minute long, not only because commercial time is expensive but also because that is the optimal attention span for the normal person nowadays (sadly). As you watch a commercial you'll notice that many are mini-stories, starting with a build up, resolution, and conclusion. It's important to remember yo...

Content Marketing <p>One of the most important things you can do to help create a successful web site is to build a site that provides a remarkable experience. If we look past the popular phrase \"linkbait\" (a term I don't like because of its negative connotations) we need to answer the question: \"why would someone link to our site?\".</p><p>When I first talk to a clien...

Content Marketing The number of subscribers is the main metrics of its popularity (well, I am pretty sure everyone knows that but I needed an introductory sentence:)). Recently, I've been exploring and experimenting with some creative looking blog RSS buttons and came to an interesting conclusion: no matter how unique and prominent it looks, people still tend to prefer that standard little Feedburne...

Content Marketing I remember the first time I heard about someone ending a relationship via email.
