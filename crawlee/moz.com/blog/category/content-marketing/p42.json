Content Marketing The last couple of Whiteboard Fridays, and many of the recent YOUmoz posts, have been about blogging. Rand is doing a capital job of explaining how to increase your blog visibility and move into the next league, and it’s all coming down to the same foundational point – great content. But ...

The simple answer is, absolutely. The more complicated answer is, yes absolutely, but you should also be making efforts to gain more readers. The difference are subtle, but i... Read this post By: Ann Smarty February 18, 2008 Keeping Track Of What You Read Content Marketing I am subscribed to about 100 blogs and it can take me the whole day to check the list. But to read that all (plus to check articles shared with me by my friends) is not a real issue. I’ve learned to ’scan’ posts and to quickly find useful information and news. What is challenging is to benefit from what you are reading. Like Vinny correctly pointed out in his ...

Read this post J By: John Sabia February 4, 2008 How Responsible Are Bloggers for What They Post? Content Marketing As a Realtor® in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, my interest was peeked this morning when I read about a real estate agent in Miami, Florida being sued by a developer for 25 Million because of a post on the agent’s blog. After I just about choked on my coffee, I continued to read that basically the agent while writing about the real estate market in Miami, wrote a less than favorable...

In my case, it means that I often think of the algorithms as being the engines' attempts at replicating a human brain, in so much as they try to predict what a human is likely t...

(Ok, you can have a bathroom in the locked room so you can concentrate.)You'd probably wind up with many of the features of these guys: ...

Read this post L By: LukeE January 16, 2008 Why Initial Rankings Following Quick Reporting Are Key Content Marketing In recent years, the once-common weblog or online journal has morphed into the ubiquitous blog. However, this transition led to some changes - the new terminology somehow allowed anyone to start news publication from their breakfast table. Blogging gives Joe Public the chance to jump on news before any larger entity has the chance to aggressively p...

Let me talk through the issue as I see it and then see what you think. Lets assume that you are the lucky owner of www.website.com. After spending time building up a relationship with the owner of www.blog.com they finally agree to write a blog post with a nice juicy keyword rich link...

That time of year when content writers like myself have to come up with cute new versions of festive songs from years past. After we're done beating our heads against the fake office mantelpieces hung with stockings, and have sufficiently drowned our sorrows in the bitter eggnog of trying to write lyrics that both scan properly and vaguely fit ...
