I can only imagine that SEOmoz V3 is being viewed as a major success by the SEOmoz crew. From a third-party perspective, it appears that comments have dramatically increased (although there was a little RingBait that also sucked in many warrented and well-deserv...

When it comes to indexing, it isn't that uncommon for search engines spiders to ignore parts of a site -- particularly if a site has hundreds or thousands of pages.

Content Marketing Rand sent me the above comic strip and instructed me to let it inspire me (it seems he enjoys giving me the occasional homework assignment), and the first thing I thought of when I read it was, \"Why do people blog?\" I read a lot of SEO blogs (arou...

At least one (probably the only one, hehe) of Rand's predictions is already coming true. There has been, for a while now (more than a year from what I heard), a CMS that allows you to build Digg-like platforms: PLIGG. And let me tell you, there is a bizarre TREND in most of the names - most of them are utterly funny with their &q... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 19, 2006 Everything in the Digg, Reddit & Netscape Algorithms Content Marketing At work today, Matt noted that he found Digg's algorithm far more interesting than Google's. I was shocked - after all, Digg isn't nearly as complex or widely used as Google, but with its rising popularity in the tech space, I could, at least, empathize with why he might feel that way.

With the sale to Conde Nast, Reddit has joined the ranks of social media property successes (congrats, BTW to Paul Graham & Y Combinator).

I can certainly vouch for that. An ex-client and friend of ours launched what was (at least in my opinion) a highly Digg-worthy article on the Ten Servers ...

SEOmoz has produced an average of more than 2 unique posts each day for the last couple years (~1500 posts over ~740 days) - but it's no easy task.
