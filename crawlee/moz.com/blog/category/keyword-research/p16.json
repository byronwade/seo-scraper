But there is a need to write differently for the Web and the reasons for this are quite simple: the ...

No really, what's the difference? The funny hat? Both rely on a keen understanding of the customer and the environment -- and for search marketing, it all starts with the keyword. Note: This post is a way to introduce traditional copywriters to writing with Search in mind. It follows my pr...

(Which, despite recent reports and confusion about it's demise, is going to stay online.) I've heard some people say it... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 28, 2007 Predicting Search Queries Before Demand Arrives Keyword Research In the stock market, analysts and traders buy, sell and trade shares in companies based on the speculation of future earnings or declines. Stock pickers attempt to determine which investments will rise and fall based on publicly available information. Slate magazine recently pointed out that even the best stock pickers, however, are generally terrible ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 3, 2007 Together, We Can Create an Accurate Formula for Predicting Keyword Search Volume Keyword Research An astute reader emailed me (Preston, you're a genius) to suggest that rather than attempt to collect PPC stats on our own, why not tap into the vast resource of the Internet marketing community - surely, together, we will be far stronger than we would be as just one firm. Here's the goa...

This is reduced from the normal price of $45. It only lasts two days, so take advantage of it quickly before the price goes up. Just to refresh your memory, if you're wondering what WordZe is, it's a new keyword research tool. ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 17, 2006 Keyword Research Tool Accuracy Keyword Research For a long time, the SEO world has revolved around the idea that KW volume prediction tools could only give relative levels of accuracy, i.e. term X is more popular than term Y. These tools have never been good at fulfilling their true claim - predicting search volume. I set up a campaign to test the predictions of KW research tools like KeywordDiscovery, Overture, Wordtracker, MSN, etc... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 28, 2006 Keyword Self-Cannibalization Keyword Research One of the most consistent problems I see when conducting site reviews for clients is keyword self-cannibalization - the practice of heavily targeting the same keyword phrase on multiple pages of a site. In my opinion, sites are shooting themselves in the foot when they do this. Let's look at a few quick examples: ...

Ask didn't attend (although they received an invite), but Google, Microsoft & Yahoo! all sat down (with the creators of popular blog software packages) and found a way to help make links from anonymous sources on the web separa... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 15, 2006 Keyword Research in the Long, Invisible Tail Keyword Research Since folks are angling a bit for some hardcore SEO knowledge, I thought I'd take a stab at the thorny and often unproductive process of researching keywords in the long tail.
