  "content": "M By: MitchTurck June 24, 2008 Keyword Research For Emerging Markets... Or Not Keyword Research We've all heard the buzz about Emerging Markets for a few years now, and while it's started to really crank with SMO and alternate language versions of websites, I have yet to hear anyone yet talk about KW research specifically for EM.This begs the question, is there anything worth talking about? As an SEO, my intuition tells me to start researching and securing great placem... Read this post S By: Scotie June 24, 2008 The Logical Path to Keyword Research Keyword Research Keyword research used to be a real task for me; my problem was where to start. Keyword discovery tools treat keywords like orphans and give little or no clue as to how they relate to one another or how the content they target fits into the overall information architecture of a site. Ask the client and he will wax lyrically about processes, using industry specific jargon, rather tha... Read this post By: Rishi Lakhani June 10, 2008 Building Bricks: Keyword Discovery Process for Small Businesses Keyword Research As I have often stated, I work with many small clients, especially in the medical field. There are few problems associated with this market, none of them unique, but a pain to deal with for the revenue that you make on taking on small clients.1. Explaining SEO – It’s hard enough to explain SEO processes to CEOs and corporat... Read this post By: buybigtires June 2, 2008 Queue Up: Gaining a Competive Edge By Optimising for Colloquialisms Keyword Research My company is very focused on the global marketplace. Thus far this year, we've targeted the Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and British languages in search results. If you're playing \"One of these things is not like the other...\" you probably feel the urge to inform me that \"British\" just doesn't belong. On the technical merit of your argument, I woul... Read this post By: Danny Dover April 22, 2008 The Beginner's Checklist for Small Business SEO Keyword Research For the last three months I have been hard at work learning SEO by optimizing a local small business website. The business is called Giggly Wiggly Preschool and is located in the Seattle suburb Issaquah, Washington. This Issaquah Preschool was the preschool I attended many years ago so I am happy I was given the chance to give bac... Read this post By: Ann Smarty January 9, 2008 Keyword Research Tools: An Extended List Keyword Research I've been coming across keyword research posts now and then and decided to make up an extended list of the tools which appeared particularly useful for me. 1) Google Adwords Tool for keyword suggestions (well, this one is used by everyone here, so it does not require a long explanation) - I always h... Read this post By: Richard Baxter January 7, 2008 The Long Tail of Search in the Recruitment Business Keyword Research Recruitment websites are full of constantly evolving, fresh content in the shape of new vacancies. The big UK recruitment agencies (not to be confused with “jobs boards”) can have as many as 1000 jobs at any one time live on the site. Better still, there’s always a few new jobs posted every time the site gets crawled. So how do you take advantage of the traffic generati... Read this post By: Ann Smarty November 29, 2007 Discover and Track Your Long Tail Patterns Keyword Research I promised Gabriel to come up with the article and so here it is. I decided to share with SEOMoz members my technique to catch up the targeted Long Tail. I used to work in the celebrity niche promoting an entertainment ecommerce site and that's where blogging was one of the most effective solutions to build the brand and generate both tra... Read this post By: Gabriel Goldenberg November 5, 2007 Replacing Overture Inventory with Estimated Google Inventory Keyword Research As most of you likely know, Yahoo stopped updating Overture's inventory data in January 2007. Besides the issues this may cause for those relying on it for research on seasonal terms (that boxingdayspecials.com buy isn't looking so hot anymore, huh?), it means that search marketers have at best outdated information in the volume of searches carried out for a given keyword in a given mon... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 18, 2007 An Exhaustive List of Search Engine Based Keyword Research Data Keyword Research Rather than trying to make this post go through all the tactics and specifics of Rebecca's already comprehensive KW Research article, I figured I'd instead provide a solid list of every which way you can look at a keyword to get an idea of metrics, value and potential from the engines themselves (rather than services like AdWords, YSM, Wortracker or KW Discovery). This is more of an \"exper... Read this post K By: Kat French August 17, 2007 Most Likely to Succeed, or the High School Guide to Keyword Selection Keyword Research It turns out, I managed to learn something extremely valuable about SEO back when I was in high school. Which is odd, given that I graduated in 1991. It was my senior year, all my friends had been in the class of 1990, and I was taken suddenly by an uncharacteristic desire to make my mark on my small rural high school. After toying briefly with the prospect of toil... Read this post By: Hamlet Batista June 4, 2007 Uncovering the Invisible Long Tail Keyword Research Most SEOs are hard-set on chasing the “head keywords” -- the very popular ones. Others are starting to pay more attention to the long tail. Now, how many are actually pursuing the invisible long tail? “At Google's Universal Search announcement,... Read this post P By: Patricia Skinner May 17, 2007 The Bare Essentials of Highly Effective Keyword Research Keyword Research An essential component of any SEO campaign is picking the right keywords. Unfortunately, many people don’t really understand the concepts behind picking keywords. I’ve seen many people, even so-called SEO experts, who think it’s just a matter of coming up with a few randomly-chosen phrases relevant to the page subject. Nothing could be further from the truth.... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley May 3, 2007 Don't Set It and Forget It! Use That List of Keywords! Keyword Research Matt McGee (who I owe a link to for winning the SEO group NCAA tournament bracket back in March...damn you, Florida) wrote a fantastic post over at Small Business SEM called \"I Have My Keywords...Now What?\" It's concise, it's to the point, it's magical.
