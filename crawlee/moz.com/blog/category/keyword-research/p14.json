Little did I know that this would result in a morning of maths. Monday morning to be precise. Monday maths morning. I might make that a recurring theme. This post is going to be all about the adcente... Read this post D By: DavidHorne June 29, 2009 How To Analyze Keyword Difficulty - Tooless! Keyword Research There is a lot of information on the web on how to do the basics of SEO yet it took me years to figure out the right way to analyze Keyword Difficulty. I think there are a few reasons for this. One being that it’s a difficult subject to explain and it’s a lot more complicated than it looks. I know there is a keyword difficulty tool from SEOMoz (htt...

If you are in a niche market, this approach may be perfectly fine but when you have a site that plays in m... Read this post S By: saurav_kneoteric June 11, 2009 How Not to Judge Keyword Competition Keyword Research I have been witness to many instances wherein people have judged the competitiveness of a keyphrase by simply searching it in Google, and then checking the total number of search results. For them the total number of results is a measure of the competitiveness of a given keyphrase. I could have understood if they were people who are new to SEO, but I have also seen many SEO practitioners do exactly the same. This post will attempt to clear this misconception.

Keyword Research If you're like me, you use the SEOmoz Tools on a regular basis. An old favorite of mine is the Keyword Difficulty tool. If you've used this tool, you know that it requires input from the Wordtracker Keyword Suggestion Tool. WordTracker has been around since the early days of search marketing. Read this post By: Matt Lambert March 5, 2009 Upside Down Marketing Keyword Research Instinctively, without thinking, earlier on this evening I clicked a 'thumbs down' against Rand's video post about buckets of keywords. Of course, it means I have to write a post to explain my dastardly act of down thumbing, and having listened again to see if I was just being mean, my view is now that actually I probably don't know. Maybe.

In some cases the numbers reported are similar, but in most cases the monthly traffic numbers appear to very different, with the SBWKT numbers being only a fraction of the ADKWT. Here are some examples taken from a \"business intelligence\" search with each tool. Read this post B By: Budi Waluyo December 10, 2008 Offline Keyword Research for Local Languages Keyword Research In mid-June 2008, I met my friend who has a canvas painted shoes boutique. She requested me to make a blog that promotes her painted shoes boutique. One of the challenges I came across when building the blog was the keyword research, as none of the online keyword research tools I used were able to return good results of searches for our local language (Indonesia). The tools always showed \"0\" or \"not available.\" The experience made me doubt that there was a market share available for her product over the internet.

It's merely a hypothetical, and any research or insight you've got is more than welcome in the comments.In commenting on a recent SEOmoz post, I recalled querying Google for a result that began \"why did...\", ... Read this post By: buybigtires November 3, 2008 The Island of Dr. Yahoogle, or The Reverse Directory Hypothesis Keyword Research Lately, the search engines seem to have become more intelligent. I say this because the suggestions they make seem to be more accurate. Now, this obviously goes back to a human decision to leverage data that had already been collected, rather than a vast improvement in the suggestion engine.

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 24, 2008 Optimizing for Multiple Word Order Search Phrases Keyword Research SEOmoz member, Michael Janik wrote to me last week and asked about how to optimize for multiple word order search phrases. I think it's an excellent topic, and one that we haven't covered well in the past. The issue arises from keyword phrases that receive search queries in different formats, for example: Restaurant Reviews Seattle...

The obvious short cut is to ask the client, he knows what he wants; he is an expert on market research, he has analysed all the sites that compete in his search space, he has sat down and analysed his AdWords campaign and culled the dodo’s, ...
