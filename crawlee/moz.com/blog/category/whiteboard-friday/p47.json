  "content": "By: Aaron Wheeler November 11, 2010 Search Engines and Brand Entities Whiteboard Friday Brands and company-specific brand name products have become much more important to search engines recently. Google tries to serve us with relevant content, so if it thinks we want to know more about Adidas or Puma, it's going to tell us about these brands rather than about the random online shoe stores that we'll probably click away from (you know the ones!).

Read this post By: Aaron Wheeler October 7, 2010 Making \"Reference\" Content Rank Well in the SERPs Whiteboard Friday I've always liked encyclopedias; when I was in middle school I started using Encarta on CD-ROM, and sure, I usually needed it for \"help\" with my homework, but sometimes I would stray to non-copy-and-pasting-from-encyclopedia activities and watch terribly animated videos of war battles or Shakespearean plays. My poor children will never know the joys of a succinct five page article on the American Revolution with an accompanying 30-second 160 X 200 resolution video! Anyways, if my aforementioned future kids do end up needing to write about the American Revolution, and you have a great site about it, how can you make sure they end up seeing your content? This week, Rand discusses some great ways to get your reference content to the top of the SERPs.
