Our firm has worked for several medium to large private companies, but lately we've been contacted by some publicly traded corporations. This can put a savvy SEO/Investor in a precarious situation. Knowing the success that our clients have achieved with our SEO campaigns, it can be tempting to ta... Read this post By: Sarah Bird March 24, 2008 Copyright: Sample Forms and Strategies for Registering your Online Content E-Commerce SEO I'm going to divide up the registration process into three parts because each application should include three things: (1) The Completed Application; (2) A Sample or Copy of the Work; and (3) the fee. Part One: The Completed Application Applications to register copyright are actually very short and pretty intuitive. Regardless, many people break out into a cold sweat at the thought of completing a copyright application. I have a feeling the paper part is what holds most people back. Because \"seeing is believing,\" I am sharing with you the copyright applications I have created to get SEOmoz up to date on its copyright registration.

This is the largest cash settlement since the inception of the Can-Spam Act in 2003. In addition, Valueclick is barred from future violations of the Can-Spam Act. It must also place conspicuous disclaimers indicating that consumers are required to participate and spend money on other obligations in order to qualify for \"free\" promotions. The settlement also requires them to provide a list of the obligations â€“ such as applying for credit cards, purchasing products, or obtaining a car loan â€“ that consumers must incur to qualify for a free product. Valueclick must also put in place strict measures to protect consumer information. Valueclick's compliance with these measure must be monitored by an independent party for 20 years. Read this post By: Sarah Bird March 9, 2008 Trademark Law and Domain Names: ACPA or UDRP? E-Commerce SEO Today I want to discuss how trademark law plays out in the course of a domain name dispute. We're going to compare and contract the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act with I-CANN's Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy. As I see it, there are generally three kinds of domain name disputes. They are as follows: 1. Cybersquatting: You own a trademark and someone without a right to the mark is exploiting your mark in bad faith. 2. Two trademark holders, one domain name: You own a trademark, but someone else owns the same mark too and there is only one domain name. 3. No one owns the trademark, but everybody wants the brand: Not all domain names are trademark protected, but people inappropriately attempt to use trademark law to resolve domain name issues. While discussing each prototypical domain name dispute, we will also discover the different statutes and dispute resolution procedures available in domain name disputes.

How do I get some? â†’ Be First in Your Market â†’ Be Distinctive â‡’Trademark Law's Guiding Principle: Don't Confuse the Consumer â‡’ Limitations on Trademark Rights â†’ Trademark does not protect disparaging or lewd marks. â†’ Trademark holders do not â€œownâ€ the words, logos, or sloganâ€™s themselves. â†’ Parodies of trademarks are permissible. â†’ Non-commercial uses are permissible. â†’ News reporting and product comparisons are permissible. â‡’ Caution!

Duffy, one of RipOff Report's attorneys to contact me with any corrections, feedback, documents, or missed cases that he thought might be helpful. I am very grateful to him for taking me up on my offer and contacting me last week. The phone call lasted for more than an hour. For today's Legal Monday, I want to summarize five of Mr. Duffy's responses.

It's happened to me. It's happened to you. And it'll probably happen to this post too. (Oh, the irony!) What can you do when your copyright is being infringed? Don't get sad. Get letter-writing mad! There are four ways to stop someone from stealing your content. Before we dive into each of those methods, I want to preemptively address some caveats, complicating factors, and limitations of the \"four methods\" approach. Read this post By: Sarah Bird January 9, 2008 Network Solutions Exploits I-CANN's Five-Day Refund Rule to Hoard Domains E-Commerce SEO Today, there are allegations flying around today that Network Solutions, a very popular internet registrar, has been exploiting that same five-day-refund rule to park domains and then sell them at an increased fee. If the allegations are true, then Network Solutions was operating a very cunning business. Here's how the scheme worked: Network Solutions would track what domains people were searching for. With this actionable intelligence in hand, it would quickly purchase those domains and park them. When an interested party went back online to purchase the domain, they would discover that Network Solutions had already registered it. Of course, Network Solutions was willing to sell it to them for a fee. This fee was more expensive than other competing registrars typically offer. Alternatively, if the interested party did not come back online to purchase the domain within five days, Network Solutions would simply take advantage of I-CANN's refund policy and void it's own registration. No cash out of their pockets!

Dell did everything right to put itself in a good position for this lawsuit. Unfortunately, documents filed with the court last Friday, January 5, 2008 indicate that Dell may lose the case despite its efforts. Part I of this post talks about Dell v BelgiumDomains, LLC. Part II of this post asks a few questions about domain tasting.

Read this post By: Sarah Bird December 11, 2007 What's Fair About Fair Use? Defending a Copyright Infringement Claim E-Commerce SEO â‡’ What is \"fair use\"? â‡’ Does the fair use defense only work in the United States? â‡’ How does fair use related to trademark, copyright and patent law? â‡’ What's the big deal about fair use? Why do we care? â‡’ There are four factors to consider when determining whether you are illegally infringing someoneâ€™s copyright or merely employing fair use of the material: â†’ The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is nor nonprofit educational purposes; â†’ The nature of the copyrighted work. â†’ The amount and substantially of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and â†’ The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. â‡’ But I thought I had a First Amendment Right to free speech. â‡’ Specific Applications. â†’ Can I quote someone on my website? â†’ Can I post someone elseâ€™s graphic on my website if I give credit to them? â†’ Is my software vulnerable to fair use? â†’ Is parody considered â€œfair useâ€?

That's right. If you don't register, you could end up in the hole, even if you win. Alternatively, you could register, get your attorneys fees paid for and maybe actually get some cash back in your pocket. I think this post is worth your time, don't you? So, let's all take a deep breath, grab our caffeinated beverages of choice, and jump back into the exciting and riveting world of copyright registration. Read this post",
