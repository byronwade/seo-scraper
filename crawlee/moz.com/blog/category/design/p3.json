Read this post By: Darren Slatten November 6, 2008 Microsoft Forces Me to Hate Internet Explorer Design I found a quote recently that really embodies my sentiments about Microsoft's Internet Explorer: \"If IE6 were a person, I'd punch that person in the face.\" Whose famous words are these?

Read this post D By: Devin Mills October 20, 2008 Elements of a Great Website Design Plenty of big companies have Flash websites, you might think, so why not yours? The answer is simple. Complicated Flash websites won't help you sell anything. Think back to the animated sites you've seen in the past. They might look nice, but they load slowly, especially for users on slow connections. They can also be awkward to navigate, and they make it difficult for users to bookmark specific pages they'd like to return to. If the purpose of your website is to function like a television commercial, then make is as flashy as you want. Lexus, for example, doesn't sell cars from their website and most of the people who visit their website already know the Lexus brand; therefore, they do not care about a good search engine ranking. People know if they want to find out about Lexus, they can go to www.lexus.com. If your goal for your website is to be listed on the first page of Google, market and sell products, and take money from your customers, you will need a simple and easy to understand design that is search engine friendly.

Read this post I By: IndyMediaGroup September 18, 2008 How Flash Affects Your Website's Ranking with SEO Design I recently talked to a prospective client about building his site to promote his photography services. He wanted to use a service by blusites.com which charges no more than $400 for a completely built out site targeted to photographers all in flash.
