  "content": "By: Rand Fishkin November 15, 2006 The Multiheader - A Huge Trend in Homepage Design Design One of the biggest changes to homepages across the web, particularly with big brands, is the seemingly mandatory inclusion of the multiheader. Multiheaders allows multiple stories or features access to the primary visibility section of a homepage, and let visitors choose (through a click or hover) which featured piece they want to see. Let's take a walk through a few: ... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley October 10, 2006 Why Good Content is Like a Pixar Film Design SEO blogs have been preaching the same old spiel again and again: have good content on your site. It's no secret, yet for many businesses, it seems hard to implement. I thought I'd change the argument up a bit and put it in perspective the only way I know how: by using movies as an analogy. Good content is like a Pixar film. Pixar films fall into the \"You Have to be a Jerk to Not ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 9, 2006 5 Creative E-Commerce Processes Worth Imitating Design I've been watching Mystery Guest shop online a bit over the weekend (while drinking beer and observing manly NFL games) and I was surprised to see so many \"web 2.0\" features on the e-commerce sites she browsed. More interesting still were how the numerous breaks from convention appeared to enhance, rather than detract, from the buying experience. Traditionally...

Splash pages are the pages that the user sees before they actually get to a website; typically, they're flash and offer some kind of introductory animation. The user clicks \"Skip Intro&qu...

Design Recently I've started working with Rand on doing site analyses for our clients. He's taken me under his wing by walking me through a typical site analysis and telling me what to look for. Obviously, since Rand is the resident expert, it is easy for him to know what to look for and what to recommend to the client.Unfortunately, up until I started working for SEOmoz, I was accustomed to ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 25, 2006 Link Density - A Method for Increasing Page Views Design A friend of mine runs a content-based website monetized largely through page views. He recently shared a tactic with me that's been immensely successful in improving the number of page views per visit. His terminology - \"link density.\" Link density refers specifically to the placement and number of links on a content page. For example, this page on ... Read this post J By: Jeff Pollard August 18, 2006 Helping to Build the Web: A Day in the Life of a Web Developer Design When people ask me what I do, I tell them that I am a \"Web Developer\". It's more accurate than \"Web Designer\" and much less narcissistic than \"Webmaster.\" Even still, people have a hard time grasping what I do every day at my job. I'm sure if you asked 3 very important people in my life -- my girlfriend, mother, and best friend -- what I did at work every day... Read this post J By: Jeff Pollard August 17, 2006 How to use AJAX: 5 Real World Examples Design I've always subscribed to the \"content, content, content\" philosophy of developing successful web sites. In my former life as a freelance web developer, I've far too often seen clients get neck deep in logo and font choices -- subsequently ignoring the main reason they got on the web in the first place: content. Unless you have useful, reliable and frequently updated content,... Read this post K By: katfive July 31, 2006 Livejournal's Awesome 404 Error Design When dealing with client recommendations for design, usability, and accessibility, we always stress the importance of a custom 404 page. Why? Because I think everyone gets a little sick of seeing standard pages that do little to direct users toward a useful solution. These boring, default 404s are not friendly, they're hostile. And without the proper presentation they risk scaring away less savvy ... Read this post O By: Oatmeal July 20, 2006 How to Ruin a Web Design - The Design Curve Design As a professional web designer I've noticed a consistent trend in the majority of the projects I've worked on: The more time that is spent dissecting, analyzing, and critiquing a design by the wrong kinds of people the worse that design gets. The same trend applies to the number of people involved in the design process.Group intelligence is multiplicative when id...
