  "content": "By: Rebecca Kelley May 10, 2006 Is There Such a Thing as Too Much Accessibility? Design I've been working on a site audit for the past week or so and have come to an exhaustively thorough section regarding usability and accessibility. While I'm not denying that this sort of information is extremely valuable when optimizing a website, my question to you guys is how much information is too much? How much information about making a site disabled user-friendly should a client receive? Ho... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 9, 2006 Crafting Compelling Home Pages Design Bare Naked App kindly pointed out that Skype's home page is one of the most compelling, well written homepages ever created. They properly target their audience, make the site fun, easy-to-learn and hard to resist. And, to top it off, the video walkthrough of Skype's service is pr... Read this post E By: Ella_D April 27, 2006 Poor IE users: Microsoft's Loss Means Active/Flash Elements are Now Less Accessible Design I had to shout out loud on this one, though ZDNET also wrote a nice article about it. Believe it or not, IE's latest update (went through roughly 10 days ago) has created havoc on the web, for both web designers and end-users. As I type, anyone using Internet Explorer now has to \"activate\" any flash or active-x element related to their ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 19, 2006 Where are all the Great Designers? Design Many, many folks who contact us are seeking re-development of their website. When Matt doesn't have the time to put together one of his gorgeous designs for them, it's been very tough for me to point people in the right direction to hire a talented designer who can use CSS effectively and create a standards-compliant site (I don't recommend it as much for t... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 18, 2006 Website Prototyping Software Design When building out the page-by-page wireframing of a new website, I've been prone to use Macromedia Flash to layout the elements and create the idea that customers and developers can see. A friend recently suggested Axure, software that's specifically designed for wireframing websites and has a lot of built-in functionality to support the task of prototyping.... Read this post O By: Oatmeal April 4, 2006 CSS Inspiration Design If you're thinking about putting together a pure CSS driven site and need inspiration, I've compiled a short list of my favorite CSS showcases. I use these sites not only to inspire visual ideas, but also to learn more creative and practical ways to use CSS. I often find myself digging through source code of sites in the showcases discovering good (and bad) CSS ... Read this post E By: EGOL March 13, 2006 Aggressive Use of Your Homepage Design Lots of sites have a very simple homepage design. Google is a perfect example of this. However, I have found that loading up the homepage with information has increased sales, pageviews, visitor time-on-site, and linkbuild rate. (Rand and Matt's new design for seomoz.org - shown at right ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 8, 2006 WeeWorld Profiles & Visual Communities Design I'm particularly fond of WeeWorld - I love the illustration style, the feel of the interface and the thinking behind it - that we can all have an online identity that follows us from place to place. The concept of an avatar has been around since the nascent beginnings of web forums, but to have a community of identities that allow for customization, represe... Read this post O By: Oatmeal February 23, 2006 Recommendations for a site search engine? Design I need recommendations for a site search engine that does the following: Spiders your site's content to X levels deep Build a database of page titles, urls, and content Provide a searchable front-end that is easily customizable to match an existing site I could write my own. It'd just be a simple spider program that spid... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 23, 2006 Wufoo - Woo Hoo! Design For those of us who have to constantly reference HTML form help pages to create new forms for websites and surveys, there's nothing better than this cool new \"AJAX\" automated form builder. It's intuitive, easy-to-use, well designed and very flexible.... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 21, 2006 AJAX vs. Comet Design A few days ago at HighRankings there was a thread asking about AJAX's use to develop websites. I chimed in with my $0.02 only to find that many folks in SEO are, apparently, unfamiliar with the new technolo... Read this post E By: EGOL February 20, 2006 Vanishing Affiliate Links Design I have some affiliate sites and recently received two messages from site visitors who were interested in making a purchase but could not figure out how to click through to the purchase page. I chalked the first one up to some cranky person who didn't know how to run a br... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 13, 2006 Readability Indices Design Irishwonder pointed me to his blog post on the subject of readability indices. He's referencing a nifty little tool that you can use on your own pages as well as comparing the readability levels of various SEO/M industry blogs (we're ranked 3... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 11, 2006 Clever Buttons Design I like the idea behind this button site. From buttons for sushi and coffee to wishlists, geographies and politics, they've got a very wide selection. Take this concept, apply it to other graphics, text, content, games, programs, etc. and you've go... Read this post",
