This is one of those posts that will appeal to some people quite nicely and make others yell \"linkbait\" - which happens pretty much anytime SEOmoz publishes something in a list format. Hopefully you'll enjoy the break from our usual: Basic Equations Great Writing/Multimedia/Tools + Interesting Subjec... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley January 10, 2007 How We Used to Manage Tasks and Clients, and What We Did to Improve Online Advertising As much as SEOmoz has been growing lately (both in success and in employees), we still have a long way to go before we become an optimal, efficient, streamlined business (this may involve racing stripes and a spoiler, but no spinning rims). However, though we're still trying to attain the status of Grand Poobah Organizers, we have, believe it or not, vastly improved our business practices. Let's t...

As starters, I’m going to run a short summary about the market area because I think most SEOMoz readers are US based and with limited knowledge about Europe as market area.
