My goal is to use ethical search engine optimization to get it ranked in Google SERPs. SEO professional is the domain. It's also a good domain for a personal branding site. That's why I used ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 30, 2009 5 Common Pieces of SEO Advice I Disagree With Online Advertising Over the years, I've heard a number of recommendations for SEO given out that I simply don't understand or find logically flawed. I thought it might be interesting to share some of these and hear more perspectives. It could be that I just don't comprehend the reasoning or haven't thought things through, but I personally don't recommend these, so it's worth at least a discussion. #1... Read this post By: Danny Dover August 18, 2009 Early Detection: How Social Media May Save The World Online Advertising It is a typical Tuesday afternoon in suburbia California. Jenny, a sixteen year old girl is taking a sick day from school. With a runny nose, she sits idly on her bed surfing Facebook. At the same time, 2,000 miles away in Seattle, a twenty-two year old ambitious college drop-out named Kevin is on Twitter complaining about his sore throat. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, a 40 year...

Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley May 26, 2009 Internet Marketing in the Movies: Are People Starting to \"Get\" It? Online Advertising Since I'm a movie buff and an Internet marketing nerd, I often notice Internet marketing and search mentions in various movies, and I always pay attention to the movie URL shown in trailers (my two recent favorites: the URL for Sacha Baron Cohen's upcoming Bruno film was www.meinspace.com/bruno, but it looks like now it's redirecting to MySpace.com, and the URL for I Love You, Beth Cooper is www.iloveyoubethcoopermovie.com, making me wonder why they had to append \"movie\" to such a specific URL). Recently I came across two examples where the movie industry referenced or directly utilized Internet marketing/social media marketing, and it got me wondering if Internet marketing is finally starting to become more mainstream (meaning fewer people will look at you with blank faces as you try to describe what you do for a living). Read this post A By: Aaron Bronow May 21, 2009 URL Rewriting: Increase Organic Traffic By Using Dynamic URLs That Look Static Online Advertising If you haven't noticed URL rewriting, you haven't been thinking like a search engine optimizer. More and more sites are using this technology to create human-readable (and SEO-friendly) URLs. If your site is one of them, good for you. Read on and you might find some reassuring data to back up your excellent decision. If you are not familiar with how URL rewriting will improve organic search ranking and traffic to your site, I don't blame you. It's not a hard concept to grasp, but it's rarely covered well in SEO publications. Few sites are using it, and this creates an opportunity for you to get ahead in ranking. If you have any search competition, you should already be thinking about how to improve the way you present data to engines. Read this post S By: saurav_kneoteric May 13, 2009 Competitive Data Acquisition and Analysis Online Advertising You may control all aspects of your website, but there are numerous factors beyond site optimization and measurement that impact your revenue directly. New firms seemingly come out of oblivion, and new technologies and approaches preempt existing businesses. More often than not, the damage inflicted in terms of revenue is due to competitors’ actions. In a global survey conducted by Fuld & Company, two-third of the respondents affirmed that their organizations had been caught off-guard by as many as three high-impact episodes in the last five years. A staggering 97% of the respondents admitted that their companies do not have an early warning system in place. Ignorance is no more bliss – what you don't know can hurt you. Read this post By: Matthew Kerridge April 29, 2009 The Tender Process - Do Customers Ever Get It Right? Online Advertising Despite the doom and gloom reported in the wider economy, our agency has had the busiest start to the year I can remember, with an unprecedented number of invitation to tender requests. We're long enough in the tooth not to go for every tender, but even so our experience of completing these has varied enormously, with some being so badly run that I was prompted to write this post. Read this post By: Brandon Na March 17, 2009 Top Collegiate Marketing Programs Get an 'F' for SEO Online Advertising Pondering whether some extra certification or credentials might help land me the next opportune gig, I perused through some of the Top 10 Marketing Departments (according to US News 2009) to see what they had to offer. Given they are the \"BEST Marketing programs in the nation,\" you would think they would have a clue about the Internet being an important medium, if not the most efficient and most powerful marketing medium in history. Read this post D By: Darren Savery March 14, 2009 Visitor Statistics After 1 Year of Business Online Advertising Approximately a year ago, I decided to start my own website - a semiconductor supplier directory company called Semi-Directory. I admit it’s a bit of a dry topic, but please bear with me as this post isn’t about the site per se. Instead, I thought it might be a good idea to share my progress over the last 12 months, and provide evidence that SEO actually works! (duh - as though you didn’t know that already). Still, it’s nice to see tangible evidence that this is the case now and again. Right? Read this post",
