  "content": "By: Pete Watson-Wailes March 10, 2009 My Wish For All Those Reading This Online Advertising Dear Reader, I've been in this industry a fair while. Long enough to have been a consultant, and work for an agency, and run my own company. Fair to say, I've been around the block. Consider this then a few words of wisdom from someone who hopes you, whoever you may be, dear reader, may have a measure of success too. Read this post By: Danny Dover March 2, 2009 The Internet Marketer's Checklist For Determining If a Business Idea is Worth Pursuing Online Advertising Starting a company is a lot like streaking. Coming up with the idea and brainstorming the execution is exciting but performing the action is difficult and rarely done well. I, like a lot of people, have had my mind hijacked by a new business idea that fools me into believing I came up with the next big thing. Unfortunately, most of these plans ended in complete failure. As soon as I started to make progress I would inevitably run into an unforeseen problem that would, like a bad streaking plan, leave me embarrassed and out of breath. Read this post By: Melissa Fach - @SEOAware February 26, 2009 Being Found Is Crucial, But Keeping the Visitor is Just as Crucial Online Advertising We all know how important SEO is. Our clients need to be found, but once our clients get a visitor they must convince them to invest. With a B.A. and M.A. based on Psychology, I look at things a little differently when working for clients: * How do we create trust? * How do we please the visual learner and the non-visual learner? * What needs to be said to convince a user to spend their money? Read this post B By: Ben Toth February 11, 2009 Crushing Your Enemies with Their Own Brand Online Advertising I know it's a pretty simple concept, but I've been more or less obsessed with pushing people to target competitors' brand names lately. It's come up in about half of my recent conversations, and the thing that I don't understand is what a hard sell it is to people. Read this post A By: Alhan Keser February 4, 2009 How RSS Feeds Make Me Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger Online Advertising I love you, Really Simple Syndication. And I love you too, Atom. And if you are a social media marketer, an SEO or just someone who is tracking a company's online presence, then you probably feel the same way. Using RSS feeds to consolidate sources of information is nothing new to most marketers, but I figured I would write this for those who have not yet discovered the power of RSS. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 1, 2009 Business Assets + Historical Tracking = Serious Value Online Advertising One of the areas we rarely touch on here at SEOmoz is how to use your offline, general business assets for SEO. Today I want to tackle that along with the seemingly unrelated subject of watching historical progress. At the end of this excercise, I think you'll see why these two tie together so nicely. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 15, 2009 The 6 Goals of SEO: Choosing the Right Ones for Your Business Online Advertising Virtually everyone who's engaged seriously in the practice of search engine optimization has found it to have surprisingly versatile results. Site owners will often start out optimizing in order to rank for a particular term/phrase that's relevant to getting customers, only to find that secondary and tertiary benefits from branding to reputation management to raw traffic all have an impact. Today I'd like to cover the different applications of SEO and talk about how to choose the right SEO objectives for your business. Read this post A By: Alan Bleiweiss December 29, 2008 Growing Your Internet Marketing Business in a Down Economy Online Advertising The economy is in the tank. Hundreds of thousands of people are losing jobs every month. Unprecedented numbers of people are losing their homes. Yet we, as Internet Marketing Professionals, are blessed to be in the right market at the right time. Read this post D By: Dan Crean December 18, 2008 Be Quantitative Online Advertising As a profession, we should always be as quantitative as possible. We work with limited information, but that shouldn't be an excuse for throwing up our hands. Even an estimate, if it is quantitative, can be useful in both guiding marketing tactics and communicating with co-workers and clients. Read this post K By: Kat French December 9, 2008 Tips for SMOs and SEMs Working in a Traditional/Transitioning Ad Agency Online Advertising Well, folks, let’s face it. The economy is tanking like the Titanic. While many traditional advertising agencies have been dragging their feet and playing “wait and see” when it comes to adding online marketing disciplines like SEO, PPC, Email and Social Media Marketing to their list of services, the smart ones realize that these services represent a viable ... Read this post S By: Sarah Carling December 5, 2008 Content with the Content Network? Online Advertising It's a long time since I used the content network. I've always thought that it is a bit of a waste of time. All those impressions, no conversions -- it hardly seemed worth the effort. I have been reconsidering my stance of late though. The problem is that I have been viewing it as a paid search platform, but perhaps that's not really where it sits. Perhaps what it really wants to be is an affiliate platform. Read this post P By: Paz December 4, 2008 Things I Hate About Internet Advertising Online Advertising When you are a small business, you obviously have to be very careful about where you invest your time and your money. Recently I have been looking at some further advertising opportunities -- definitely not paid links, but genuine advertising in industry-related portals -- and I came across one or two repeated scenarios that have me pulling my hair out. A few examples of what makes me cross: Read this post By: Matthew Kerridge December 1, 2008 Should SEO Agencies Exist and Are Their Days Numbered? Online Advertising I was looking through the service offerings of the UK top 100 digital agencies (http://top100.nma.co.uk/section.php?section_id=1) and musing on the state of the industry. One observation that can be made is how the number of technical, creative and increasingly digital media agencies are offering SEO services, something that a few years ago certainly wasn’t the case. Read this post By: Paul Lalley November 19, 2008 Content Syndication and How to Look Good Doing It Online Advertising Content syndication comes straight from page 63 of the Rules of SEO, so most Mozzarati know what it’s about. A brief primer: content syndicators accept informational content from writers (or at least people familiar with the alphabet) and post these articles for download by webmasters. Read this post",
