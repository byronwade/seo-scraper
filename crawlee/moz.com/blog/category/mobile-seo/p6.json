Personally, my list of top articles to read around the changes (and directional focii) Google brought up yesterday is: Vanessa Fox's coverage of Google's Support for Microformats and Rich Snippets... Read this post L By: Luke Shiras April 27, 2009 Stop Wasting the Web Mobile SEO A recent discussion on using short URLs prompted me to consider registering a short URL for various redirecting purposes. I wanted to see if there were any usable .US domains left so I started trying out different names. Since I had some time to kill and don’t really have an automated way to search, I just started typing in names I thought would be interesting.

A lot of our members have expressed interest in buying old domains for a variety of prices (some are cheap, some are going for upwards of $50k) and want some advice on what to do with the domains once they've been purchased. I'm no domainer, nor am I an expert in such a business tactic, but I generally recommend one of three different options for an expired domain (and would love to hear more if you've got any).

Mobile SEO For the purposes of this thought experiment, let’s ignore the benefits of diversification and assume you can have either a million dollars worth of real estate (say an apartment building or a lot of land) or a million dollars worth of one or more websites. Which would you prefer?

This entry was very much prompted by a recent Q&A dealing with member only sites. You know the ones - limited content to titillate potential subscribers and the rest is locked up behind pay-walls. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 25, 2008 7 Good Twitter Monetization Strategies (and 7 That Suck) Mobile SEO I've been getting into Twitter (under my usual moniker - randfish) more and more over time (despite only following a few friends and family), and lately, its been weighing on me that the service, despite its brilliance, rapid adoption and passionate fanbase, isn't yet pursuing revenue. That's OK - I think they probably have lots of very smart, talented,... Read this post K By: Karen Browning-Cutler November 24, 2008 Something's Up with Live Search. Period. Mobile SEO I use Advanced Web Ranking. It does a great job of taking care of the necessary evil of rank monitoring. It runs automatically, has very easy set up, and emulates human search for us unfortunates without a SOAP API. I was checking some site rankings the other day and noticed that a few of our sites had completely dropped from MSN. Investigating manually, I saw this result for \"st. augustine weddings\": Read this post A By: amplified-media October 6, 2008 SEO Wireframing Mobile SEO I’ve received a few queries about optimizing new website builds - keeping SEO clearly at the forefront of the design.I though it might be a good idea to write about this as my first contribution to the YOUMoz community. Here is how I tackle it. Whenever I am approached for SEO on a new site build I set to work on constructing an SEO WireFrame...

We recently wrote a post on the Live Search Webmaster Blog asking what is wrong with the ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 8, 2008 Re-Building My Firefox Sidebar (and Ranking the SEO Blogs) Mobile SEO In November of last year, I updated my Firefox Sidebar to contain all the sites and tools on the web I regularly need. Today, I've done that again and, in the process, re-compiled and re-ordered my list of search-related blogs according to my personal preferences. Since I'm heading out of town for 2 weeks starting Tuesday (getting married, then a short vacation), this should give anyone who's i... Read this post By: Jane Copland August 22, 2008 Keeping People Away From Your Website: A Beginner's Guide Mobile SEO Many of you have probably set your SEOmoz account settings such that when you comment on a blog post, we email you whenever someone adds a new comment. One thing we don't do is include the contents of the new comment in the notification email. Why not? Because then you would have less reason to click through to see the comment in its natural habitat and you'd be less likely to reply. The ...

Being a huge fan of search technology and how search engines work in general, I've been spending some time playing around with the new service and thought it would be valuable to expose my data on how the classic market leaders - Google, Yahoo!, Live & Ask compare to the newcomer. When judging the value and performance... Read this post S By: sarita-55215 July 24, 2008 The Site Was About...uh, It Was Orange? Mobile SEO The site had orange headers, a three column layout with two vertical thin black lines, no content below the fold, top and bottom navigation and a logo in the upper left corner. I used this site early in the week, and several days later I only vaguely remembered what the site was about. The site did not rank well enough on a short-tailed keyword for a successful search. The week was research h... Read this post By: Jane Copland July 23, 2008 Comments: The Window To A Website's Soul Mobile SEO ... Read this post",
