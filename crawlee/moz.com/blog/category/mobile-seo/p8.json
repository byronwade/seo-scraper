  "content": "By: Rebecca Kelley October 23, 2007 MSN's site: command is Confusing Me... Mobile SEO I'm working on a site review for a client, and I was checking to see how well the site was indexed across the major search engines. Normally we do a site: command and skip to the last page of results to get as accurate a count as we can; however, MSN's count is a little puzzling. When I first performed a count, it said the client's site had 180 pages indexed (it's a brand new site). Jumping to the... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 14, 2007 The 5 Websites You Can't Live Without Mobile SEO I'm halfway through my next post on rewriting the Beginner's Guide, but I'm just too tired to go on. Losing three hours coming over to New York doesn't help, either. So, I've turned my attention away from the project for now and thought I'd ask something a bit more participatory of the crowd here... What are the 5 industry-related websites (excluding the search engines themselves) that ...

Continuing the theme from buybigtires' post at the beginning of the week about raising awareness for your favourite non-profit. This kind of charity-supporting search engine is ano... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 1, 2007 Five Reasons Why It's Better to be Big & Popular than Small & Niche Mobile SEO Today we wrapped up our first ever SEOmoz training seminar - covering topics from keyword research to technical issues to search algorithms and social media. Despite the 7 straight hours of speaking on stage, I feel pretty good - the people in attendance appeared to have a terrific time and our after-hours party was still going strong when I left an hour ago. One of the most frequently ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 28, 2007 The Competition that Just Won't Budge Mobile SEO You know the feeling... That competitor who, no matter what you do, always ranks above your site. You've got more links, better links, better optimization, more targeted anchor text, tons of better viral content and yet, somehow, as though blessed by a higher power, your site simply can't outrank that @#$%! I'd like to do something a little different on the SEOmoz blog today, and ask yo... Read this post K By: Karen Browning-Cutler August 22, 2007 Do We Always Want to Find What Weâ€™re Looking For? Mobile SEO Do we always even know? The more I think about the “up and coming” engines, I have to wonder who will be the first genius to consolidate our human desire for getting what we want when we want it with our desire to poke around on the internet. Reading through random articles on Wikipedia is, of course, a very popular phenomena and the entire premise of Digg is built ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 14, 2007 Contribute Feedback for the MSN/Live Search Team (And Be Heard) Mobile SEO This coming Thursday, I've been invited to present to the Live Search team over in Redmond. We'll be discussing all sorts of issues, including spam on Live, increasing retention rates for searchers and growing relationships between Live and webmasters. However, I can't represent the entire search community on my own, so I'm hoping to solicit your input. What would you like to see Live do to mak... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 16, 2007 Sphinn - The Social News Site Every Search Marketer Should Be Using Mobile SEO Late last week, Danny Sullivan launched Sphinn, the search engine industry's own social news & networking site, with remarkably little fanfare. However, despite the relatively covert launch, the site itself has some fairly exceptional functionality and a very fast learning curve. And, if that wasn't enough, one of the top stories right now is on the lazin... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley May 16, 2007 Why, Hello There MSN Image Search! Mobile SEO As a writer/editor for Drivl, I do a lot of image searches in order to add relevant, amusing pictures to supplement stories that either I've written or that one of our users has submitted. At first, I would default to Google for all of my image searching needs, but the relevance is often low (and sometimes porn-tastic). Yahoo! Images is sometimes better, sometim...

In thinking about Google's future competitively and how they might eventually fall by the wayside, I always bring up the single example of a site I consistently use to find better content than what's available through Google's SERPs. Granted, this engine doesn't operate perfectly for e... Read this post D By: Dave Schappell April 27, 2007 Best Practices for URL Formatting (aka how does Amazon deal with multi-URLs for same pages?) Mobile SEO I have several questions about URL formatting. I'll start with some questions about Amazon, and then relate them to where I work every day. But, I think the questions, and their answers, are broadly relevant to those with URL formatting questions.1) How does Amazon get away with having multiple URLs for the same website pages? Don't bots penalize them ...

The comments on the blog showed quite clearly the backlash they faced from the population who visited.Well, it seems th...
