Read this post By: Jane Copland June 18, 2008 The Mobile Web - Vital For Social Networking; Important For Everyone Else Mobile SEO I've recently purchased my first BlackBerry phone, and I've thus been introduced to the joys of a truly mobile Internet. There is a big difference between composing all-lower-case, badly punctuated emails on one of these horrific pieces of rubbish and using a phone that was actually designed with the Internet in mind.

It looks fantastic but I've always been disappointed by a somewhat lacklustre performance, especially at startup. Certain that my super quick PC could do much much more, and inspired by the likes of Matt Cutts's numerous Ubuntu posts, I decided to take the plunge and install the Linux based OS. ... Read this post By: Jane Copland May 14, 2008 What Is Acceptable For \"People Search Engines?\" Mobile SEO I don't often get indignant about websites. Even bad ones. Sometimes I complain about what passes for Web 2.0 genius, but never before have I been really horrified by an online service. Spock.com horrifies me. I have never before felt like a website should cease to exist, but I am appalled at my experience with Spock. I'm in the process of having my personal information removed from the site at th...

Back in December I wrote an introduction to semantic search which, amongst getting me my first ever sphinn, seemed to open up a lot of questions in the comments.

Before you read this, I am neither an expert in online businesses nor in SEO world. I am still struggling m...

And I was really excited about seeing what all the hype was about [true knowledge]™! Ps: getting really excited to test out a search engine, must mean I'm in the right job... So what is [true knowledge]™?In simple terms,... Read this post By: Richard Baxter March 6, 2008 Where's All This Traffic Coming From?! Searchme! Mobile SEO One of our public sector recruitment sites has had a sudden, huge jump in direct referals according to Google analytics. That's normally a really, really good sign of some cracking offline marketing and brand awareness. Though my client is excellent at what they do, that spike in traffic has nothing to do with marketing..It's all be...
