  "content": "J By: Judith Lewis April 13, 2007 Ask.com does guerrilla marketing to take on a guerrilla in the search arena Mobile SEO I am often heartened by the strangest things â€“ a scone for brekkie, when the machine at work spits out moccaccino instead of cappuccino (when the service guy swaps milk powder for chocolate powder), someone giving me a crÃ¨me egg (despite the quality of the chocolate)â€¦. I was heartened to discover the culprit behind the ad campaign that sent me a free t-shirt (that will only fit me when I los... Read this post B By: bigalreturns March 23, 2007 YOUmoz: A Work Of Genius Mobile SEO I felt that it should be recognised exactly what a fantastic idea YOUmoz is, and how it should firmly cement SEOmoz as one of the premier SEO firms around today. Now I don’t want to come across as a suck up, and in a Web 2.0 world of user generated content, it’s not a unique idea, and while it will serve as a good forum for aspiring writers to present their ideas, this is no... Read this post By: Jane Copland March 5, 2007 Social Media Marketing Article Mobile SEO Last week, Rand discovered that an article we'd written quite some time ago had never been launched. \"How to Leverage Web 2.0 & Social Media Sites to Market Your Brand & Control Your Message\" covers thirty sites that you can use for marketing.

Mobile SEO In April 2006, Condé Nast launched Brides.com to serve as a portal site for its three wedding magazines Brides, Modern Bride, and Elegant Bride (yes, count them, three mags for something that hopefully only happens once for all of us). Rand was pleased about how well this site's launch was handled as he c... Read this post C By: Ciaran Norris February 13, 2007 Will Google Docs Really Kill Office? Mobile SEO I was doing a bit of work from home this weekend when I noticed Google's next move in it's ongoing battle to take over the world (or at least that part of it which resides on computers). Checking an email in my Gmail account from a colleague who had sent me a Word document I had a new choice about how I wished to view this document.... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 12, 2006 URL.com - Innovating Community Search Mobile SEO I ran into a kindred spirit at the SES conference in San Jose this summer - John Anderson. Smart, incredibly likable, motivated, and passionate about making the web a better place, I felt like I had known John for years after spending 10 minutes with him outside a session (this is one of my favorite parts of going to conferences). Over the past few months, John and a talented team of friends ha...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 14, 2006 Taking a Deeper Look at Ask.com Mobile SEO During our recent trip to San Jose, I was lucky enough to be the receipient of a dinner with the folks from Ask.com, including Gary Price, Robyn DeuPree, Paul Vallez, Erik Collier and two very nice gentlemen from the Ask public relations team. From the search industry side, I was accompanied by Jennifer La... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 14, 2006 Testing Out Yahoo!'s Site Builder Mobile SEO I thought it would be worth a shot to create a quick search industry tool with Yahoo!'s new site builder. I'd love your feedback on the results (as I'm sure Yahoo! would, too). ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 26, 2006 The Long Forgotten, Never Indexed Search API - XML.TEOMA.COM Mobile SEO I'm writing this entry in the hopes that the good people at Ask.com will continue to provide the service at xml.teoma.com without interruption. I have my fears that simply by talking about it, I risk destroying its value, but after a careful review, I believe it's worth the risk to share something of great value and interest to the SEM community as a whole.... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 13, 2006 MSNBowling in Canada Mobile SEO I know there's some friendly folks over in Redmond who like to read SEOmoz, so I'll make this as short and painless as possible. The MSN search engine currently uses link neighborhoods to judge if a .com site is targeted internationally (like, say - to Canada). So, if lots of links point at your .com site from .ca domains hosted in Ottawa, even if you want to be targeting the ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 20, 2006 Untapped Search Verticals Mobile SEO I figured that some creative Silicon Valley types could use a prod in the right direction about areas of search verticals that are still lacking major players (or high-quality players). Here's just a few that I think would be great to add to the search repertoire: Sports Search - Browse by year, team, sport, championship, stats, college, professional, etc. Th... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 12, 2006 Atlas Maps - An Impressive Alternative Mobile SEO Although it takes a little while to load, Fresh Logic Studios' Atlas map system is pretty amazing. The application allows for worldwide directions, zooms in with incredible detail and has a very spiffy interface. I did some basic testing to see how robust the system was, and I'd say that with the possible exception of ...
