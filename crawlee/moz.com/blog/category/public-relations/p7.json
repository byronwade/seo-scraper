  "content": "R By: Rob Chant July 10, 2009 Naivete & Misconceptions Still Prevalent Attitudes Towards SEO Public Relations I recently asked a question on a local Refresh mailing list, which mainly consists of developers, with a few designers, copy writers and other web professionals thrown in (but very few marketing and SEO people). I'd recently heard a developer refer to SEO as \"white noise\" and essentially a con, which struck me as... Read this post By: Jennifer Sable Lopez July 9, 2009 Favorite Twitter Conversation Ever - Search and The Princess Bride Public Relations Every now and then great conversations happen via Twitter -- by conversations I mean when multiple people Tweet and \"@\" each other regarding the same topic. During the day when so many people are online, there is a lot of \"noise\" which can make it pretty difficult to keep up. However, if you've ever had the joy of being a part of one of the #nightcrew search marketing Twitter conversations, then you know some of the gems I'm talking about. This is actually a great way to get to know other people from the community! Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 2, 2009 A Dozen Don'ts for SEOs Public Relations I'm not always a fan of Guy Kawasaki's work, but really enjoyed his post on the OPEN Forum - A Dozen Don'ts for Entrepreneurs. I thought I'd take a stab at replicating it with some of my biggest warnings for those in our field. For the list below, the word \"clients\" is interchangeable with \"marketing manager\" or \"executive team\" for in-house SEOs. ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 10, 2009 Google's Web Spam Team Deriving Value from Profiling SEO Operators of Interest Public Relations I read two blog posts this week that touch on a fascinating suject, and both are worthy of perusal: How Google Profiles SEOs from Wolf Howl Google Openly Profiles SEOs as Criminals from Outspoken Media ... Read this post By: Danny Dover June 9, 2009 Learn SEO in 30 Minutes a Day Public Relations Learning SEO can be a daunting experience. To make this process a little easier, I have broken down my method for learning SEO into bite-sized chunks that can be completed in 30 minutes or less. I have also tried to create a mechanism to make it easier to get help and expand personal networks. Read this post R By: rorycarlyle June 1, 2009 Can Rand Do No Wrong? Public Relations I've been watching this community now for a few months since I've joined, thumbing up what I think is good and thumbing down things that I don't. For the most part posts are well thought out, well written and well received. Admittedly, I've thumbed up way more than I've thumbed down - I like you guys :) I've also watched the opinions of different members and the amount of negative reviews they're willing to dish out, regardless of reputation or opinion towards other heavily participating members. Read this post S By: Sarah Carling May 20, 2009 GFGI Public Relations A note to all new and learning online marketers, I have been reading SEO & PPC resources, blogs and forums for much longer then I have been contributing to them. In fact, it is only in the last year, and more seriously in the last 6 months, that I have spent any real time in the online SEO communities. So I don't know how some who have been around for much longer have managed to stick around without killing someone. No wonder Darren sometimes comes across as cranky! Read this post K By: kenja May 14, 2009 Looking for Feedback from the SEM Community on Our Business Model Public Relations I was talking to Rand about this and he suggested I post this here for SEO community feedback. This is not a shameless plug, but a request for people to help us understand our value equation to SEM professionals. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin April 23, 2009 10 Tips for Getting (or Keeping) Your Next Search Marketing Job Public Relations As the economic climate worldwide has shown uncharacteristic elements of strife and turmoil, I've been getting more and more questions asked about finding and keeping a job in the Internet marketing space. As a CEO, and someone who employs quite a few folks, I think I can give some fairly detailed, albeit personal, advice on this topic. So - if you want to keep the job you've got, or ea... Read this post T By: Tyler Y April 17, 2009 Page Title Pandemonium with Amazon Public Relations Well, SEOmoz, I am going to come out of the shadows today. I have been lurking and learning without contributing for quite some time. While far from an expert, I know only enough to be dangerous. An issue arose when analyzing my companies feed to Google Shopping. We were sending two automotive related feeds to them, a part type feed and a year make model feed. Over the weekend Google decided it only wanted one feed and deactivated everyone’s account who was sending multiple feed types. Myself and my closest competitors lost our status until Wednesday, when our new feed was processed and posted. Read this post By: Rob Ousbey March 30, 2009 An SEM's Guide to Surviving Redundancy Public Relations I hope you read this post and enjoy it. I also hope you never need it. In the 'current economic climate' there is a chance that any company may have to 'restructure' or even cease trading altogether. These events are no fun for any employees involved, but I'd like to share some advice that will help you prepare for and cope with the worst situation if it arises. Read this post A By: amoore-71965 March 27, 2009 How SEO and The Moz Helped to Save My Life! Public Relations I've officially hit my 1 year anniversary as an official SEO! Writing a YOUmoz post (This is my 2nd one) to commemorate it was always in the back of my head. I would like to thank nicchenet for writing this anniversary post to ACTUALLY motivate me to write MY Thank You to SEOmoz.org. Read this post By: Pete Watson-Wailes March 13, 2009 Reputation Management 101: When Community Spirit Turns Bad Public Relations There was a post on YOUmoz recently about link building via article submissions. The author of it was taken to task, partly for submitting something that has debatable worth, but moreso for being self-promotional with it. [Note from Rebecca: This post was deleted upon the author's request; otherwise, I'd have linked to it.] As a result, I thought I'd write a short guide for anyone thinking of doing something big in a community, such as submitting a post to a blog, starting a thread on a forum, or some similar thing. Read this post O By: Oliver Bayes-Shelton March 11, 2009 2009 a Good Year for One Person Thanks to SEOmoz Public Relations Well before 2009 my head was awash with misleading information reading SEO. I was reading PDF after PDF about SEO techniques and just thought to myself, \"Will these PDFs actually come in handy and be useful?\" 2009 came and I can now say no, except for one. This set came from SEOmoz.org. After reading all the articles on this great website, I built my own website, and this is my story. Read this post",
