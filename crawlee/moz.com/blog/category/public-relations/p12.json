It's in Las Vegas, December 4-7, at the Las Vegas Convention Center. It sounds like it will be quite an event. Are you going to be there?

Public Relations If you’re expecting me to provide the answer to this, I’m very sorry but I can’t! It’s because I don’t have the answer I felt it would be a genuine topic for discussion. If only for my sake as choosing any reliable and talented partner in any industry is difficult enough but to find genuine partners in the SEO world, well according to web developer&rsqu... Read this post By: Rishi Lakhani October 8, 2007 Suggestions for SEOmoz (and Thanks for Listening ) Public Relations Of recent I have seen some interesting posts and activity on the blogs and Youmoz posts, which kind of geared me into writing this post. But before you go any deeper, remember I claim right to the disclaimer and it applies to the below – the ideas, suggestions are mine, and not reflection of anyone else or complaints – simply observatio... Read this post T By: Tom Critchlow October 4, 2007 11 (and a half) SEO Feeds to which All Beginners Should Subscribe Public Relations I'm going to let you in on a secret. SEOmoz is about change. Just in the past couple of weeks Matt has announced he's leaving (best of luck again!) and Rand has broken the news that SEOmoz is taking on external funding. As well as all that though, I can still remember when premium content launched and when Jane got hired. Jeez, I think I can even recall Rebecca getting hired.

Public Relations Is the A-list of bloggers a closed list?This is a question that has been bothering me for a while and that I'm blogging on Youmoz about because it needs the greatest audience possible - something that my non-A status can't provide. The A-list, as I define it, is that circle of experts and authorities that are most widely followed in any particular realm. In monetizing blogs, you ...

This move was covered extensively in the blogosphere and even influenced other giants in the online publishi... Read this post C By: Carlos del Rio September 13, 2007 How Are SEOs Like Jellyfish? Public Relations I need a humor break. I responded to buybigtires post about passion in writing by suggesting that connecting disparate concepts helps squeeze some creative juice. In response to my proposal of the title \"How Are SEOs Like Jellyfish?\" he responded like this:Because we have no spine....are constantly kept in the dark.... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 26, 2007 I Used to Respect Robert Scoble's Opinion... Public Relations Like many fans of the web, I've been a great admirer of Robert Scoble, noted technology blogger and former Microsoftee, since I first saw his work (probably around 2004). However, after watching this bizarre video on how Mahalo, Facebook & Techmeme are going to beat Google in search, I think I'll have a tough time respecting his opinions on future topics. Let me get this straight fo... Read this post L By: lauramaccallow@yahoo.co.uk August 20, 2007 What REALLY Makes a Top SEO: The Ultimate Abbreviated Top 10 Wishlist Public Relations 1. Tech… You understand everything, absolutely everything that is posted on Google Webmaster Central Blog and Digital Point Design & Development Forums and more, you know that flash is not entirely a bad, and that AJAX and JavaScript can be effectively coded in.

Read this post C By: Carlos del Rio August 2, 2007 10 Questions Your Customers Need You to Know Public Relations Rand wrote an interesting post about 10 questions you should ask to determine your value as an SEO. It's a good read, especially the comments. It's no secret that I've been frequently dissapointed by the level of knowledge of many SEO companies, even those who have a big prese... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 1, 2007 Answers to Ten SEO Questions & Some New Questions from Danny Sullivan Public Relations It looks like our ten questions post was a hit. To follow up, our own, intrepid point man, Scott Willoughby, will be crafting an advanced test/quiz on many different SEO topics - some fun, some serious - and should have it launched in the next 3-4 weeks. Await with bated breath (I know I am) And now, the answers to last night's SEO questions: What four search engines ... Read this post C By: Ciaran Norris July 23, 2007 Head Sphinning? This Should Help: All The Sphinn Tools Public Relations If you haven't heard of Sphinn by now there is a good chance that you've spent the last couple of weeks in a black hole. But whilst the new site is generating a lot of buzz, it could be said that it's also been getting a bit confusing. Why? Because every man and his dog have released Sphinn widgets, or feed flares, or something. So I've collected all the ones that I could... Read this post C By: Ciaran Norris July 23, 2007 Why Rand Is Wrong, And Sphinn Is A Popularity Contest Public Relations I’m on holiday at the moment (although my wife might argue with that, considering that I have written this blog post) and so I’ve had a lot of time to consider the conversation going on at, and about, Sphinn right now, and especially Rand’s opinion on it.In a post entitled “Sphinn.com is basically just a popularity contest” T...
