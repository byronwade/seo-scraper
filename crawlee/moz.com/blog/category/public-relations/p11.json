Public Relations I'm sure that many of you will have seen the flurry of posts announcing the winners of Search Engine Journal's Search Industry Award (SEOmoz got an honourable mention in the Best SEO Blog category, which it won last year).Whilst this is obviously great news for all those named, ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 9, 2008 Problems with Web Survey Design & An Example from the SEJournal Blog Awards Public Relations I love SearchEngineJournal's Annual Awards. I think it's terrific that even a small community like search marketing can have its own mini-version of the Oscars each year :) It's fun, it builds friendly competition and it inspires those of us who compete to work harder and earn our keep. Howev... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 2, 2008 New Year's Resolutions for Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Public Relations It's common for people to enter a new year with a resolution, but this year, I thought I'd try something entirely new (and probably overflowing with hubris) and assign New Year's resolutions to the big players in the search market. Thus, without further ado... Google should resolve to: Build more search demand with the money they've amassed. At 70-75% of market share,...

Its every SEOmozer for himself. 1 2 3 4 Let's have a thumbwar!Yep that’s right. Rumour has it (and yes its only a couple of us spreading the rumour) that the thumbs league in SEOmoz is about to see a flurry of... Read this post By: Gabriel Goldenberg December 14, 2007 The Z-List Newsletter Public Relations The Attention Deficit Problem (That Isn't a Disorder)Michael Gray wrote recently that producing great content without pushing it to the community is like having Will Shakespeare writing alone in a closet. It's sad, but true: in blogging, it's not what you know, but who you know that makes a difference. In order to get that prized link from a major-league blog... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 11, 2007 The Secret \"10%\" of SEO Knowledge and How Information Spreads in the Search World Public Relations A conversation last week got me thinking about how knowledge spreads in the world of SEO. I noted on a panel that 90% of all SEO knowledge is \"out there,\" floating on the web, mentioned in presentations, and generally findable by anyone who knows enough to ask the right questions or perform the right searches. The other 10% is behind the curtain - it's hidden knowledge that rarely eve... Read this post S By: sarita-55215 December 9, 2007 Lazy Searchers Public Relations Are we creating lazy searchers? The thought came up while reading a blog mentioning that RSS technology has resulted in readers waiting for blogs to come to them. Are searchers beginning to wait for the search to come to them? Google (toolbar), and recently Yahoo, will finish a search phrase for you. SEOrs and PPCrs think we know what words you want to use to find a site. Sea... Read this post By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers November 30, 2007 Top 10 Tips to Top 10 Mozzery Public Relations Next week's PubCon marks one year since I first discovered SEOmoz, and my meteoric rise to fame has wowed both fans and critics alike (or at least that's what the voices in my head tell me). Having finally broken into the coveted Top 10, I thought I'd give back to the community and share the secrets of my success before I'm cornered by Rand in Vegas and forced to take the Top 10 lo...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 14, 2007 Stoney DeGeyter of Pole Position Marketing on Viral Campaigns, Sphinn, Blackmail and More Public Relations I think this is one of the most enjoyable interviews we've featured here. Stoney DeGeyter is an SEO and Internet marketer from Reno, NV and the owner of Pole Position Marketing, an SEO/M firm with considerable talent and a roster of happy clients. In the interview, Stoney covers his view on the SEO issues of the day, along with a terrific stor... Read this post By: Brian Brown November 12, 2007 How Do You Role Your SEO? Public Relations Along with all the hot \"technical\" topics this year, like Universal Search and blended search in general, algo changes, social media, local and mobile search, and most recently Google's big crack down on paid text links, it also seems to have been a big year for background discussions... high on the list of topics over the last 12 months or so being employment. On one hand you h... Read this post K By: Kat French November 8, 2007 Bill Shakespeare: Butt-Kicking Online Marketer? Public Relations I've made a few offhand comments here on others' posts about my theory that English majors make good search marketers.

Public Relations The other day I mentioned I needed an attorney for a business matter. My mom asked why I didn't just call my cousin the attorney. I explained to my mom that while my cousin is an attorney, she was a medical malpractice attorney and probably knew very little about real estate transactions.The whole thing got me thinking about Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and where the fut...
