Read this post By: Casey Henry December 11, 2008 Help Future Search Marketers! Public Relations I often get dragged away from the computer by my girlfriend to head to the bookstore. My favorite section is the “Web Design” section, obviously. I like to take a look at the SEO books and see what kind of outdated information books are pushing onto the readers. This trip was a little different because I ran into a college student who was looking at an SEO book. We began talking about SEO and more about the class he was researching SEO for. I gave him my contact information and told him to contact me if he needed any further information on the topic.

Public Relations Being that I am mostly on the business development/sales side of things, I hear a lot of the concerns, questions, thoughts, etc from our clients. One of the things that has come up more and more is, \"Do we really need to have ongoing SEO maintenance?\", or \"Can we wait on doing the ongoing SEO?\" It sounds like it should be an automatic \"You need it\" (being that this is the business I'm in and my business partner and I would love the work), but is it always been that easy?
