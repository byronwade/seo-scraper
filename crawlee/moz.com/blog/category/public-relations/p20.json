Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 20, 2005 Bad Information from SEO-News Public Relations Following Nick's lovely recommendations for community building, I'll be doing a bit of link baiting in this thread.

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 3, 2005 Threadwatch is 1 year old Public Relations It's hard to believe that Threadwatch is only a year old (today). In that time, Nick has taken the site from obscurity to infamy. They've been Slashdotted, added to major blogrolls all around the search and technology industries and created a hotbed for SEO/M and search politics. Congratulations, Nick. I hope SEOmoz can do half as well in a yea... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 29, 2005 Anatomy of a Forum Thread Public Relations Kim Krause Berg posted a hilarious topic over at Cre8asite on the subject of a forum thread on light bulb changing.

Public Relations Search Engine Optimization has been described as an art, a science, a practice, an abomination and a career by those in and around the industry. But, to most outsiders learning about the practice for the first time, SEO is primarily seen as a service that professionals provide to clients. Although I'm often in the professional seat, I have become a client of many well known SEOs and secondary p...

It's by no means over-arching, but it's an excellent place to start and it's free. She also has a good, basic description of the specific tasks that fit into SEO work: ...

Public Relations The lazy days of summer crawl in North America & Europe, creating a bevvy of webmasters who fret and furrow their brows, wondering where the traffic has gone.

There's quite a bit of good advice about contracts in general and SEO specifically in this thread, but mostly what we're seeing here is the forums serving as a business refuge and tool. There's several individuals in the thread who are p...
