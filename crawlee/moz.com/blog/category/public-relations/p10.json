Read this post A By: Adrienne Embery-Good February 24, 2008 Reflections on the Industry: the Hot Tub, the Economy, and SEO Public Relations I was at my neighborhood hot tub last night enjoying a glass of wine and conversation with my husband when a stranger appeared.

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 17, 2008 Why the Vast Majority of SEOs No Longer Target Individual Search Engines Public Relations A long time ago (at least, in web years), search engine optimization required specific targeting practices for each of the engines. For Hotbot, you'd need to place two repetitions of every keyword side-by-side in your meta keywords tag, while for Northern Light, a picture of at least one dancing baby in the bottom right-hand corner made all the difference ...

He's cited by some of the most reputable SEO minds in the industry. He has likely influenced hundreds if not thousands of enterprising webmasters. Who is this veritable titan of SEO that I speak of? Why Tedster of course. I know, I know. Many of you are probably asking yourselves, \"Who the heck is Ted...

Besides that, I've also got some cool things to share with you about your fellow members here.

Read this post By: Gabriel Goldenberg January 14, 2008 How Can SEs and SEOs Work Together to Improve Understanding and Fight Spam? Public Relations A lead came to me with a site that was using hidden keywords in the same colour as its background. He also stuffed other pages on his website full of keywords in the serious hope that this would enable him to rank for each of those keywords (i.e. a few hundred keywords per page).
