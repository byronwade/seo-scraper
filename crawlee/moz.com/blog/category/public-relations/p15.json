Although the duties we perform on a daily basis are fun and challenging they can often lead to stress, burn outs, tiredness and feelings of being overworked or overloaded. Tak... Read this post By: KoMarketing Associates March 3, 2007 My Fantasy Baseball Addiction Parallels Why I Love SEO Public Relations Two years ago a friend introduced me to fantasy baseball (rotisserie style of course), and needless to say, I've been hooked ever since. As I logged in last night to check my auto-drafted selections (and my wife exasperatingly asks why I am on the computer for the 14th hour in a row), I started to think about what makes this game so much fun to me and it occurred to me that 'Yes... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 1, 2007 What Makes SEO & SEM So Damn Hard Public Relations The business of optimizing websites for search engines is an immensely difficult, convoluted task. It requires a massive amount of knowledge, an incredible dedication to keeping up with one of the fastest moving industries on the planet and ruthless... Read this post M By: Matt Aaron February 20, 2007 Local Search - a budding service for SEO firms to offer Public Relations Local Search Optimization has a chance to become its own niche market (if it hasn't already). I found one SEO firm running AdWords for \"Local Search Optimization\" - I expect there to be much greater competition at the end of the year for this term. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin February 20, 2007 What Separates Search Marketing Novices from Experts Public Relations Our field has grown tremendously over the last 5 years. When Danny Sullivan launched the first Search Engine Strategies conference, I'd estimate that less than 5,000 people worldwide called themselves SEOs. Today, the number of self-referencing \"search marketers\" is probably closer to 100,000 and may well be much higher. But, a number of features separate the SEO/M expert fr... Read this post By: Brian Brown February 15, 2007 SEO - Well If It Isn’t Rocket Science? Public Relations The debate continues to wage within the SEM family as to whether SEO is rocket science. Somewhere along the way, it seems that this has become a question of literals? This is certainly a great position to be in if you are on the opposing side of the debate since it takes away the relative meaning of the statement and simply leaves a true or false statement. So if we are stuck in this li... Read this post S By: stevenp February 8, 2007 How do you describe what an SEO does? Public Relations One of the more interesting challenges that I find as a search engine optimizer is succinctly describing what I do when people who are not savvy in the fields of web design or e-commerce ask me about my job. How do you sum up this job in a quick, interesting way? Read this post I By: IBrian January 16, 2007 SEO isn’t hacking - and data security tips Public Relations The recent hacking of SEO blogs such as Wolf Howl, BoogyBonBon and Stuntdubl underlined a key point – the vulnerabilities of publishing software that we rely on.However, in this incident, although the... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin January 8, 2007 My Take on the Top Ten SEO Leaders Public Relations Didier Bizimungu had a post on his SEO News Blog that circulated around the industry. The subject was the top 10 SEO leaders, and since Didier asked for my opinion, I thought I'd share it publicly. Here's Didier's list: Daron Babin Matt Cutts R... Read this post I By: IBrian January 6, 2007 The New On Site Optimisation Public Relations Recently there have been a few negative comments about general on-page optimisation. David Pasternack has pooh-poohed it, and Shoemoney has expressed reservations. A couple of years ago I would have joined them – after... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 14, 2006 How Does that Page at Bruce Clay Rank So Well? Public Relations Someone mentioned to me today that Bruce Clay has done a great job of optimizing his site over the past year, and reclaimed some of those top positions for broad level SEO terms. One of these is search engine optimization, where Bruce ranks in the 2nd spot: ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 12, 2006 Trouble Between Drinkbait & Hatbait and the IP Issues Involved Public Relations An ugly situation recently arose out of Chris Hooley's \"drinkbait\" campaign at Pubcon (which was not only a great idea, but a well-executed one, to boot). Liana Evans developed a remarkably similar campaign called \"hatbait\" that she began at SES Chicago. Until tonight, when I read Chris' post on the subject... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 28, 2006 Are We Doling Out Bad Advice? Public Relations Aaron had a brilliant post yesterday on on Bad Advice that Sounds Good. He noted a few \"white lies\" of the SEO world that we continue to perpetuate. I agree with some of them wholeheartedly: Create quality content. Why do I hate it? If you don't hav... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 21, 2006 Cliches in the SEO World Public Relations Alright, this one's just for fun. We were batting around some cliches in the industry (at conferences, on blog posts, in forums) and thought that a few were worth sharing. Black Hats are BritishMore specifically, it seems they all have some relationship to Leeds (born there, live there, from \"around there\"). Maybe there's something in the wate... Read this post",
