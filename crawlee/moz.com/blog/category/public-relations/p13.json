Tonight I came across a few examples of this that drove the point home. #1 - Horrifying Advertising that's Nightmarishly Effective ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 13, 2007 The New Direction of SES & An Interview with Kevin Ryan Public Relations Last week, I received some very friendly correspondence from the Search Engine Strategies and Incisive Media organizations about my irresponsible post on speaker exclusivity. I knew that I had done wrong, and to make amends, I asked if Kevin Ryan, who was ... Read this post L By: Lori Bourne June 12, 2007 Confessions of an SEO Neophtye Public Relations About a year ago, I opened a webstore where I could sell my educational products. After a few years of selling on eBay, I was longing to break free of the high listing fees. I had no knowledge of SEO (I had never even heard the term) and my store reflected it. Pages had no titles, no headers, and no quality content. I didn’t have many links and didn’t know how to go about getting ... Read this post A By: Anonymous June 6, 2007 I Work For Snake Oil Salesmen Public Relations Sigh... maybe I'm just looking to vent, and perhaps a few comments saying, \"It's OK, your freelance service will take off,\" or maybe I'm just fed up with this altogether. I work for a \"snake oil SEO Company\" (one of the largest in America, actually). I'm their one and only \"SEO Specialist.\" I use quotes because nobody above me can spell SEO, ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 4, 2007 Leaking Rumors... SES, SMX & Speaker Exclusivity Public Relations Usually, I don't like to post unsubstantiated rumors because the potential for trouble is high and it's often not worthwhile. However, this time I'm posting with the express goal of stopping the situation from becoming a reality (or at least requesting a re-think). Here's the deal... Today at the SMX conference, two sources that I trust told me independently that last week, the folk... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 30, 2007 The Vast Ocean Between Shoemoney & SEOmoz and Why You Should Be Able To Trust Blog Links Public Relations I don't think many would argue that Jeremy Schoemaker and I have very different styles of blogging and doing business. In person, Jeremy's always been a great friend and someone I really respect, but on his blog, things are different. I sometimes feel a great disconnect between the way he approaches topics and the way I'd wish to see them presented. Case in point - his post,... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 29, 2007 Search Engine Optimization Article at Wikipedia Doesn't Deserve Attention Public Relations I received an email from Carsten Cumbrowski while jetsetting in China: Jonathan Hochman (aka Jehochman) was spending a lot of time on cleaning up the article about SEO at Wikipedia. It is now in the review for becoming a featured article candidate. ... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley May 23, 2007 SEO Meetups, Now (Hopefully) Coming to a City Near You! Public Relations Jon Payne (if I were talking to his friend and wanted to invite them both to a party, I'd so say \"You better bring the Payne!\") emailed Rand, urging him to write a blog post about SEO groups. Since Rand's indisposed in China, poor Jon had to resort to downgrading and asking me if I would blog about it. My motto should be \"Rebecca Kelley: When R... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 20, 2007 If You Could Ask the Search Engines Any Question and Get An Honest, Complete Answer... What Would it Be? Public Relations Years ago, the world of SEO was filled with mystery and intrigue - vague half-answers from the engines combined with private forum and backroom conspiracies to make for an industry rife with misinformation. Today, those problems still exist in some forms, but the engines are far more forthright and the mysteries of the ranking algorithms are no longer shrouded in dubious half-truths. Sure, we m...

Last week, I received an email from him asking if we could mention one of the most fantastic resources available for helping in the fight against the disease - World Commun... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 7, 2007 Epiar is Making Exceptional Strides in the Automation & Efficiency of SEO Campaigns Public Relations Two weeks ago, I spent 90 minutes on the phone (a lifetime for me) with Epiar's Ken Jurina and Curtis Dueck (they're in a video with WebProNews here). They walked me through their propietary and incredibly advanced, internal SEO software, explaining how they're able to provide&... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley May 4, 2007 The Age Old Question: If You Inherited SEOmoz, What Would You Do With It? Public Relations A couple weeks ago, just for the hell of it, I emailed several SEOs and asked them the question they've waited their entire careers to hear: If you inherited SEOmoz, what would you do with it? Rand Fishkin is out of the picture (he left SEO to pursue his dream of becoming a master chef, he eloped with Mystery Guest, he got sued by Puma, whatever), leaving you to run SEOmoz and ... Read this post J By: JohnBarton May 3, 2007 I have a headache. Public Relations Why? Because SEO is a never ending quagmire. For the last six month I have immersed myself in what Search Engine Optimization means and am left with the realization that getting to the top of the SERPS for any commerical and competitive term is hard work (no suprise there), harder than I thought. And is an ever moving target.The concepts are pretty much the same across the board. G... Read this post",
