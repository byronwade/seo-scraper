SEO Analytics If you use Google Analytics then this bug hyper inflates all your metrics and causes you to make sub optimal marketing decisions. I was recently checking my bounce rates like every analyst does now days and was shocked when I saw my home page with an 83.95% bounce rate.

Read this post M By: Martijn Verstrepen January 19, 2012 Google Analytics Cross Domain Tracking Made Easy SEO Analytics A default Google Analytics implementation will break your visits when tracking cross domain websites (such as webshops using an external payment gateway) because the first-party cookies can only be read from the domain that set the cookies.
