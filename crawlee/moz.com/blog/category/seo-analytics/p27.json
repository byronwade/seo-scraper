SEO Analytics I've just been shopping around for a Heat Map tracking software and stumbled upon those two, which looks good to me: CrazyEgg (I think Rand already talked about it), which is simple, easy to use and cost between 0,33$ - 0,80$ / 1 000 visits.

SEO Analytics Sorry for my non-existance lately, I'm back for good now! I've been playing around with this tool - Web CEO Pro, for a while and I've seen Rand mention he was a little bit tired of it because it was expensive, but I'd like to say that for a couple hundred dollars a year (if you don't get into their monthly fees), it can do a pretty goo... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 16, 2006 The Ultimate Analytics Comparison Project Needs Your Help SEO Analytics Last week I wrote a piece offering a free linkbait idea on web analytics.

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 30, 2006 When an Action Comes Around, You Must Track It SEO Analytics I should be eternally castigated to the fiery furnace for spoofing a Devo tune, but hopefully redemption can come in the form of this post's value. We've been spending some time in analytics programs lately, both for our own in-house projects and for some clients. In every instance, the addition of action tracking makes a huge difference to how well we can optimize and make changes to internal ...

SEO Analytics Some folks have been asking for my opinions of Hitwise & Alexa data recently, and I figured the best I could do would be to illustrate the sampling problems of both with some real life data. First off, let's look at SEOmoz's traffic levels over the last few months. This comes courtesy of our Indextools stats program + Feedburner data for RSS. You can see more on our ... Read this post G By: GeoffreyF67 September 6, 2006 Variation on Type-In Traffic SEO Analytics I recently had the opportunity to renew 1000 of my spam domains.Since the domains only cost me 99 cents each when I bought them and renewal was nearly $6 at the time, I decided it wasn't worth it.In fact, my evil plan was that I was going to simply let these sites expire and then buy them back once they expired and went into the domain pool...Imagine my surprise... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 31, 2006 Action Tracking by Referral Source & the Linkbait Bump SEO Analytics I'm an analytics junkie. Along with my constant monitoring of email and the blog tracker, I have to admit that I watch referring URLs, unique visitors and Feedburner stats like a hawk.
