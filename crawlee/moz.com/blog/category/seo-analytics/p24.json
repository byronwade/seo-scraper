Read this post F By: FreshEgg March 30, 2009 Integrated Telephone Call Tracking with CallTrackID for the UK SEO Analytics Being avid followers of SEOmoz and the YOUmoz blog, we here at Fresh Egg got very excited when we read that “Web Analytics Now Expands to Include Offline Phone Call Tracking” as far back as September last year. That post involving Mongoose Metrics got our pulses racing because it seemed to be an answer to one of our most persistent frustrations. As an SEO provider using analytics packages, we know our clients are getting sales calls. The frustrating reality has been that we can’t prove that those calls are due to the PPC or organic SEO work we are doing for them. Mongoose had cracked the problem – but the service isn’t available in the UK.

Read this post S By: Stephen Tallamy February 25, 2009 Google Analytics JavaScript is Broken SEO Analytics I really like Google Analytics - the interface is easy to use, the information easy to interpret and it's free. You can do great tricks with filters to slice the data in different ways. I do wish that less of the reports used sample data and it'd be nice if you could label points in your data to cross-reference with your SEO activities. But the one thing that really bugs me about Google Analytics is that the JavaScript you tag your site with is broken.

Read this post D By: Dan Crean December 19, 2008 Moneyball and the Search Marketer SEO Analytics In his book “Moneyball,” Michael Lewis explains the working of Billy Beane, general manager of the Oakland As and his role as an asset manager. Unlike the NFL, in which teams share television revenue and stick to overall salary caps, major league baseball allows teams to fend for themselves. As a result the big market teams (e.g., the New York Yankees) have more money to acquire top players and assemble a winning team. Managers of teams with smaller budgets, like Beane, have to be smarter in selecting lower paid players. Lewis admires Beane’s use of hard numbers in evaluating players and identifying underpaid ones. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 24, 2008 Benchmarking Your Website: Metrics to Review Before an SEO Engagement Begins SEO Analytics Many SEO projects begin with a site review or audit, identifying potential weaknesses and opportunities. However, a great number of these analyses leave out a healthy dose of collecting metrics - a critical factor in helping to benchmark future progress and see how far you've come (and what effect your SEO changes have had). Thus, I figured it would be valuable to review, in full, the pre-... Read this post By: Brendan Fullam November 12, 2008 Lots of Page Views - Good or Bad? SEO Analytics **Please note I have no affiliation with Inc Magazine or their website. I read the article while waiting to get a haircut at my local barber. I recently read an article in Inc Magazine titled \"Improving Your Sense of Site,\" which focused on ways in which your analytics can show you how to increase sales. It was a great article and worth the read (gave me some great ideas), but one thing stuck out and I thought was worth discussing.

One of the best sessions I attended at SMX Advanced back in the summer was the advanced analytics panel. It covered some fantastic tips on advanced methodologies and metrics for search analytics. It was the inspiration for this post, which is going to cover some slightly different areas. Although we primarily deal with SEO and search advertising, we do a little online display advertising and have recently found ourselves thinking about measurement metrics for PR and offline advertising: Read this post E By: Eric Bryant September 22, 2008 \"Define:\" - A Solid Natural Traffic Generation Strategy SEO Analytics As I've been watching my traffic stats lately, I've noticed something quite interesting.
