I spent a long time working on ranking well in Google, and I've found a new problem that may not even apply to most people. Once you rank number 1 for a extended period of time, you become a trusted source for that keyword. Now I'm s... Read this post By: Eric Enge April 15, 2008 Google's Ajax APIs Search Engines At Stone Temple Consulting, we've spent some time playing with the Google Ajax Search API and the Google Ajax Feed API. These are great tools for embedding dynamic content in your web site. This post is going to talk about how to use these two APIs to do just that. Read this post By: jamersan April 11, 2008 Yahoo Is Making Things Interesting Search Engines For years as a website designer, I struggled building sites that both fit in Internet Explorer and Netscape. The entire time, I didn't care who won the browser war I just wanted someone to win NOW and the other to go away. The increased work, stress, and money spent to build the same thing twice was frustrating and in my opinion unnecessary. The search engine wars a...

Here's a conversation I've just had with a Google AdWords support person. It reflects how ridiculous the historical account factor can be in determining quality score. (But then again, Paul showed that the exact same campaign on two different accounts would be rated differently, in terms of... Read this post By: Svetoslav Stefanov April 5, 2008 Locally Registered and Hosted Sites, and How Links from Abroad Affect Them Search Engines Recently I got my hands on an 8 years old domain, with no backlinks at all. The site is very small, about 20 pages with no significant content and it is pure HTML. The perfect little site for experimenting. I has all the weight of an old domain and no bad history, or even a slight attempt for search engine results manipulation. The current experiment I something i read about a while ago... Read this post K By: Kamanashish Roy April 3, 2008 SEO By Google Search Engines The story ends here. We should better say the story has ended much before it even actually started. Google (Tom Phillips) has announced to sell off ... Read this post S By: SeanMaguire March 24, 2008 The True Origin Of Google Search Engines The year was 1999. Dissatisfied with the difficulty of finding topic relevant information on “the Internet” that he had personally invented only two years earlier, technology industry visionary Al Gore Jr., invents a means of significantly improving the search process with the creation of the world’s first “Search Engine”, based on a complex mathematical fo... Read this post B By: Brent Payne March 20, 2008 What's Good for the WMC HTML Verification File Isn't Good for the Meta Tag Search Engines Most of you are probably aware that you can utilize the same HTML file to verify Google Webmaster Central access for several different domains and subdomains. Google makes that very easy to implement. Simply keep the HTML file handy and load it up in whatever folder you need to verify. I've been doing this for over a year now with Google HTML verification files. Why ...

We were all given the same keyword to try to rank for and at the end of 60 days, whoever is in first position in the organic SERPs in Google is the winner. Only stipulations were that we had to buy a new domain, couldn't use an existing one, and we couldn't put any form of the k... Read this post By: Michael Tighe March 14, 2008 Page Title Optimization and Google's New Inline Search Box Search Engines I read a great article about the Google Inline Search boxes today over at Get Elastic and was immediately inspired about how we structure our page titles can really effect our users perceptions and ease in finding information; especially using new services like googles new search box. Take a look at the following image of the insite search in action: ... Read this post By: Brendan Fullam March 13, 2008 Did You Mean? - No, I Didn't Search Engines I'm sure we have all seen it, or have had it happen to us. You are doing a search on Google and you get a results page that says \"Did you mean, ####\" at the top of the page. I firmly believe that this is a helpful tool to many people who are either horrible spellers, or had a momentary \"brain-fart\"! But what do you do when this affects your own search engine traffic?... Read this post By: Pete Watson-Wailes March 12, 2008 Is Google Making Site Search Redundant? Search Engines So here's an interesting thought... You're Google. You have every page on everyone's site in the world (or near as makes no odds) indexed. What more can you do with that information?Well, how about providing a search function for that person's site. Looks like that's what the big G is thinking at the moment at any rate. Have a look at the following examples, and see w...
