Search Engines If you are an SEO and are not aware of Google’s latest PageRank Leg Drop, it may be time to hang up your keyboard. Around the webmaster community, site after site was devalued, with many webmasters responding with “well our rankings didn’t drop, so what does it matter?” Well...

Today I came into work and straight away started to run all my usual reports, went to make a cup of tea and when i came back to my desk i almost fell off my chair. We dropped 20 places! We had dropped position on our second highest keyword by 20 places (on Google.com.au for Australian sites... Read this post By: Dr. Peter J. Meyers October 30, 2007 Hey Google, I'm Over Here! (a 301 Experiment) Search Engines Recently, I made the difficult decision to change the domain name of my blog and consulting website. It had to be done; the old name just didn't make sense anymore, no one could spell it, and it was terrible for SEO. Of course, I knew all of the rules of successful 301 redirection, in theory, but when it came to putting theory into practice, I found myself dreading pulling the switch....

And I can't be the only one sitting here thinking that Google is on the same type of ob... Read this post By: Lily Grozeva October 9, 2007 200,000 Affiliate Websites Lose Rankings Overnight Search Engines I am unsure if this is the right place for this post, however this is the place I have spent many hours for the last year or so, and I am so concerned right now that I cannot think of a better place. So here is the story. I have been participating in the Zlio affiliating program since Apr 2007, and until recently, especially in terms of SEO, it was a dream. With a week, my old website of 300 pages was ranking ahead of Ebay, Nextag, Shopping.com etc for many competitive keywords. I was very happy with the results and they were in place for over six months. Although I spent many hours working on my shops and acquired some quality link exchanges, I noticed that other Zlio affiliates were also performing extremely well.

But a recent Shoemoney post made me want to bring up a combined issue. And while each could have been its own post, I decided to combine it. SEOMoz points be damned.Myopic SEOs and Search Engines If you as... Read this post L By: lauramaccallow@yahoo.co.uk October 5, 2007 New Yahoo! Search - Relevant, But is it Based on Volume As Well? Search Engines This is interesting. Go to www.yahoo.com and type in Barry Bonds (e.g.)See the drop down list? Nice.. but apart from assumed relevancy application to these suggestions, are they also based on actual search volume and listed in order based on volume? I would assume so.This appears to be Yahoo!s answer to Google Suggest Search, but it doesn't... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 3, 2007 Yahoo! Leveraging \"Content\" for Queries Search Engines If you've been on the Yahoo! home page in the last few days, you've seen this phenomenon: The red box around the Indiana Jones 4 link should, by all rights, take the user to a Yahoo! Movies page about the upcoming film - after all, Yahoo! has had links like these for ye... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley October 1, 2007 Google Dominating Hollywood as Well as the Search Demographic Search Engines The other night I was watching Knocked Up, and in the movie there are a few references to \"Googling\" something. For example, in one scene the older daughter is riding in a car and casually says \"I Googled murder,\" while in another scene Leslie Mann's character asks Paul Rudd to \"Google\" their daughter's symptoms to determine whether she has the chicken pox or a rash. I also recently saw The Bourne Ultimatum, and in one scene Jason Bourne uses Google to search for an agent's name, and later on there is a car chase where the guys in one car are using Google Maps o...

Meyers September 27, 2007 Weird #1 Rankings & Other SEO Games Search Engines Every once in a while, someone on SEOmoz comments about ranking #1 on Google for a search term like \"sexiest man in SEO\". Some of this is deliberate, either just in good fun or an exercise in SEO prowess, but frequently we also rank #1 for terms we never intended to, just by building search-friendly sites.So, just for fun, let me put a question out there to all of you Mozzers: ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 26, 2007 My Personal Opinion - 90% of the Rankings Equation Lies in These 4 Factors Search Engines I think that sometimes we in the field of search marketing try to make the practice more difficult than it really is. True - there are hundreds of ways to build a link, an infinite number of keywords, thousands of unique sources to drive traffic along with analytics, design, usability, code structure, conversion testing, etc. However, when it comes to the very specific question of how to rank w... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 21, 2007 Bizarre Factors Search Engines Might Use to Rank the Results Search Engines I admit it - I struggle to understand patent applications (one of the big reasons that Si is part of our staff). However, Bill Slawski doesn't and it's made our collective lives in the SEO world (and the mozplex) considerably easier. Take, for example his two incredibly fascinating posts collecting patent applications and speculating on how the engines m...
