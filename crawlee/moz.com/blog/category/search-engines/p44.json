Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 3, 2007 Remarkable Openness from Google's Black Box Thanks to Saul Hansel Search Engines I'm more than a little skeptical of mainstream media articles about the search engines.

Search Engines DMeurope has a very interesting article describing how Google might look like in the near future. Google calls its vision - Universal Search. And no, it doesn't mean they are going to index all those weird martian porn sites. Frankly, that would be impossible, even for Google.The US in bi...

Search Engines There has been a lot of debate recently in \"SEO News Land\" (aka all the SEO blogs I subscribe to) about various testing Google has been doing. Particularly with how they treat the display of their paid ads.This morning I noticed something I hadn't seen before and no-one else in the office could re-create (on a side note - is it just co-incidence that they picked the one SEO...
