  "content": "G By: GeoffreyF67 August 24, 2006 Terms of Service - Are they enforceable? Search Engines Matt Cutts brought up an interesting point about the Google Terms of Service. Basically that scraping them is against their Terms of Service. Most websites these days have some type of TOS but I've never heard of one actually being enforced. I know that if you're being a good guy and a... Read this post E By: Ella_D August 24, 2006 Open call for French SERPs that need explaining Search Engines Rand got me all excited with his post. I've been tracking down the French vertical of \"web design / website design\" theme of keywords for the last 12 months. This vertical is very similar to the English one. As an example, if you wanted to score well for Web Design in English on Google.com, you would try to hit, in the long term, the best keywords, like:...

Because AOL uses Google for their search.I recently grabbed a copy of the AOL search data that was released earlier this month. The dataset is rather large - 450MB compressed - over 1.4GB uncompressed in MySQL.This...

This one was posted on Matt's blog on August 8th (and there's a shout out to yours truly!). It exclusively has to do with the launch of Google Webmaster Central, which Rand covered in a ... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley August 16, 2006 Matt Cutts and I are BFF Search Engines Hey everyone, Rebecca here. I'm back from San Jose (and San Diego for a brief R&R), and I have GREAT news. Apparently my toiling over transcribing Matt Cutts' videos has paid off big time, because he and I are totally BFF (best friends forever). Seriously, check this out: ...

I felt so bad for her, I just had to post this timely review of Google's new Webmaster Central, which is replacing sitemaps (and including its old functionality). There's a lot of material to cover, so let's ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin August 3, 2006 New Real Estate SERPs Refinement and a Disturbing Rumor about Google Search Engines A little bird passed me a rumor today that I can neither confirm or deny, but it's certainly worthy of discussion. The theory goes - when launching a new site, buying a significant quantity of AdWords/AdSense for the site is a good way to tell Google the site isn't spam and avoid long waits in the sandbox. Here's my take on this: There is some logic in the idea that a... Read this post K By: katfive August 2, 2006 Intruder Infiltrates YaHOO! Japan Search Engines If this were America, surely security would haul off this man in a heartbeat. But it's not. This is Japan, land of the weird and wacky (I know, did I mention I lived there for 10 months?) and Japanese comedian Razor Ramon merely brushes them aside with a... thru... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley August 2, 2006 Matt Cutts' Videos: Part 3 Search Engines Dear Mr. Cutts,I want to start off by saying thank you for taking time out of your undoubtedly busy life fielding SEO's most burning questions. That being said, I beg you to please stop answering questions via video. I've been chained to my desk for over a day now, and my skin has been rubbed raw from the cuff around my ankle (and from my unsuccessful attempts to gnaw off my own foot)....

Rand has chained me to my desk and ordered me to summarize the next set of videos released by Matt Cutts. This new batch of summaries is more verbatim than the last one, so enjoy.1. Does Google treat dynamic pages differently than static pages?... Read this post By: Rebecca Kelley July 31, 2006 Summary of Matt Cutts' Question-Fielding Videos Search Engines Via Threadwatch, I came across some Google videos of Matt Cutts fielding questions that he had received through his blog comments. I was initially quite interested in seeing the videos, as I thought he would be including demonstrations or visuals to aid in answering the qu...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 20, 2006 The Lurid Lives of Yahoo!'s Readership Search Engines I came across this banner ad from Yahoo! today and was a bit shocked.
