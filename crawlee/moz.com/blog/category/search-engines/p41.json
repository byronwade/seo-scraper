Search Engines Some of you may have read one of my first YOUmoz posts about Bounce Rates. Although others have discussed and blogged about user statistics, I think it's important to revisit the issue. Google's search results have been dancing for awhile lately, largely in part to the axe coming down on pai...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 10, 2007 When Google Comes Up Number One for Your Domain Name Search Engines SEOmoz's Q+A section has been a goldmine of eye-opening experiences for the entire staff, and never more so than when we see something so bizarre, so surprising, that it defies explanation. Tonight, we not only got to see one of these fascinating search riddles, we're actually able to share (a rare event as most domains with specific search problems ask to re...

For those wondering, I'm not an SEO expert, or a CEO or anything like that, I'm an IT Manager for a medium sized company. I've learned and applied concepts learned from my membership here at SeoMoz and a few other locations and it is... Read this post B By: Brent Payne November 30, 2007 New Google Features: Google Price Comparison Engine & Google Search 2.0 Search Engines One of the joys of working for one of the Top 200 eCommerce sites in the world is having the ability to have a direct dialogue with companies like Google.Today I was notified of two features (why, I won't get into and whom, I'll never release) that I think the SEOmoz readers would be interested in.<B>Google Becomes a Price Engine</b>1. Do a se... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 28, 2007 Complaining about Some Google Missteps Search Engines I don't generally like to pick on Google, or anyone else in particular for that matter, but since the search giant is hitting on all cylinders, I think they can probably take a little nudge or two. I'm going to keep this short, sweet and to the point (and also very self-centric, because it's tough to effectively analyze everything that might have happened on someone else's site): ... Read this post By: Hamlet Batista November 27, 2007 Training the Random Surfer: Two Important Adjustments to the Early PageRank Model Search Engines Many search marketers know about the ‘random surfer’ behind Google's PageRank (the real one, not the green bar also known as Google Toolbar PageRank). In Google’s own words, it’s described like this: PageRank can be thought of as a model of user behavior. We assume there is a \"random ...

Si was in town for the Thanksgiving holiday and generously contributed some time to the blog. Please welcome him!... Read this post By: buybigtires November 14, 2007 Is Google Trimming Its Index? Search Engines I was doing some routine research this morning, when I noticed a disturbing trend:Less search results for any given KW that I typed in. My search terms generally return results of 500k or more. Today, they return results of ~93k.So I did a search in the larger category. My search for \"tires\" turned up 5M results. Last week t...

Read this post D By: dave oremland November 8, 2007 Optimizing for Yahoo with the New Updates Search Engines I've been studying and somewhat practicing SEO for about 4 years--and I've never seen great descriptions of what works in Yahoo versus the other engines. In fact I haven't aggressively or consciously optimized for Yahoo EVER. Yet I was amazed to see that with the most recent update at the end of October '07, Y! had my main business site powerfully ranked with a ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 7, 2007 Yahoo! Panama - An Interview with Mona Elesseily Search Engines It's sad that we don't cover the paid side of search marketing here at SEOmoz with more frequency, but with a little luck and some elbow grease (or, at least, borrowed expertise), I'm trying to dip our toe a bit deeper. Thus, it's with great pleasure that I welcome Mona Elesseily from Page Zero. Mona's a paid search guru, a fellow Northwesterner (albeit a Canadian one) and one of my favori... Read this post By: MelGray November 5, 2007 Aggregate Detail on the Numbers from Google's October 2007 Toolbar PageRank Updates Search Engines Just a little under two weeks ago, we received numerous reports that a very large number of sites had experienced a sudden drop in Page Rank. Many immediately began claiming that Google had rolled out an update for its rank formula to penalize for paid links. Others played down these reports offering that their own sites had experienced no change at all. How do... Read this post D By: DerekDunne59 November 5, 2007 Protect Your Brand Variation Keywords from Google Search Engines Recently I have seen an increase in costs for our brand variation keywords, for example if “bluewidget” was our brand name I saw an increasing cost for “blue-widget” and “blue widget”. I checked this out by searching for “blue-widget” and “blue widget” and couldn’t see any other advertiser. Then, after 2 hours of head scratching I f... Read this post",
