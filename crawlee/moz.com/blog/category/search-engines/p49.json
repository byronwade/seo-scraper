Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 25, 2006 Lord of Yahoo!'s Short Tail Search Engines Someone has Yahoo!'s number down cold. Ranking on page one for thousands of the most popular search phrases in existence, the site isn't even offering content of its own - instead, they're aggregating content from others and serving what is, in essence, duplicated content that's been scraped and re-packaged. Their business model? Serving ads... What are they ranking for? phot...

I thought it would be worthwhile to explore some of the trends Yahoo! is pointing to out of self-interest and expand their definition for the whole of the web industry: ...

That' s not to say that many sites serving the Google ads don't rank well at Yahoo!, but rather that Yahoo! has some negative associations with AdSense serving content and won't be as friendly as they should be. I've heard this rumor two way... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 16, 2006 Dilbert on Google Search Engines Via an email from Joe Morin - Scott Adams takes a stab at the 'plex: ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 16, 2006 Reading Between the Lines on MC's Response to Sandbox Questions Search Engines I want to send out a big, electronic hug (and possibly another bottle of scotch) to Mike Grehan (wherever he might be this week). During his hour-long interview with Matt Cutts, Mike asked some of the very best questions I've heard/seen in the search industry field. Not only that, he got some real answers. From ...

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin March 26, 2006 Recipe Refinement Queries at Google Search Engines I couldn't find a good recipe for Chinese Beef & Broccoli at Epicurious this weekend, so I headed to Google, where, lo and behold, they have what appears to be another new feature - query refinement via recipes. I may have just been busy when the search blogs reported on this, but I can't seem to find it in archives at SEW or SERoundtable, either, so maybe it is new. Screenshot below for &q...
