  "content": "D By: Duncan Morris August 1, 2008 XML Sitemaps: Guidelines on Their Use Technical SEO Over the past couple of days I have been putting together some internal guidelines on various aspects of our jobs. This should ensure that we are giving consistent information to our various clients. Most of these guidelines have been fairly straightforward with nothing in them to write home about. However, one of the hardest guidelines to write has been the one talking about xml sitemaps. ...

Outdated inbound links and misspelled URLs (from less-than-careful webmasters) will send viewers to your site - but they'll land on your Page Not Found page - not on the page you'v... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin July 17, 2008 An SEOmoz PRO Tip (For Everyone) & Feedback About the PRO UI Technical SEO Lots and lots of people sign up for SEOmoz's PRO membership, and I have to tell you that on a personal level, every single one makes me feel honored, humble and yes, even a bit guilty about reading comic books last night instead of working on new tools/q+a/tips/etc. One of the big frustrations PRO members have, though, is that they can't find (or don't even know about) a lot of the cool st...

Google's indexing Flash and Flash developers can rejoice now that their content is SEO-friendly. Sorry - I don't buy it for a second. Flash content is fundamentally different from HTML on webpage URLs and being able to parse links in the Flash code and text snippets does not make F...

Technical SEO A quote from Google's Guidelines on Cloaking: Serving up different results based on user agent may cause your site to be perceived as deceptive and removed from the Google index. ... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin June 26, 2008 What Google Doesn't See CAN Hurt You (Update: But, in this case, it was cloaking) Technical SEO It's been a big month for false positives and getting caught with spam, and I've never been one to break up a theme. Short post, but an important one that every dev team should be aware of. The story starts with a smart SEOmoz member, Per Svanström, getting stumped by a perfectly legitimate, white hat subdirectory, with plenty of ... Read this post N By: Nuno Hipólito June 16, 2008 Toolbar PR of SEOmoz Users Profile Pages: A Case Study Technical SEO I've noticed for a while that my profile page on SEOmoz has no Toolbar PR. Actually, I noticed it more since I reached the 100 mozpoints mark - because when you reach 100, the link to the site on your profile page becomes \"follow\" instead of \"nofollow\", as you can read here. And it's always great to have a link from such a gre... Read this post D By: Duncan Morris June 11, 2008 Why Apple Isn't UK Enough for Google Technical SEO Did you know apple.com doesn't rank in google.co.uk with the \"pages from the uk\" flag checked? On further inspection this is because Apple uses Akamai which dynamically changes the dns settings to ensure the best user experience. Given that Googlebot always crawls from the US this means that the dns always returns a US based ip address, even though there are Akamai servers serving apples website in the UK.

When you don't know more information about the visitor (from sign-up information, cookie, etc.), the only way of doing this is through determining their location from their IP address. Whenever you start talking about selectively delivering content based on IP address, the topic of cloaking inevitably comes up.

Read this post By: Rand Fishkin May 7, 2008 10 Clear Questions for the Engines that Deserve Some Answers Technical SEO Over the past few days, I've seen a lot of questions in our Q+A section and across the blogosphere that suggest it's time for some direct answers from the search engines on major issues that affect business practices, consulting and website building. Here are the ones I believe are in desperate need of straight responses: To all the engines - does content on subdomains i...
