Read this post A By: Abdul Khimani October 25, 2011 Solving New Content Indexation Issues for Large Websites Technical SEO In my own personal experience with working on SEO projects over the last four years, there have been numerous instances where a website undergoes a major revamp or you take up an ongoing SEO project and discover content indexation issues. The case I am specifically referring to is when you have a large number of old website pages that were not 301 redirected or removed using a 404 (not ideal) or just plain old content that lingers on in Google's index because it was just only delinked from the website's internal linking schema (we've all been there, right?)
