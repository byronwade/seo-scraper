Subdomains - the \"third level\" domain name; these are free to create under any root domain you own/control. Read this post By: Casey Henry January 6, 2009 Do Sitemaps Affect Crawlers? Technical SEO Like any other person out there, I fall into habits, good and bad. Recently while working on a client’s website, I created a Sitemap and submitted it to the search engines, like I always do. I started to think if this really helps the site out and what’s the effect when I submit a Sitemap on the site. Read this post By: Rand Fishkin December 11, 2008 Differential Diagnosis #2: A Double Mystery Technical SEO I've been watching a lot more of the Dr. House show, and becoming a bit obsessed with some SEO mysteries of my own. Since our last outing into diagnosis went so well, I thought we'd try again. I haven't got either completely solved, but I feel pretty good about some hypotheses. Let's see how you... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin November 27, 2008 Footer Link Optimization for Search Engines and User Experience Technical SEO Site after site that I visit lately has been showing a tendency for using footer links to run their internal SEO link structure and anchor text optimization. While this practice, in years past, held value, today I rarely ever recommend it. Here's why: Footer links may be devalued by search engines automatically Footer links are often not the first link on t... Read this post By: Rishi Lakhani October 31, 2008 URL Tagging: Clean Up Your Act Technical SEO It was quite by chance I stumbled upon this issue early last year, while working on a project (and to be honest, it was the team at Latitude that picked up on it). Basically, one of the sites I was working on with them had some serious bloat in search results, and after digging into the situation, the solution was pretty simple. Although I cannot mention the site here because of NDA’s, I can give you an example of a site that suffers the same problem, and hopefully will give you an idea into how to manage the problem for your own/client sites. Read this post D By: Duncan Morris October 30, 2008 What Quantum of Solace Can Tell Us About Information Architecture Technical SEO I've said it before, and no doubt I'll say it again: in my opinion, the number one reason for websites failing online is because they have a poor information architecture. Don't worry, I'm not going to compare myself to Bond. Instead, I'm going to use Quantum of Solace to demonstrate how something as simple as categorizing a new action movie can lead to some serious problems in your site architecture. (Just for the record, I tend to use the phrases 'site' or 'information architecture' interchangeably to cover a multitude of sins.) Read this post B By: Ben Hendrickson October 20, 2008 Why New Content Briefly Flickers Out Of Google Technical SEO A few days after new content shows up in Google, it will sometimes flicker out of the SERPS for a few hours. Apparently, this is common knowledge to some SEOs. This is not common knowledge to programmers like me, and I nearly made a tin foil hat in preparation for the googlicopters when I learned the project (Linkscape) that I'd worked on for months had disappeared from all SERPs on th... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin October 14, 2008 PageRank Sculpting: Parsing the Value and Potential Benefits of Sculpting PR with Nofollow Technical SEO Thanks to the SEOmoz Q+A, we get to monitor a lot of the hot button issues that hit the SEO world, and as Jane noted to me during a meeting today, they always seem to come in waves. The latest buzz (and flurry of questions) comes around the practice of PageRank Sculpting. We've discussed this topic in some detail previously on SEOmoz (... Read this post By: Andrew Miller October 2, 2008 Programmers Deserve Love Too Technical SEO If you are like most SEO's I meet, you are probably not doing the majority of the programming and development work for your clients or company. Those of us from the marketing side of the business frequently rely on professionals to do the heavy lifting during the implementation stages of an SEO campaign. I've had the privilege of working with very smart and talented web developers in my... Read this post J By: JeremyChatfield September 25, 2008 IIS Case Folding, Robots and Results Technical SEO For the last few years, I've been doing some SEO on Apache sites. Suddenly, this year, I've had a clutch of IIS sites to handle and I'm seeing some puzzling and worrying things, which appear to be caused by the way that Microsoft defaults to \"caseless\" file systems. Worrying things as in \"damaging to search engine results\". I can't find any guidance from Micr... Read this post By: Rand Fishkin September 23, 2008 Dynamic URLs vs. Static URLs - The Best Practice for SEO is Still Clear Technical SEO Google's got a blog post out today (and SELand covers it) about how they now recommend that webmasters and site owners DO NOT rewrite their ugly dynamic URLs to be clean and static. What's the reasoning behind this? ... Read this post M By: Michael Sparer September 12, 2008 How to Use Robots.txt and Redirects the Wrong Way Technical SEO I got inspired by Rebecca Kelley's post about Newbie Mistakes and instantly two and a half newbie mistakes came to my mind. They are a bit on the technical side of things, but not too much to be understood by all of you mozzers :-)1. Robots.txt is no security layer... Read this post By: Jane Copland August 27, 2008 Seven Things That Reality Could Borrow From The Internet Technical SEO The Internet, as fragile and infuriating and enigmatic as its features can be, certainly has some great features that I'd really like to see implemented, at least for beta testing, in reality. Redirecting phone numbers. When I moved to Seattle (two years ago last Saturday), I acquired a local number. In the days before Facebook became microchipped into everyone's forehead, I had lit...

I was saying to myself \"This is overstating the importance of domains. Google doesnt really care about this stuff.\"A day later in the news. \"Google offers 6 figures for knol.com\"Google cares about names. As does Apple. As does any company that knows the web. So let's talk about the looming battle fo... Read this post",
