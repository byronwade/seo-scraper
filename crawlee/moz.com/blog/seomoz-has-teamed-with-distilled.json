Table of Contents Copied! By: Scott Willoughby May 22, 2008 SEOmoz Has Teamed with Distilled The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. SEOmoz is very happy to announce that we've recently teamed up with our first ever Global Associate, Distilled. Many of you will know and recognize Will, Duncan and Tom from their participation on the blog. Over the years, we've gotten to know these guys quite well and have been continually impressed by their knowledge, talent, professionalism, expertise, and attentiveness to all things SEO. We also think they're a great bunch of guys and we share very similar business philosophies. We are extremely proud to have them, and the entire Distilled team, partnering with SEOmoz in this unique new way. With the rapid growth we've seen over the last six months, it was time to team up with a talented group of search experts to assist us with the ever-increasing demands on our business and expand our ability to address complex SEO issues for our PRO Members and clients. Distilled was an obvious choice for us as they bring a global perspective and particular expertise in international issues, along with top-class SEO expertise. As SEOmoz Global Associates, they will work directly and very closely with us in our engagements with large, international clients, as well as our rapidly growing PRO Membership base. By partnering with the team at Distilled in this fashion, we will be able to continue offering the level of expertise, service, and support our PRO Members and clients have come to know and expect from SEOmoz. It will allow us to keep response time in PRO Q&A down, improve and increase the frequency and type of content on the blog, and allow us to work with more large, internationally-focused clients. While we don't currently have any plans to add other Global Associates, we hope this model will be successful for everyone involved and anticipate further growth in the future. In the coming weeks and months, you will likely notice Will, Duncan and Tom taking on an even more active, high profile role on the blog. You'll be able to easily pick them out by the gray 'SEOmoz Associate' badges under their avatars. PRO Members will also notice these three, as well as Lucy, Rob and Richard, participating in PRO Q&A. We are extremely excited to have these amazing folks working with us to enhance the offerings and reach of SEOmoz. We couldn't ask for a better group to engage as our inaugural partners in this new model for service offerings and growth. PS-Will and Tom will be joining us for SMX Advanced in Seattle in a couple of weeks. They'll likely be hanging around with us quite a bit, so swing by our booth and say 'hi' if you're one of the lucky folks who will be attending this sold-out event. Copied! Back to Top",
