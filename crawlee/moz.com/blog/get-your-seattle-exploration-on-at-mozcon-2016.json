We've got fewer than 60 tickets left, so grab yours now. Buy your MozCon 2016 ticket! If you haven't done so, check out all the learning! This post is geared toward the things you can do when MozCon sessions aren't happening. Places you'll want to go as recommended by Mozzers While you're in Seattle, we want to make sure you have a fabulous time. Seattle in September is beautiful. It's still sunny outside, and it's the time of year people come to Seattle and then want to move here. So we've complied a list of great activities and restaurants:Sights Gasworks Park\"Incredible views of the city, float planes landing overhead, Space Needle in the background, Ivar's Clam Chowder down the street, bikes all over the place.\" — Brian Childs Volunteer Park \"This is my favorite place in all of Seattle! Stroll around the park and stop in the Seattle Asian Art Museum and the conservatory, then climb to the top of the water tower for an incredible view. You can also walk through the graveyard and see Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee's grave. After all that walking, hop over to the adorable and delicious Volunteer Park Cafe.\" — Megan Singley Elliott Bay Trail \"Amazing views, has a mini gravel beach, and lots of park space. Great for running and cycling. I ride my bike along EBT nearly everyday to Moz, and I fall in love with city over and over again.\" — James Daugherty Alki Beach \"Alki is a beautiful walk with a spectacular view of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. It's got some good restaurants, and even a little history as the site of the original settlement.\" — Maura Hubbell Discovery Park \"If you've never been to the Pacific Northwest (or even if you have!), Discovery Park on a clear day is a great place to see the Olympic Mountains, Puget Sound, Mt. Rainier, and to get some quality forest walking done all in one fell swoop. Plus, it's 20 minutes from downtown! (Pro tip: For the easiest view access, park in the lot on W Emerson just before 43rd Ave W.)\" — Rachel Moore Green Lake \"People of every ilk converge to exercise, feed ducks, play with dogs, and covet the dogs of others.\" — Felicia Crawford Activities, tours, and museums The Underground Tour\"What a great way to hear about and experience early-Seattle's history!\" — Emily Smollen Ferry to Bainbridge Island \"Seattle is surrounded by water and mountains. The ferry is the easiest way to experience that scenery. The view of the city is amazing too!\" — Alyson Murphy The Pinball Museum \"It is special to me because I've only been to Seattle once, as I work remotely in the UK. It was a joy the see how strong the love for pinball is in Seattle. The Pinball Museum houses the world's biggest pinball machine, and it is really something to behold; it's like hugging a dining room table.\" — Jo Cameron Restaurants and bars Linda's\"Laid back, good music, cheap food, and nice people.\" — Nicelle Herron Cyclops \"If you are a vegetarian (or love vegetarian food), the Happy Hippy Burger is a must. It is not only the best veggie burger in Seattle, but it's the best I have ever had. Cyclops also has great drinks and food for the omnivores, too.\" — Chiaryn Miranda Pie Bar \"This hole in the wall has it all! Pie Bar serves up warm, freshly baked slices of heaven with a pint of bliss. Savory pies, sweet pies, pietinis, craft spirits, and beer...all nestled in an elegant, cozy venue where you won't have to shout over a crowd 3-hipsters-deep to order. And if you're done with your pie and ready for some pinball and arcade games, John John's Game Room is directly next door!\" — Jess Stipe Oddfellows Cafe \"This hip little eatery has some awesomely tasty foods, a sweet little private back patio, a laidback atmosphere, and awesome drinks. Plus, it's right in the heart of Capitol Hill, one of my favorite 'hoods in the city.\" — Tawny Case Bonus! Lightning suggestions: The Fat Hen Smith Bottega Italiana Cafe Turko Shorty's Omega Ouzeri Sushi Kashiba Métier Seattle General Porpoise Doughnuts Sizzle Pie Holy Mountain Brewing Herb and Bitter Lionhead Optimism Brewery Meet the Moon Bar Melusine Brian Childs' recommendation corner \"I put this Google map together for friends visiting the city.
