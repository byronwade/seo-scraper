By: Rebecca Kelley August 16, 2006 Matt Cutts and I are BFF Search Engines The author's views are entirely their own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz. Hey everyone, Rebecca here. I'm back from San Jose (and San Diego for a brief R&R), and I have GREAT news. Apparently my toiling over transcribing Matt Cutts' videos has paid off big time, because he and I are totally BFF (best friends forever). Seriously, check this out: We're good friends who share a great rapport (his words!). If we weren't, we wouldn't be taking a photo together, right? Matt, or \"Mattie C\", as I affectionately call him (cuz we're so chummy and all) totally gets me. My friends get me, but Matt gets me, you know? It's totally different with your BFF. Sure, Matt's friends with Rand, too, and sure, he loves SEOmoz: ...but the thing is that Rand and Matt are all business. Mattie C doesn't tell Rand stuff he'd tell only his BFF, like, for example, how his favorite movie is Pootie Tang, or how he likes getting no-polish manicures because sometimes it's nice to feel dainty and pampered. He tells me these things because we're close friends.*update* Well, clearly Matt's disclaimer is meant for all those stalker SEO Cuttlets out there and not for yours truly, because my friendship with Mattie C is 100% au natural. No amount of blog posts, cease and desists, or restraining orders will ever change that...ever... Copied! Back to Top",
