Below is a list of 17 tips that‚Äôll improve your content marketing and help you get more visitors, leads, and sales. Contents1. Focus on SEOIf you rank for topics that people are searching for, you can get consistent search traffic. Here‚Äôs how to find these topics: Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Keywords ExplorerEnter a topic relevant to your industry Go to the Matching terms report You‚Äôll see 3+ million potential topics you could target. Look through the list and pick out those that are relevant to your website. Further readingKeyword Research: The Beginner‚Äôs Guide by Ahrefs2. Know your audienceIf you create content for the wrong people, visitors won‚Äôt translate into customers or clients. For example, if a conversion rate optimization (CRO) agency writes about CRO, they might attract fellow professionals rather than genuine leads. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to clearly define your audience. If you already know who you‚Äôre targeting, make sure to get it down in writing and share it with your entire team. Otherwise, use the template below to figure it out for your business. Further readingHow to Create a Buyer Persona for Your Business3. Swipe competitors‚Äô best topicsIf you know which of your competitors‚Äô articles get the most search traffic, you could replicate their success. Here‚Äôs how to find their best topics: Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Site ExplorerEnter a competitor‚Äôs domain Go to the Top pages report You‚Äôll see their top pages by search traffic and the keyword that sends each page the most traffic. For example, we can see that Beardbrand‚Äôs article on beard styles gets an estimated 51K monthly search visits. The keyword sending it the most traffic is ‚Äúbeard styles.‚Äù If we owned a competing ecommerce store, we could tackle this topic, too. 4. Prioritize topics with business valueTopics have high ‚Äúbusiness value‚Äù if you can naturally mention your product or service in the content. You should prioritize these as they‚Äôre most likely to generate sales or leads. For example, here‚Äôs how we score topics at Ahrefs: We try to prioritize topics that score 2 and above. Pairing business value with search traffic potential keeps us focused on creating content that actually drives growth.5. Optimize for search intentSearch intent is the why behind a search query. If you want to rank high on Google, you‚Äôll need to match it. Since Google‚Äôs goal is to provide users with the most relevant search results, we can look at the search engine results pages (SERPs) to figure out search intent. For example, if we Google ‚Äúbest headphones‚Äù, here‚Äôs what we see: From the search results, it‚Äôs clear that people are looking for an up-to-date list of the best headphones on the market. If you‚Äôre targeting this topic, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll have to create something similar.Further readingSearch Intent in SEO: What It Is & How to Optimize for It6. Create a content calendarA content calendar is a system for organizing, managing, and scheduling upcoming content. It keeps track of all publishing efforts and lists information such as: TopicAuthorContributorsStatusDue dateThis keeps everyone aligned and is the reason why we‚Äôve been able to publish at least two blog posts a week for the past few years. Further readingHow to Create a Content Calendar That Works For You7. Design shareable imagesPeople often share images that simplify complex topics. This gets your content in front of more people. For example, our SEO checklist illustration got 1,000+ likes and 300+ reposts: Looking for a complete SEO checklist for 2021?Here‚Äôs one you can follow. pic.twitter.com/65brjXPBcg‚Äî Ahrefs (@ahrefs) August 15, 2021 We have in-house illustrators who create our images. But you don‚Äôt have to break the bank to design one. The blog WaitButWhy uses hand-drawn cartoons and stick figures and is still popular. This image got 8,000+ likes, 1,700 reports, and reached 1.6 million views on Twitter. Imagine human history were written in a big 1,000-page book. Every page would cover 250 years. If we tore out all the pages, it would look like this.The very earliest permanent settlements started around page 760 and recorded history doesn‚Äôt start until around page 775.1/5 pic.twitter.com/Jr9o1FE7lG‚Äî Tim Urban (@waitbutwhy) March 15, 2023 Tools like Canva also make it easy to create shareable images. 8. Promote content across channelsIf you don‚Äôt put your content in front of people who care, your newly published content will be invisible. To promote our content, we: Include the best posts of the week in our newsletter Encourage each author to share what they‚Äôve created on their socials Reach out to people we mention in our content Run ads on platforms like Facebook and Twitter You‚Äôll have to do at least this much to get your content out. If you have a new site, even more. Further reading21 Content Promotion Strategies (To Get More Traffic to Your Content)9. Repurpose top-performing contentContent repurposing is where you turn existing content into another format. For example, we turned our guide to influencer marketing into a video. I also turned my blog post on the Skyscraper Technique into a X (Twitter) thread.That way, the content you‚Äôve created doesn‚Äôt end after hitting ‚Äòpublish.‚Äô It goes the extra mile to reach more people without you having to create new content from scratch. Further reading13 Smart Ways to Repurpose Content10. Don‚Äôt sweat the word countOur study of 900 million pages showed that the average 10,000-word post gets less search traffic than the average 2,000-word post. Put simply: Longer does not mean more organic traffic. So‚Ä¶ stop obsessing over word count. No one wants to read longer content. Cover as deep as needed, cut out the unimportant aspects, and get to the point. 11. Keep your content updatedWhen I updated my post on free SEO tools, traffic shot up: Content can go ‚Äúbad.‚Äù Information can become outdated, your target keyword‚Äôs search intent can change, and your rankings can drop. When that happens, you‚Äôll have to update your content. The easiest way to find out which content to refresh is to install our free WordPress SEO plugin and run an audit. The audit will tell you which articles you should be updating. Further readingRepublishing Content: How to Update Old Blog Posts for SEO12. Be opinionatedIf your content is exactly like everyone else‚Äôs, then there‚Äôs no reason to click, read, share, or link to your content over others. You want your content to stand out. And the best way to do that is to share an opinion. For example, our Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Tim Soulo wrote a rant about bad email outreach a few years ago. It was incredibly popular and got 2,200 backlinks from 469 unique websites: In fact, people still reference the guide on social media today: Lol. Does this email make any sense to you, @timsoulo? They should have read your guides on outreach! üôÇ pic.twitter.com/yVRSxMWk76‚Äî Dixon Jones (@Dixon_Jones) June 28, 2023 Literally, it is a gemüíéhttps://t.co/yAzPRE4bQz@ahrefs @timsoulo‚Äî Meet Soni (@meetsoni1214) January 13, 2023 In a world where everyone can generate content freely via AI, having a strong opinion will help differentiate your content and make it unique.Further readingOpinions aren‚Äôt optional in content marketing13. Publish different content typesYou cannot expect each piece of content you create to hit all your content marketing goals. You need a variety. Depending on your goals, you‚Äôll likely need: Search-optimized content to acquire search traffic Linkbait to attract backlinks Sales enablement content to help your sales team close deals Thought leadership content to build authority in your industry For example, content designed to rank isn‚Äôt the only type of content we create. We also publish data studies (for thought leadership and links), product updates (for retention), opinion pieces (for thought leadership), and free tools (for lead generation). 14. Build content hubsContent hubs are interlinked collections of content about a similar topic. For example, our beginner‚Äôs guide to SEO is a collection of our best guides: Since our blog is displayed reverse chronologically, a hub page helps our readers discover our content in an organized manner. If you have tons of amazing content, create hub pages to link them together. Further readingContent Hubs for SEO: How to Get More Traffic and Links With Topic Clusters15. Use AI tools as a content partnerYour goal as a content marketer is not to avoid AI writing tools, but to play to their strengths. For example, you can use ChatGPT or our free AI writing tools to complete menial tasks like: Brainstorm headlines and titles Come up with potential blog post ideas Expand article outlines Reword sentencesWhip up quick conclusions This will free up your time to do what matters: create a solid content strategy, interview subject-matter experts, inject personal experiences, come up with opinions, and more.

Publish original researchJournalists and bloggers are always on the lookout for data and statistics to back up their claims. That explains why our most linked-to pages are mostly research studies: We‚Äôre lucky because we have tons of big data to work with. But anyone can publish original research. You can run a poll on Twitter or LinkedIn, create a survey, or partner with someone who has access to data. You could even use publicly available data and create your own methodology, like what Asher & Lyric did when they ranked the best countries to raise a family:Their post received a total of 322 backlinks from 201 referring domains: 17. Reach more people with videosThere are plenty of reasons to create video content: YouTube is the second most popular search engine in the world. Not only is video engaging and interactive, it helps to demonstrate your product or service in action. This is why we‚Äôve heavily invested in creating YouTube content since 2018. It has paid off for us‚Äîwe have 21+ million lifetime views and over 450,000 subscribers on our channel:Most importantly, it drives new customers: If your content marketing focus has only been on written content, it‚Äôs time to consider creating YouTube videos too.
