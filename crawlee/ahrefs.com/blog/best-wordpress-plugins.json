WordPress sites are often vulnerable to hacking, so these are important.WordfenceCost: Free ($119/year for premium)Useful for: Keeping your website safe from hackers and malwareWordfence adds a robust firewall and malware scanner to protect your site from hackers and malicious software. You can also use it to add two-factor login authentication, have rate limiting, and run security diagnostics on your site—to name a few of the features. UpdraftPlusCost: Free ($119/year for premium)Useful for: Backing up your WordPress websiteIt’s important to back up your website every so often to avoid losing your content in the event of a plugin clash, hack, or even accidental deletion. UpdraftPlus makes this easy for you.Wordablehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_7y3JvHuHkCost: Free ($50/month for premium)Useful for: Uploading content from Google Docs to WordPress at the click of a buttonWordable makes it easy to upload content from Google Docs to your WordPress website (including images, formatting, etc., without any extra hidden code).

It can automate tasks like sharing a post to social media or in a newsletter when it’s published, track data in a spreadsheet whenever a product is purchased, and a million other things. Its only limit is your own creativity.WP Simple PayCost: $49.50–$299.50/year (depending on tier)Useful for: Adding a simple Stripe payment processor to your siteWP Simple Pay makes it easy to accept Stripe payments on your website.

To help you speed up your WordPress site, you can consider using these plugins.NitroPackhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6PWisJXFqACost: $17.50–$146.67/month (depending on tier)Useful for: An all-in-one tool to speed up your websiteNitroPack is my favorite all-in-one speed enhancer, with smart caching, image optimization, a built-in CDN, and more—all without needing developer experience. However, it’s not cheap. If you need a more affordable option, look at the next two plugins.WP RocketCost: $59–$299/year (depending on tier)Useful for: Adding website cachingWP Rocket adds caching to your WordPress website, allowing you to improve your loading speeds and Core Web Vitals score. However, it doesn’t have image optimization or a CDN, so it’s missing features compared to NitroPack. That’s where the next plugin comes in.AutoptimizeCost: FreeUseful for: Adding website speed optimization features like image compressionAutoptimize fills in the gaps left by WP Rocket. It can aggregate, minify and cache scripts and styles, inject CSS in the page head by default, optimize and lazy-load images, and much more. However, it does require some learning and tweaking, so it’s not very beginner-friendly.Best WordPress plugins for marketingTraffic is what makes your website valuable.

But it seems like a fun thing to test for e-commerce websites.Thrive Quiz BuilderCost: $99/year (or $299/year for the entire Thrive Suite)Useful for: Creating quizzes on your site that are easily shareableThrive Quiz Builder makes it easy to, well, build quizzes. You can use it to make one of those viral Facebook quizzes moms love to take and share their results. Smash BalloonCost: $49–$299/year (depending on which feeds you want)Useful for: Adding social media feeds to your websiteSmash Balloon makes displaying feeds from your social media profiles on your WordPress website easy. This is helpful if you want to showcase your photography or video services or rely heavily on social media for sponsorships. Best WordPress plugins for SEOSearch engine optimization (SEO) is an important part of growing your website. In my experience, the following plugins are the best WordPress SEO plugins.Yoast SEO/Rank Math/SEOPressCost: Free (various paid options)Useful for:Basic on-page SEOCreating a robots.txt file and sitemapEasily editing metadata These types of plugins are essential for a WordPress website. They allow you to edit important SEO options on your pages and make implementing SEO on your site much easier and more streamlined.Of these three, my personal favorite is Rank Math. I have used Yoast SEO and SEOPress, but I like the team behind Rank Math the most and find the plugin to be easy to use with a solid UI. They’re all great, however, and do pretty much the same things. Just pick one.Ahrefs’ WordPress SEO PluginCost: FreeUseful for: Suggesting ways to better optimize your content to rank higher in search resultsOur SEO plugin makes it easy to automate content audits, monitor backlinks, and grow organic traffic to your WordPress website.
