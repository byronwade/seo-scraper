Patches can also be site-wide. Did Site Audit find internal links leading to broken pages?Same thing – click on “Patch it”, enter new target URLs, and hit publish to redirect or replace multiple pages with a different URL.We’re also working on an option to automatically submit patched pages to IndexNow, so you can immediately inform search engines of changes.Patches statesPatches can be saved as drafts, published, or unpublished, so you don’t have to stress out over making a mistake or wanting to undo a patch.You can also track the full history of any patch.Patches reportView, search for, and manage all patches from the Patches report.You’ll eventually be able to filter patches by:ActionStatusUser or targetPlus, publish or unpublish patches in bulk.Setting up PatchesWe plan to have two deployment methods:JavaScript snippet Add a JavaScript snippet to your website pages that calls a unique JavaScript file hosted by Ahrefs.
