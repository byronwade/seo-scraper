I don’t think you’re missing out if you don’t pay.The anatomy of a “premium” promptPretty much all of the “engineered” prompts we tested had a similar structure.I tried to break down what I saw:Specifically, here are the patterns:Role — Asks ChatGPT to act as a professional or expert with specific skill sets.Target language — Asks ChatGPT to respond in a particular language.Ultra-specific instructions — Asks ChatGPT to do XYZ action in extreme detail.Emphasis on human-like writing — Asks ChatGPT to write in a specific tone or style.Specific output — Asks ChatGPT to structure its response in a specific format, such as markdown, tables, code boxes, etc.The takeawayThis experiment is by no means academic nor scientific. It’s just a fun, informal test to see if “engineered” prompts could perform better than a simple command—at least according to human interpretation.Based on the results, though, I’m not convinced that “premium” prompts really do that much for you. It’s probably better to start off simple and then refine accordingly.So, don’t waste your money. Use it to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus instead.What do you think? Let me know on Twitter X.
