I spoke with two influencers—Wes Kao and Matt Diggity—for their best tips on establishing a name for yourself online.ContentsWhat is a personal brand, really?A personal brand is how people perceive you and what you’re known for. It’s the skills, experience, and values that give you an edge over others.Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman is one example. He helms and hosts the science/health podcast Huberman Lab, lectures at Stanford Medicine, and has earned media mentions from the likes of BBC, TIME, and more.Andrew’s personal brand is built on his credibility and areas of expertise. Many of his posts attract thousands of likes and hundreds of comments on X and LinkedIn.If we want to dig deeper, Maven and altMBA co-founder Wes Kao has a somewhat alternative take on the definition:In my opinion, it’s better to reframe ‘personal branding’ into ‘personal credibility.’ Personal branding has a superficial undertone. It assumes you have your work, then you tack on an artificial layer of ‘branding’ to shape perceptions.Wes Kao, Co-founder MavenShe suggests that personal credibility is about substance: Showing people what you do, how you think, and how you can contribute. Wes adds:In this way, you build deeper connections with people who believe in your work—which means stronger relationships, more control, and more opportunities.Wes Kao, Co-founder MavenIn this podcast interview snippet with Nick Bennett, SparkToro’s Amanda Natividad echoes Wes’ sentiment: People generally don’t like the term [personal brand] because it sounds disingenuous and icky. Acknowledging the existence of your personal brand is admitting that you care what others think about you, and that you find ways to manage those expectations at scale.Amanda Natividad, VP Marketing SparkToroBenefits of building a personal brandWild as it sounds, building a solid personal brand gives you more control over your life.A strong following could:Expand your realm of influence, particularly in your area of expertise (i.e., be viewed as a subject matter expert).Boost your credibility, in turn allowing you to promote your company/product better.Build a loyal following independent of the company you’re working for (or if you own that company, create more positive sentiment towards it).Open doors to job, networking, and investment opportunities.Chiangmai SEO conference founder Matt Diggity shares some excellent points in his Facebook post on the topic, too.How to build a personal brandThere’s no linear path to building your personal brand.As a precursor to the below steps, let’s first talk about finding your “voice.”Wes and Matt both emphasize the importance of staying true to yourself. That means not crafting an online persona of who you think you should be.I try to write like how I sound in person. Talking and writing are different media, so you shouldn’t try to match the two in a literal sense, but you want to capture your overall spirit. For example, I have a hint of snark in my writing because that’s how I sound in person.Wes Kao, Co-founder MavenMatt echoes this sentiment: How I talk on the internet is how I talk IRL. If I’m not having a f**king blast on my YouTube videos, I won’t do them. It has to be fun.Matt Diggity, Founder Diggity MarketingKeep this idea in mind as you go through the steps below.Step 1: Position yourself Think of yourself as a product: What are your strengths, obsessions, and areas of expertise?If you’re well-versed in technical SEO or a seasoned entrepreneur, these might be your unique selling points.From there, double down on something you would be excited to think, write, and talk about for years—because “it will likely take years to get to where you want to go,” says Wes.As an optional next step, consider solidifying your position with a spiky POV—a term coined by Wes, and which she cautions should be used with care.A spiky POV is not about a contrarian hot take for the sake of it. In 2023, social platforms are flooded with hot takes and generic advice. I think about respecting the intelligence of my audience and teaching them something they don’t already know. A true spiky POV is rooted in deep expertise, including recognizing the limitations and counterpoints of your idea. This builds your reputation as someone who is rigorous and worth the time to engage with.Wes Kao, Co-founder MavenHere’s a LinkedIn post by Wes that combines all of the above: a unique perspective backed by her personal experiences, with a takeaway for the audience too. In other words—a spiky, worthy POV.Step 2: Start sharing publiclyYou already knew this, but social media platforms are one of the best ways to get growth and build your name. It’s your chance to build your reputation in a public arena.Wes, Amanda, and Matt each utilized a combination of online channels to promote their voice and content. It’s one of the first things you should do—because your content is really only as good as its reach.This is the first thing I did to build a personal brand and authority in the SEO industry, and I still do it to this day…Take an hour a week, go to SEO social media hangouts (SEO Facebook groups, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc) and go from top-to-bottom answering people’s questions.…— Matt Diggity (@mattdiggityseo) September 27, 2023 This doesn’t mean cross-posting your content across more platforms than you can manage, of course.Study where your target audience spends most of their time, then hone in on those platforms (ideally, stick to no more than 2-3).In Matt’s case, his followers are primarily on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube—and that’s where his SEO-led content thrives.If creating whole posts from scratch seems daunting, start by commenting thoughtfully in relevant online communities. Obviously, do it with heart:This is the first thing I did to build a personal brand and authority in the SEO industry, and I still do it to this day…Take an hour a week, go to SEO social media hangouts (SEO Facebook groups, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc) and go from top-to-bottom answering people’s questions.…— Matt Diggity (@mattdiggityseo) September 27, 2023 Here are some simple ways to start.LinkedIn: Contribute to a collaborative articleYou might have seen these articles floating around LinkedIn—perhaps even been invited to add your insights to them.These blog posts are similar to Wikipedia pages: LinkedIn users build on each AI-generated article with their perspectives, and readers can choose to react to these additions or engage with the content.Here’s an example of what a contribution looks like:Reddit: Weigh in on discussionsGo to a relevant subreddit, e.g. r/bigSEOSort by “Top” and “This Week”Browse the questions or discussions and offer your two cents where relevant.Ride on trending topicsFound an interesting insight on X or someplace else? Turn it into a poll, question, or post. (Be sure to also tag and credit the author!)Zero-Click Content: It’s not just Google. It’s social media channels, too… So… what are we supposed to do when the platforms reward Zero-Click behavior? @amandanat explains here: https://t.co/f5rsFYUvhA pic.twitter.com/kTeO6h4om8— Aleyda Solis 🕊️ (@aleyda) July 26, 2022 Bring it all togetherIf some of your responses or posts get traction, repurpose those answers into new content: a blog post, video, or series of social posts.(PSST: Learn more about my process behind curating and repurposing content for Ahrefs’ X account.)This segues into our next and final step:Step 3: Double down on what worksBy now, you should have an idea of which topics you’re most comfortable discussing at length—and what resonates most with your target audience.You can further maximize your reach by doubling down on the things that have brought you success. Or, more specifically, by repurposing popular content in other formats and creating more content about similar things.For instance, we turned this popular video on how to use ChatGPT for SEO into a Twitter thread and LinkedIn post—and later, a blog post.ChatGPT for SEO: 11 best and worst use cases 🤖We’ve done the work so you don’t have to!Let’s take a closer look—plus, some tactics and prompts to improve SEO for your website ⛏️H/T: @samsgoh pic.twitter.com/vklQfL7LiA— Ahrefs (@ahrefs) February 17, 2023 Wes has also done this plenty with her “eaten the bear” analogy over the years. She first wrote about it in this 2019 blog post, rewrote it in 2023, and shares variations of the analogy on LinkedIn and X every few months.Each time, these posts garner hundreds or thousands of likesToo much backstory is one of the biggest killers of good stories.Backstory scope creep is real. We’ve all been there: Long-winded, stream of conscious explanations—all in the name of “giving context.“I’ve been guilty of it myself.The solution?Minimum viable backstory pic.twitter.com/XFe2wAJysg— Wes Kao 🏛 (@wes_kao) October 3, 2023 Don’t let your success die there, though. You can find more content ideas that will resonate with your audience by doing some keyword research around your topic. Here’s how:Plug your target topic into Ahrefs’ Keywords ExplorerGo to the Matching terms reportFor example, if we enter “chatgpt seo,” we see that people are searching for ChatGPT prompts for SEO and ChatGPT SEO extensions:Given how our audience is interested in ChatGPT and SEO, these would be great topics to create content about—whether that be social media posts, videos, blog posts, or something else.

Engage consistently with your followers and others’ content. Human connections are worth their weight in gold when you’re trying to get your personal brand off the ground.In a world obsessed with automation and AI, never underestimate the power of human connection in business.Personal branding is your secret weapon.— Matt Diggity (@mattdiggityseo) November 2, 2023 Maintain consistency across your social media profilesThis means using the same profile picture across all platforms, and a standardized bio so others can quickly get a sense of who you are and what you often post about.Jack Appleby is a great example. The creator/consultant is behind Future Social, an independent social strategy newsletter with 56,000+ subscribers.Notice how he maintains consistency on X and LinkedIn:Ahrefs’ Tim Soulo further explains the importance of your profile picture in personal branding here:Your profile pic is your “personal branding” tool. (duh!)My journey so far:2009 - “I have no idea what I’m doing;“2014 - I want to stand out & be memorable;2018 - I want to look provocative;2020 - I want to look professional.I can expand this into a thread if you want 😉 pic.twitter.com/W7FtZTcYGO— Tim Soulo 🇺🇦 (@timsoulo) September 14, 2020 Be yourselfRemember how Wes and Matt shared the importance of staying true to yourself? We couldn’t emphasize that enough.Final thoughtsThese steps aren’t exhaustive, obviously. To truly stand out online, Wes suggests having a combination of these things: social proof, good design sense, strong writing, interesting insights, and a track record of contribution.As she puts it: All these things will make people think, ‘This person knows their craft.’Wes Kao, Co-founder MavenHave a thought about this blog post?
