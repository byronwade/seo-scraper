We have one new feature in Site Audit, and two general updates.Let’s get right into it – use the sidebar to jump to updates for a specific tool.1. Site AuditCore Web Vitals charts and scoresEarlier this year, we added Core Web Vitals data to Site Audit. Quick refresher: these are a set of speed metrics that are used to measure user experience signals. They show you how your pages perform based on data taken from real users.We’ve now added charts and scores for CWV as well. Head into any Site Audit crawl and click on your Performance report to see them. With this, you have a visualization of CrUX data and Lighthouse scores, their historical changes, and your website’s performance for individual metrics.As always, you can click into any chart to see more details.Remember that to see CWV data, you’ll need to head into your Site Audit Crawl settings and enable “Retrieve Core Web Vitals” with a valid API key set. Then you’ll need to run a fresh crawl.2. GeneralProject Access Control (for Agency plans and above)If you’re on an Agency or Enterprise plan, you can now manage access for your projects.Just create a new project and you can allow specific users access to your project, share your project with your whole organization, or make it private just for yourself.Now, for existing projects, you can click on this icon on your Dashboard to manage access permissions for each individual project.We’ve also added a new Projects section in Account Settings.From here, your workspace admins can access and manage all workspace projects, including private ones. Plus, with this release, only project owners or workspace admins are allowed to delete projects.How to Use Ahrefs courseThe How to Use Ahrefs course is now live!Learn practical ways to use Ahrefs tools and reports to improve your SEO.
