Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents Google’s constant tinkering with the search results means SEOs have no choice but to stay at the bleeding edge of the latest SEO trends. But, with so many trends, which should you follow, and which should you “no follow?”In this article, I’ll use Ahrefs’ data to find some of the most searched-for SEO trends and share my opinion on whether they’re worth acting on.ContentsSEO trends typically follow a familiar cycle that looks a bit like the Gartner hype cycle.SourceBut, with so many trends to follow, the SEO trends hype cycle looks more like a sine wave, minus the slope of enlightenment or plateau of productivity.Because—let’s face it, it’s so easy to get too caught up in the hype of the next trend, before you’ve even finished with the last one.With so many trends to consider, it’s a good idea to sense-check them before we commit.We can do this by plugging them into Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer to see the forecasted organic search trend data for each keyword. Forecasted search volume is a new feature we’ve added to Ahrefs, you can use it for any keyword, but I think it’s great for spotting upcoming trends.Forecasting search volumes is about to be released in @ahrefs 🔥 pic.twitter.com/EkbOIWa09b— Tim Soulo 🇺🇦 (@timsoulo) March 6, 2024 Sidenote. Search volume doesn’t always tell us the whole story when it comes to SEO trends, but it can help you make a decision on whether a trend is worth following or not.1. “Links are less important”If you’ve been working in SEO for a while, you’ll know that links are generally considered one of the most important Google ranking factors.So, it may surprise you that Googler Gary Illyes recently said, “Over the years, we’ve made links less important” at a Bulgarian search conference recently.“We need very few links to rank pages… Over the years we’ve made links less important.” @methode #serpconf2024— Patrick Stox (@patrickstox) April 19, 2024 So are links less important? And should you focus on other things rather than link building? Let’s see what the data says.Ahrefs data shows people are still searching for link building, and the forecasted trend is stable.Of course, we’ll never know exactly how Google is weighting its algorithm, but it seems clear that link building is still a popular monthly search with a stable forecasted trend.Should you follow? — NoIt may be true that links are marginally less important than they were before, but if you look at any SERP using an SEO tool like Ahrefs, it’s clear that one of the most commonly shared signals of top-performing websites is links.(And if you still aren’t convinced, please send your backlinks to Tim Soulo.)If anyone doesn’t need their backlinks - please DM me… I’ll gladly take over some of them 🙂 https://t.co/e1DMFqaruQ— Tim Soulo 🇺🇦 (@timsoulo) April 24, 2024 To get started with link building, check out our link building guide on the blog and the Ahrefs’ Academy to learn how to build links for your business.Further readingLink Building: Beginner’s Guide9 Easy Link Building Strategies (That Anyone Can Use)Advanced Link Building Course2. Video SEOWith more people than ever before consuming content in video format, video SEO is hard to ignore now.Platforms like YouTube and TikTok are the homes of most video content, and searchers’ want to know how to do SEO for these specific platforms.The trend for all three search terms looks very steady.Video SEO:YouTube SEO:TikTok SEO:Both platforms have a steady forecasted trend.Should you follow? — YesIt should come as no surprise that creating video content can be a useful way to generate more interest in your website and business.At Ahrefs, we take video content seriously, and we’ve built the most popular YouTube SEO channels on YouTube.We also have the Ahrefs Academy, which helps people understand SEO and how to use our products.Further readingYouTube Videos: How to Rank Your Videos From Start to FinishVideo SEO: How to rank YouTube Videos on Google3. Voice searchAs SEO trends go, this one is a whopper. Did you find this article using Google’s voice search?Be honest…Ha! Probably not. But despite this, every few years or so, voice search comes back into the foreground, and people once again buy into the hype. The latest example is following ChatGPT announcing their new voice capabilities.Looking at this search trend using Ahrefs’ data it shows that although it has a reasonable amount of search volume, it’s been on a downward trend for a while.Should you follow? — NoOptimizing your business for voice search is not worth the effort. And even for this shop below that went the whole hog, it’s more of a PR stunt than an actual viable SEO strategy.I even asked on LinkedIn in a quick straw poll to see how often people used voice search.The result was fairly conclusive:So in conclusion, I’d say there’s little point investing time and energy into an SEO trend that’s not straightforward to optimize for.Further readingVoice Search — A No-Nonsense Guide4. Core Web VitalsCore Web Vitals (CWVs) are metrics created by Google to measure the user experience of your website.By improving them, you provide a better experience for your visitors, and Google may rank your website higher as a result.Judging by the search trend data, interest in CWVs has plateaued a little, following the peak of inflated expectations.Should you follow? — It dependsCore Web Vitals are useful for benchmarking your website’s user experience metrics, and we have added the ability to pull them using our Site Audit tool.But I think they can be overstated in importance sometimes, and it’s easy to get obsessed with getting the perfect scores.I have said “it depends” here because I believe there is more value in improving Core Web Vitals with enterprise websites than with smaller websites.If you want to get started with CWVs, check out our resources below.Further readingWhat are Core Web Vitals and how to improve them?Core Web Vitals: How To Optimize Them for SEO?What is Cumulative Layout Shift and how to improve it?What is Largest Contentful Paint, and how to improve it? 5. SGE – Now “AI Overview”SGE (Search Generative Experience) is Google’s answer to ChatGPT. It sits at the top of the search results and provides generative answers to your search queries.This is what it looks like—in this example, it’s sitting above the featured snippet.Using Ahrefs data, we can see interest in this topic is set to increase over the next few months.Sidenote. It’s worth noting that in this example, the SGE trend has been consistent since 2015, whereas we know the SEO use of it is recent. This suggests that there are other variations of SGE, like the one below. Always check the SERP if you are in any doubt.Should you follow? — YesSGE (Now AI Overview) is featured snippets on steroids. Google says there’s nothing special you have to do to appear in the AI overview apart from following their search essentials guidelines. Definitely one to watch, but the trend will likely switch from “SGE” to “AI Overviews”.Further readingHow to Stand Out in an Ocean of AI ContentAI Overviews and Your Website6. AI SEOSince ChatGPT and other AI tools came on the scene, incorporating AI into traditional SEO processes has become second nature to many SEOs.So why wouldn’t you use tools that help improve efficiency and save time?Using Ahrefs’ data, we can see that searches for AI SEO are forecasted to be a relatively steady trend over the next few months.Should you follow? — YesI think it’s fair to say that AI isn’t going away anytime soon.So, if you’re an AI Luddite, get skilled now in using AI for SEO to increase your efficiency.If you’re not sure where to start, use our blog articles to help level up your AI SEO game:Further reading14 Ways to Use AI for Better, Faster SEOHow to visualize Ahrefs Data with ChatGPTHow to use Ahrefs and ChatGPT to improve your SEO7. EEATEEAT stands for experience, expertise, authority, and trustworthiness. Google says that it uses EEAT signals to understand the credibility of pages on your website.Looking at the search trend data, it looks as though this particular trend is forecasted to slowly increase in the next few months.Should you follow? — It dependsThere’s no shortage of websites that have completely ignored EEAT and have ranked well. But for most websites out there, I think it’s easiest to think of EEAT as managing your reputation, as James Brockbank has said:Thinking about E-E-A-T like your reputation also makes it easier to understand some of the confusing things about the concept… - It’s easy to understand why reputation isn’t a direct ranking factor— James Brockbank (@BrockbankJames) April 30, 2024 Further readingE-E-A-T is the new E-A-T. What the new “E” means for SEO8. Programmatic SEOProgrammatic SEO is the process of creating keyword targeted pages at scale in a near or fully automated way.SEOs have been creating pages at scale for many years, but this has become the latest way to describe this trend.Using Ahrefs, we can see that the search term is forecasted to trend upward over the next few months. So, should you follow it?Should you follow? — It dependsProgrammatic SEO done right can be a valuable asset for your business. But done poorly, it can appear low quality and spammy and negatively impact your brand’s reputation.Google’s John Mueller went as far as to say that programmatic SEO can sometimes be a “fancy banner for spam.”On the Ahrefs’ blog, our Director of Content Marketing, Ryan Law has written about how big companies like Wise and Zapier are using programmatic SEO successfully as part of their SEO strategy—in short, programmatic SEO can be really useful for established websites to create a consistent experience across a certain topic.And, even at Ahrefs, we’ve dabbled in using programmatic SEO to create pages like our /seo/for/ pages—with favorable results so far.So, before you invest time and money into your next programmatic SEO project, ensure that you’ve researched it properly using tools like Keywords Explorer to identify keyword patterns you can use.Further readingProgrammatic SEO. Explained for Beginners9. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is a framework developed by Google to improve the performance and user experience of web pages on mobile devices. It’s been fairly controversial with SEOs to say the least.Most famously, Barry Adams declared that “Google AMP can go to hell,” but even after that, it still took a hell of a long while to watch the slow-motion death of AMP—and it’s not even over yet.Should you follow? — NoIn my opinion, AMP has had its day a long time ago.And if you need any more proof, even the friendly team at Wix has recently decided to “kill it with fire.”6 months ago, I wrote an opinion piece for the @Wix #SEO hub reconsidering the benefits of using AMP. Starting August 1st, we will be sunsetting AMP and will 301 redirect the AMP URLs to their corresponding blog posts.It is time to kill it with fire 🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/gYIxLlVnoG— Nati Elimelech (@Netanel) May 8, 2024 Further readingWhat are Accelerated Mobile Pages?10. Information gainInformation gain is Google’s patented way to assign a score to your content that determines how unique it is compared to other content on that topic.The easiest way to provide information gain is to write about your personal experience and bring your own unique perspective to your writingAhrefs’ data shows that this trend, although often discussed on social media, is barely on the radar in terms of Search volume. So, should you follow it?Should you follow? — YesOk, I know what you’re thinking. Why follow a trend that’s on a decline? The reason is that the term “information gain” was used outside of SEO.At Ahrefs’ we’ve spent a lot of time revamping our content process to provide more unique value for our readers that separates us from our competitor’s content.Whenever we create content, we try to provide extra value for our readers by:Running surveysConducting data studiesSourcing expert quotesCreating unique illustrations and diagrams to break down complex conceptsIntegrating video content into our written contentGoing the extra mile with your content is no easy task—but is it worth it? The main reason we do it is to create a better experience and lasting impression for people using the Ahrefs website. We believe that this is what drives sales and builds our brand.Based on a recent interview with Sundar Pichai, this challenge seems to be top of their minds at the moment:“How do you reward originality, creativity, and independent voice at whatever scale at which you’re able to and give a chance for that to thrive in this content ecosystem we create? That’s what I think about. That’s what the Search team thinks about.”Sundar Pichai, CEO, GoogleFurther readingHow “Deep Content” Will Protect Your SEO in the AI EraFinal thoughtsUnderstanding which SEO trends are worth your time and effort may seem like a bit of a gamble without data to back it up.However, armed with Ahrefs’ search volume forecasting feature, you can get a better idea of the longer-term prospects for any keyword and understand what stage of the SEO hype cycle the trend may be in. This allows you to make a more informed business decision about whether a trend is worth following or not.Got questions? Ping me on X.
