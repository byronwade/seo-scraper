Oversubscribed: How to Get People Lining Up to Do Business with YouAuthor: Daniel PriestleyFirst published: 2015Recommended by: Joshua HardwickHere’s why Joshua recommends this book:“It’s one of those books where the lessons seem obvious in hindsight. You’re reading it thinking “ohhh…. Obviously! Why didn’t I think of that before.”For example, one of the key lessons is that you need to know your business’s capacity (how many clients/customers you can serve), then create more demand for your offering than that. In this way, you will always be ‘oversubscribed’ and will be able to pick and choose who you want to work with. It also gives super actionable advice rather than theoretical mumbo jumbo. Daniel literally explains how to build demand for your business in ways you can actually put into practice.”Joshua Hardwick, Senior Content Marketer, Ahrefs2. Influence: The Psychology of PersuasionAuthor: Robert B. CialdiniFirst published: 1984Recommended by: Ryan Law, Nick ChurickHere’s why Ryan and Nick recommend this book:“I think ‘persuasion’ is the ultimate goal of everything we do in content marketing. We want people to believe in our opinions, trust in our judgment, and assume that the methods and processes we share actually work. However, most content marketers are scared to actively persuade people and to try to advocate for their ideas. They end up usually just dumping rote information on the page in a take-it-or-leave-it kind of way.Influence is a classic for a very good reason: It talks through six different tools in the persuasion toolkit (reciprocity, scarcity, authority, commitment and consistency, liking, and consensus) and shows how real people apply them in everyday life. It’s very easy to turn the book’s ideas into better marketing.”Ryan Law, Director of Content Marketing, Ahrefs“Because marketing equals understanding people, predicting their behavior and influencing it, which is basically psychology.”Nick Churick, Product Marketer, Ahrefs3. Perennial Seller: The Art of Making and Marketing Work that LastsAuthor: Ryan HolidayFirst published: 2017Recommended by: Tim SouloHere’s why Tim recommends this book:“Perennial Seller explains what it takes to create notable work that will stand the test of time. Instead of giving readers any tricks, hacks, or loopholes to exploit, it highlights the importance of fundamentals like doing hard things, understanding your audience, building a dedicated following, developing relationships, and more.”Tim Soulo, Chief Marketing Officer, Ahrefs4. Demand-Side Sales 101: Stop Selling and Help Your Customers Make ProgressAuthor: Bob Moesta, Greg EngleFirst published: 2020Recommended by: Audrey LiuHere’s why Audrey recommends this book:“⁠Marketing fundamentally is about connecting the product to users and helping them transform and reach their ideal state. This book provides a framework on how to go about mapping your customer journey, from first thought, passive looking to actively looking, deciding and buying. And the push and pull people experience when they’re buying.”Audrey Liu, Content Strategist, Organic Growth, Thomson X5. Playing to Win: How Strategy Really WorksAuthor: A.G. Lafley, Roger L. MartinFirst published: 2013Recommended by: Ruoshan TaoHere’s why Ruoshan recommends this book:“This book changed my life. It was the first thing that I read which properly clarified my thinking on strategy. It’s a super simple framework that’s applicable to most businesses, written in a layman-friendly way. I also liked a lot of the examples, which were entertaining to read. It also wasn’t annoyingly repetitive like a lot of other business books.”Ruoshan Tao, Head of Marketing, SEA & LatAm, Canva6. Web Copy That Sells: The Revolutionary Formula for Creating Killer Copy Every TimeAuthor: Maria VelosoFirst published: 2013Recommended by: Despina GavoyannisHere’s why Despina recommends this book:“Copywriting skills are the foundation of all marketing. No matter what platform or channel you’re marketing on, the words you use matter. This book gives you the fundamentals needed to make an impact with content.”Despina Gavoyannis, Senior SEO Specialist, Ahrefs7. Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted WorldAuthor: Cal NewportFirst published: 2016Recommended by: Chris HainesHere’s why Chris recommends this book:“The marketing world can be a noisy environment. This book reminded me that to cut through the noise, you need to practice “deep work” and focus on creating work that can’t easily be created if you want to stand out. I applied this to a number of my posts at Ahrefs and started running more polls on social media and interviewing people to get more unique and original insights from the SEO community.I feel this book is relevant for marketers, because we can easily get distracted by the latest shiny thing and lose sight of the big picture of what we’re working on. This book is a reminder to focus on the things that matter.”Chris Haines, Senior SEO Specialist, Ahrefs8. The 5 Gears: How to Be Present and Productive When There is Never Enough TimeAuthor: Jeremie Kubicek, Steve CockramFirst published: 2015Recommended by: Robert Lai (Chief Executive Officer, Kaliber)Here’s why Robert recommends this book:“I recommend this book because it walks you through the reasons why at times we’re not as effective as we’d like to be and how some of our practices may be taking us further away from our targets, despite working extremely hard towards them.Similar to a car, our 5th gear is where we find ourselves working 100km/hour. However, when driving at that speed, we miss the small details. Those small details as it relates to things like performance marketing could be qualitative details of our campaigns or zooming in too closely to our cost per leads, as opposed to assessing the other promising benefits like driving awareness.Working in high gear doesn’t allow us to be creative or think qualitatively, which are also important aspects of an effective marketer. Manage your mind and you’ll extract more from your days!”Robert Lai, Chief Executive Officer, Kaliber9. Positioning: The Battle for Your MindAuthor: Al Ries, Jack TroutFirst published: 1980Recommended by: Andrei Țiț, Mateusz MakosiewiczHere’s why Andrei and Mateusz recommend this book:“This is a mandatory read for product marketers. First principles type of book. Positioning is winning a place in the customer’s mind, which is often portrayed as a “ladder”. Conversely, the opposite is true. Positioning is a zero-sum game, where one known brand needs to get out of the “mind ladder” for a new one to get in.”Andrei Țiț, Product Marketer, Ahrefs“If marketing is about one thing, it’s about perception, and this book is perception management 101.”Mateusz Makosiewicz, Content Marketer, Ahrefs10. Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t KnowAuthor: Adam GrantFirst published: 2021Recommended by: Delbert Ty Here’s why Delbert recommends this book:“Great book in helping you question existing biases. As a marketer, you should always question and think like a scientist running experiments. It’s easy to get stuck in a certain way of thinking because that’s how it’s always been. As a scientist, you approach things with intellectual honesty and curiosity. That’s how you accrue knowledge as a marketer.”Delbert Ty, Chief Marketing Officer, Coffee Meets Bagel11. Measure What Matters: The Simple Idea that Drives 10x GrowthAuthor: John DoerrFirst published: 2018Recommended by: Erik SarisskyHere’s why Erik recommends this book:“I have a feeling that most self-help marketing books tend to be very theoretical and recycle the same theory. This book contains good case studies, provides clarity, and shows how to set effective OKRs without BS.”Erik Sarissky, Head of International Marketing and Product Localization, Ahrefs12. Intercom on Marketing: The Marketing Book for StartupsAuthor: Des Traynor, John CollinsFirst published: 2018Recommended by: Igor GorbenkoHere’s why Igor recommends this book:“I respect Intercom as a company. They make great products and are 100% worth learning from. This book is basically their marketing playbook that anyone can take and adapt to their business. It was an easy read, well-paced, and supported by visuals where necessary. Great way to introduce tech founders to marketing processes.”Igor Gorbenko, Partnerships Manager, Ahrefs13. How to Lie with StatisticsAuthor: Darrell HuffFirst published: 1954Recommended by: Ashwin BalakrishnanHere’s why Ashwin recommends this book:“Our world is one where data is everywhere but data literacy is in short supply. I call it the twofold curse of the modern marketer. We’ve become so reliant on data to inform our opinions and decisions that we trust numbers at face value. We’ve forgotten what it actually means to “trust your gut” in marketing.Huff’s book explains how data and data visualization can be used to misrepresent facts or support a predetermined argument, shows you what that looks like so you can “trust your gut” when you recognize it in the wild, and tells you how to go about using data with more honesty.One might say it’s more relevant today than when it was first published in the 1950s.Ashwin Balakrishnan, Head of Marketing, Optmyzr14. Blink: The Power of Thinking Without ThinkingAuthor: Malcolm GladwellFirst published: 2005Recommended by: Louise LinehanHere’s why Louise recommends this book:“Blink made me think a lot more about the psychology of the audiences I create content for, but also about the ways in which I interpret my own audience. The main concept that stood out was “thin-slicing”, or the idea that often, decisions made quickly can be just as accurate as those made methodically and deliberately.I thought about that specifically in relation to attribution, since I would spend a lot of time and effort trying to piece together the impact of my content throughout the customer’s journey. It was probably the first time I had an “anti-attribution” thought, i.e. my existing knowledge and intuition could have allowed me to draw the same conclusions in half the time.I also practice “thin-slicing” when I come to write about a new topic. I often find my clearest thoughts and best ideas come at the very beginning, before I get too into the “weeds” of researching and writing. I’ve learned to pay attention to those initial instincts and make sure I take notes. They’re always super useful to come back to when I’ve got ‘too close to the problem.’”Louise Linehan, Content Marketer, Ahrefs15. The 1-Page Marketing Plan: Get New Customers, Make More Money, And Stand out From The CrowdAuthor: Allan DibFirst published: 2016Recommended by: Michelle LindnerHere’s why Michelle recommends this book:“I recommend this book to anyone in business. It’s probably too basic for advanced marketers, but it’s always good to revisit the fundamentals that don’t change. Despite the title, it’s not full of the gimmicky bullshit and “innovative” terms that don’t actually mean anything.”Michelle Lindner, Community Manager, Ahrefs16. Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being RemarkableAuthor: Seth GodinFirst published: 2003Recommended by: Elysa HanHere’s why Elysa recommends this book:“Clear and practical content, which naturally makes me pause, think, and reflect. In this regard, it helps me grasp his concepts and messages a whole lot better.Case studies are really helpful to put things into perspective, so it’s worth pointing out that Godin included a number of these. In a nutshell, he emphasizes for marketers (or even humans in general) to never be stagnant. Stay curious, adaptable, and when there are things to be done, ideas to be executed, just do it.This is really a mindset thing for me that will probably stay relevant, and serve as a reminder for a long time to come.”Elysa Han, Marketing Events Executive, Ahrefs17. Negotiation Genius: How to Overcome Obstacles and Achieve Brilliant Results at the Bargaining Table and BeyondAuthor: Deepak Malhotra, Max BazermanFirst published: 2007Recommended by: Daria SamokishHere’s why Daria recommends this book:“This book is for people who love learning through stories and real-life examples. With this book, you can figure out the basics of negotiation through the smart moves of people who have made decisions in real-world negotiations.It was personally amazing to learn how people turned hopeless situations into benefits, navigated crises by finding an unobvious common ground, or managed good deals with people playing hardball. On top of amusement, it adds insights into your own psychological biases and perceptions of other people to help you build a mindset for negotiations as a tool for everyday life, not only for business. After reading it, I secured my first deal that saved me the third part of the budget.”Daria Samokish, Head of PR, Ahrefs18. The Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things RightAuthor: Atul GawandeFirst published: 2009Recommended by: Constance TanHere’s why Constance recommends this book:“I’m a huge fan of this book as it was instrumental in helping me focus on tasks that actually make an impact, and putting in a process that consistently brings results as a team.”Constance Tan, Product Marketer, Ahrefs19. Stories That Stick: How Storytelling Can Captivate Customers, Influence Audiences, and Transform Your BusinessAuthor: Kindra HallFirst published: 2019Recommended by: Sam OhHere’s why Sam recommends this book:“This book gave me a starting point to kickstart how to go about learning about storytelling. But if I’m being 100% honest, I feel I learned most in the past year by just trying and doing things.”Sam Oh, VP Marketing, Ahrefs20. How to Win Friends and Influence PeopleAuthor: Dale CarnegieFirst published: 2019Recommended by: Patrick StoxHere’s why Patrick recommends this book:“Marketing is just another form of sales. Building relationships help with sales and getting buy-in for marketing ideas.”Patrick Stox, Product Advisor, Technical SEO, and Brand Ambassador, Ahrefs21. What It IsAuthor: Lynda BarryFirst published: 2008Recommended by: Rebekah BekHere’s why Rebekah recommends this book:“I’d peg this book as more of a … writing/creative prompt or guide? I like it exactly because it defies definition while helping me to stop self-censoring and pay attention to and channel my inner thoughts. It reminds me that creative things can speak to the heart and that you should find the story already inside of you to tell.”Rebekah Bek, Product Marketer, Ahrefs22. The Culture Map: Decoding How People Think, Lead, and Get Things Done Across CulturesAuthor: Erin MeyerFirst published: 2008Recommended by: Lin GweeHere’s why Lin Gwee recommends this book:“Really helps marketers in thinking about cultural nuances and crafting messaging/campaigns that resonate, especially for regional marketers!”Lin Gwee, Senior Marketing Manager, HubSpot23. Building a StoryBrand: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will ListenAuthor: Donald MillerFirst published: 2017Recommended by: Amy KimHere’s why Amy recommend this book:“With the cookie-less era, a branded website is more important than ever. Creating inbound traffic will be important, but the more crucial thing is to hold and grab the customer’s attention on your webpage. This book was very helpful in showing me how to make an impactful storyline for any website.”Amy Kim, Founder & CEO, Elifunt24. The Boron LettersAuthor: Gary HalbertFirst published: 2013Recommended by: Me!Here’s why I recommend this book:“Copywriting, or writing itself, is a fundamental skill of digital marketing. It underlies everything, from ad copy to content, from video scripts to social media. I was lucky enough to chance upon this book when I wanted to learn copywriting.This book isn’t really a book, but a series of letters from the well-regarded copywriter Gary Halbert to his son Bond Halbert. But within it lies all the copywriting lessons, tips, and strategies you need. In fact, one of the major lessons I remember—and it’s still a much-recommended tip today by other famous copywriters, including Sam Parr of The Hustle—was to handcopy famous ads and sales letters. Which I took to heart: I copied by hand every single issue of the Boron Letters. I personally think the one or two months I took to do this skyrocketed my writing skills like no other method.”Si Quan Ong, Senior Content Marketer, AhrefsFinal thoughtsRory Sutherland, Vice Chairman at Ogilvy Group, once tweeted:Jeremy Bullmore: “The best books to read on advertising aren’t about advertising.”— Rory Sutherland (@rorysutherland) July 15, 2020 You can see it’s true—most of the recommended books here are barely about marketing. Instead, they’re about something else—business, productivity, storytelling, psychology, and statistics.If you broaden your perspective, you might find some cool ideas from elsewhere you can apply too.Did I miss any books?
