Ariana Grande, Eminem, and Taylor Swift also make it into the top 40 with almost three million combined searches.And this song is proving pretty popular, with over 2.5M monthly searches:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7qovpFAGrQBut it‚Äôs not all about music‚Ä¶You‚Äôll notice that 5 of the top 10 searches are ‚Äúbranded‚Äù searches‚Äîi.e., folks searching for channel names or YouTube personalities. This is a trend that continues beyond the top 10, with 52% of the top 100 searches being for specific YouTube personalities and channels.Here are the top 10 most popular YouTube channels and ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù according to our data:#KeywordSearch Volume1pewdiepie4,571,3982markiplier2,969,2673pewdiepie vs t series2,179,5974david dobrik2,006,2635jacksepticeye1,956,4986joe rogan1,922,6197james charles1,852,0578dantdm1,648,3799snl1,569,45210game grumps1,399,182These searches get a combined 22.7 MILLION searches per month in the US.Interestingly, quite a few of these folks are gaming vloggers (or gaming vloggers turned YouTube personalities, like PewDiePie), which brings us neatly onto what appears to be the next most popular genre of videos on YouTube: gaming videos.Here are all the searches that somehow relate to gaming (and their respective search volumes):#KeywordSearch Volume1pewdiepie4,571,3982markiplier2,969,2673fortnite2,010,8344jacksepticeye1,956,4985dantdm1,648,3796game grumps1,399,1827minecraft1,294,9208fgteev1,132,1399ssundee1,130,35610vanossgaming888,35711unspeakable794,40312dunkey706,01013game theory693,33414popularmmos679,44215borderlands 3670,49416ninja670,41317pokemon sword and shield640,84618nintendo620,470Having looked through some of those channels myself, live gaming videos‚Äîaka, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs plays‚Äù‚Äîseem very popular.

But what is surprising is this:None of the top 100 YouTube searches in the US have anything to do with cats.

Searches for artists, bands and songs dominate our list of the top 100 worldwide YouTube searches with a staggering 58/100 searches (almost ‚Öî) being music-related.So compared to the US, it seems that the rest of the World uses YouTube far more for music.What are they listening to besides BTS? Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, Coldplay, and of course,Billie Eilish.Here‚Äôs a great live performance by Billie:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sZ2_aGsLKUThere are also far fewer ‚Äúbranded‚Äù searches (i.e., for YouTube personalities) Worldwide. Only two of the top 10 searches are branded, which is quite a contrast to the US where half the top 10 searches are.ASMR videos appear to be popular everywhere.Not familiar with ASMR videos either?
