But behind the low cost lies a set of significant risks and downsides - with a potential permanent ban topping the list.Here’s what you need to know before diving in.What you get with an Ahrefs group buyLots of risks, really. You might not realize it, but here are all the things that are likely to come bundled with any group buy account:Permanent account bans – Finally got into your account? Be warned: group buys violate our official terms, and we reserve the right to permanently ban such accounts at any moment.Unclear instructions – You never quite know how to activate your account, or what you’re actually getting.No refunds – Many group buys also don’t offer refunds in any form, and explicitly mention this in their terms and conditions.No official support and accountability – When things break (and they will), you’re on your own with no support available.Harsh limitations – Plenty of these group buys implement limitations that are much harsher than the allowances on our official plans.Strange terms and conditions – It’s not uncommon for group buys to request information like your Facebook Profile and Skype ID.Limited access to tools – You’re locked out of some of the most essential Ahrefs tools.That’s just a taster of all the things that could go wrong, especially when you can get something else for the same price…What’s better than an Ahrefs group buy?Why take all the risks above when you can get Ahrefs’ official Starter plan for just $29/month? 😉Our Starter plan gives you a full introduction to Ahrefs’ toolset, with none of the risks and limitations of a group buy account.Fun fact$29/month is actually less than what many group buys are asking.
