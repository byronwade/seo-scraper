Conversion tools (converting from PDF to Word Doc, from JPG to PDF, and so on) drive the majority of the site‚Äôs traffic:These free tools target extremely high volume keywords, like pdf to word with an estimated 3.9M searches in Indonesia alone. Here‚Äôs the actual page that ranks so well:These tools have also been localized to different languages, with the Spanish-, Indonesian- and Portuguese-targeted subfolders generating a large portion of the website‚Äôs traffic growth:2.
