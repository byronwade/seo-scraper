Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents According to Aira‚Äôs State of Link Building report, guest blogging is the third most popular link building strategy, with 47% of surveyed SEOs using it as their go-to. Not only is guest posting well and alive, it‚Äôs still highly effective. In this post, you‚Äôll learn everything you need to know about guest blogging. But first, let‚Äôs make sure we‚Äôre on the same page.ContentsWhat is guest blogging?Guest blogging is the practice of writing and publishing a blog post on another person or company‚Äôs website. Most guest bloggers receive credit for their post (and a link to their website) in their author byline.For example, I wrote a guest post for Grow & Convert several years ago:What are the benefits of guest blogging?Guest blogging is a win-win for both the guest blogger and the blog owner.Benefits for the writer:Build links back to their own blog or siteDevelop relationships with editors and blog ownersExpose their brand to a new audienceBuild their reputation and position themselves as a thought leaderBenefit for the site owner:Leverage the expertise and experience of guest bloggers. For example, we published guest posts from Zapier and Pet Keen. We couldn‚Äôt have written about their firsthand SEO experience without guest writers.How to start guest bloggingGetting your first guest post published can be daunting. I‚Äôve been there. The steps below will make the process easier and maximize your chances of success.Follow this guest blogging strategy:1. Find guest blogging opportunitiesTo find guest posting opportunities, most people use Google search operators to find blogs with ‚Äúwrite for us‚Äù pages. However, if everyone‚Äôs following this tactic, then everyone‚Äôs finding the same opportunities. Competition will be rife, and guest blogs may ignore your pitch. You don‚Äôt have to limit yourself to this small pool of blogs. Even if they do not advertise it, most blogs will accept guest posts as long as it‚Äôs a wonderful article.So here‚Äôs how to find relevant, high quality sites to pitch:Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Content ExplorerEnter a broad keyword or phrase related to your nicheSelect In title from the drop-down menuRun the searchHere, you can see more than 2 million potential opportunities. That‚Äôs too many, so let‚Äôs narrow the list down by applying these filters:Domain Rating (DR) from 30 to 60Click the One page per domain filterClick the Exclude homepages filterClick the Exclude subdomains filterThen click on the Websites tab. These are the potential websites you could guest blog for.2. Develop guest post ideasThe blogs you pitch will want winning content ideas. So how can you come up with good guest post ideas? Here are some techniques you can use:Copycat TechniqueThree things are true:Every blog wants more search traffic.To get search traffic, you need to do keyword research and target topics people are searching for.Every blog has more topics to write than resources to cover them.So why not help your target blogs out? Find topics they should be ranking for and pitch them those topics.Here‚Äôs how to find them:Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Competitive Analysis toolEnter the domain of your target blog in the Target sectionAdd the first three suggested competing domains in the Competitors sectionClick CompareThis report shows you the keywords the competing domains are ranking for, but your target blog isn‚Äôt. Go through the report and look for keywords that are relevant to your target blog. For example, this seems like a potential topic to pitch:Refresh TechniqueRefreshing outdated content can provide a huge traffic boost, as seen when we updated our post about free SEO tools:Your target blog will likely have outdated content that has declined in search traffic. Pitch them an update.What if.. ..instead of reaching out with an offer to write a guest post for someone‚Ä¶..you would find their old and outdated post that dipped in search traffic and offer them to rewrite it?ü§î‚Äî Tim Soulo üá∫üá¶ (@timsoulo) August 13, 2019 Here‚Äôs how to find pages with declining traffic:Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Site ExplorerEnter the domain of your target blogGo to the Top pages reportSet the Compare filter to Previous yearSort the Traffic change column from lowest to highestThis will show you pages on your target blog that have the largest decline in search traffic since the previous year. Go through the report and look out for suitable topics, especially those with declines in traffic and keyword positions.For example, SmartBlogger‚Äôs post on membership sites has dropped in both keyword positions and search traffic:If you were writing for SmartBlogger, this would be a good topic to pitch.Further readingRepublishing Content: How to Update Old Blog Posts for SEO Robin Hood TechniquePopular blogs are popular for one reason: They have great content. Lesser-known blogs are lesser-known for the opposite reason: They have yet to publish tons of great content.So why not take content ideas from the top blogs and offer them to lesser-known ones? We call this the Robin Hood Technique, named after the English folk hero who stole from the rich and gave to the poor.Here‚Äôs how to execute the Robin Hood Technique:Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Site ExplorerEnter the domain of a high-DR blog in your nicheGo to the Top pages reportToggle SERP titles onLook through the report and see if there is any idea that resonates. Put a unique spin and pitch it to a lesser-known blog.For example, if you‚Äôre writing for a personal finance blog, this seems like a good topic to be inspired by:A potential idea to pitch can be ‚Äúfree (or cheap) things to do on a date.‚ÄùSplintering TechniqueOur link building guide is so comprehensive it spans five chapters:Each chapter could be a post on its own. So we can break this post into ‚Äúsplinters‚Äù and create standalone articles. Each of these splintered articles can be pitched as a guest post.Since we already did the research by creating the original piece, the ‚Äúsplintered‚Äù articles would likely not take much time to write. Perspective TechniqueYou can easily reuse a topic by switching up the perspective. For example, let‚Äôs say we wrote a guest post titled ‚ÄúBest Remote Jobs for Students.‚Äù We can cover the same topic for different publications via multiple perspectives:3. Pitch the blogsThis step is both the easiest and the most nerve-wracking. It‚Äôs easy because it‚Äôs simply an email you send. It‚Äôs nerve-wracking because your fate is in the other party‚Äôs hands.It doesn‚Äôt have to be that anxiety-inducing, though. Here are some tips to improve your chances of getting your pitch accepted:Read the guest posting guidelinesIf the site you‚Äôre pitching has a guest post submission page, read and follow the blog‚Äôs guest post guidelines. For example, this is what CoSchedule expects:Find the correct emailIf the publication has a ‚Äúwrite for us‚Äù page, then it‚Äôs likely it‚Äôll provide either an email address or a form. Otherwise, you‚Äôll need to find it.Publications and blogs are typically managed by a managing editor, head of content or, if they‚Äôre a small site, the website owner themself. So you want to first make sure you identify who that person is. You can usually find them by visiting the ‚Äúteams‚Äù or ‚Äúabout‚Äù page. For example, a quick scroll on our ‚Äúteam‚Äù page shows you should pitch to our head of content, Joshua Hardwick:If the ‚Äúteam‚Äù page is uninformative, then a search on LinkedIn or Twitter usually suffices.Once you‚Äôve identified that person, use an email discovery tool like Hunter to find their email. Add their name and website, and Hunter will do its magic:Further reading6 Proven Ways to Find Anyone‚Äôs Email Address Write an amazing outreach emailSeveral years ago, I guest posted for Grow & Convert.

You‚Äôd also do well to read the post below and follow the principles it lays out.Further readingI Just Deleted Your Outreach Email Without Reading. And NO, I Don‚Äôt Feel Sorry. 4. Write your guest postIf your pitch is accepted, then it‚Äôs time to write.I recommend starting first with the outline. Some sites may request this. But even if they don‚Äôt, an outline will help flesh out your thoughts, organize the post, and prevent blank page syndrome. To create an outline, you need to know what subtopics to cover. The easiest way to find these subtopics is to look at the common keyword rankings among top-ranking pages and eyeball the list for subtopics.Here‚Äôs how:Enter your target keyword into Ahrefs‚Äô Keywords ExplorerScroll down to the SERP overviewSelect the top-ranking pages you want to analyzeClick Open in and choose Content gapFor example, if we analyze the topic ‚Äúaffiliate marketing,‚Äù we‚Äôll see that the top-ranking pages also rank for:what is affiliate marketinghow to become an affiliate marketerhow to do affiliate marketingThese would make good H2s for a blog post on ‚Äúaffiliate marketing.‚ÄùOnce you‚Äôve created your outline, all that‚Äôs left is to fill in the ‚Äúgaps,‚Äù i.e., write the guest post. If they have one, make sure you go back to the guidelines, read it carefully, and follow it to a T.Where relevant, don‚Äôt forget to include links back to your own blog. Don‚Äôt overdo it, though; one to two links to your own content should suffice.Further readingContent Writing Explained + 8 Tips to Become a Better Writer How to Write a Blog Post (That People Actually Want to Read) in 9 Steps21 Writing Tips to Become a Better Writer FastSEO Copywriting: What It Is & How to Do It5.

But guest blogging is not a bed of roses. So I‚Äôm sharing the tips below to help you overcome some of the common roadblocks.1. Pitch more blogs than you can handleThe cruel reality of guest blogging is that even if they‚Äôre good, your guest blogging efforts can be rejected or ignored. That‚Äôs no fault of yours‚Äîpublications are just too busy.So here‚Äôs a controversial tip: pitch the same topics to multiple blogs. Then offer the article to whoever replies first or has a higher authority (if you get lots of replies).This way, you‚Äôre never lacking for guest posts. You won‚Äôt even need to be worried about rejection, for there will be another blog willing to accept your guest posts.If you get more than one reply, simply tell the truth:Sorry, you weren‚Äôt responding for a few days, so another blog took this idea. I‚Äôll be in touch with more article ideas that‚Äôll be just as good.2. Write for blogs that have never linked to you beforeOur study of 1 billion pages shows a strong correlation between organic traffic and the number of backlinks from unique websites (referring domains).That may be one reason why you want to write for blogs that have never linked to you before.To find unique websites, hit the Highlight unlinked dropdown and add your website as you‚Äôre following step #1:Guest blogging toolsThese tools will make your guest blogging process more efficient:Ahrefs ‚Äì Research guest post opportunities, find content gaps to pitch blogs, build your outlines, check backlinks from guest posts, and track your guest post rankings.Hunter ‚Äì Find the email addresses of website owners and editors.Pitchbox ‚Äì Send outreach emails at scale.Ahrefs‚Äô free AI writing tools ‚Äì Generate outlines, titles, and proofread your drafts.ChatGPT ‚Äì Generate guest post ideas, create outlines, flesh out guest posts, proofread your work, and more.FAQHere are some frequently asked questions about guest blogging:How does guest blogging help SEO?Links are an important Google ranking factor.
