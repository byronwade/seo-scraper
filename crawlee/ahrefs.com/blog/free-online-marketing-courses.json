Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents We asked Twitter users to recommend their favorite free digital marketing courses and received over a hundred replies:Is there a good FREE digital marketing course that you can recommend?— Tim Soulo 🇺🇦 (@timsoulo) August 17, 2021 Courses from Google’s Digital Garage, HubSpot Academy, and Ahrefs Academy all got a seal of approval. But what else met the mark?To narrow my search, I looked at the:Instructors behind the courses.Ratings and reviews.Level of experience expected of students (beginner, intermediate, expert).Relevance of the course material in today’s marketing landscape.Here are the free digital marketing courses that made the cut:How to Use TikTok for Business by Later.comContext is Key: Social Media Strategy in a Noisy Online WorldInstagram for Business: Build an Engaged Community Blogging for Business by AhrefsSEO Training Course by AhrefsDigital Skills: Digital Marketing by AccentureContent Marketing Certification Course by HubSpotIntroduction to Social Media Advertising by BufferDigital & Social by Twitter Flight SchoolGoogle Ads by SkillshopSEO Training Course by HubSpotHow to Use Instagram Stories (IGS) for Business by Later.comMicrosoft Advertising CertificationEmail Marketing Certification by HubSpotPPC University by WordstreamGoogle Primer: Marketing & MeasurementGoogle Digital Garage: Fundamentals of Digital MarketingBonus: LearningSEO1. How to Use TikTok for Business by Later.comInstructor(s): Taylor LorenTopic: Social media marketingLevel: BeginnerCertification: No Duration: 35 minsAvailable at: Later.comTaylor Loren, the former director of content marketing at Later, leads this short online course that’s guided mostly by her experiences on the popular social media platform.With over 26,000 followers on TikTok, she doles out useful tips you might not have known—like the fact that using trending audio clips or video-editing effects could boost your chances of landing on the For You page.Some things to note: The 35-minute video lesson is essentially a primer into the world of TikTok Business for complete newbies. Having used the short-video platform myself, I’ve found it to be rather intuitive anyway.Still, Taylor’s tips are especially helpful if you’re looking to make full use of the algorithm to expand your reach through eye-catching content and TikTok ads.2. Context is Key: Social Media Strategy in a Noisy Online WorldInstructor(s): Gary VaynerchukTopic: Social media marketingLevel: BeginnerCertification: NoDuration: 1h 31mAvailable at: SkillshareGary Vaynerchuk is the CEO and co-founder of digital social media agency Vaynermedia, and his 2.4 million follower count on Twitter can attest to his success.So it’s no surprise that over 50,000 students have completed this Skillshare course, of which 81% indicated it either exceeded or met their expectations.Spread over 23 video lessons, this course looks at how to develop tailored strategies for social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, as well as tips on building a solid brand narrative.While we think the case studies on Pinterest and Tumblr aren’t particularly relevant today, this course is still worth a shot. You’ll learn some tactics that Gary used to grow major brands like General Electric and PepsiCo.There’s also an optional project involving the creation of a channel-specific social media strategy for a brand of your choice, although this is more for practice since it isn’t graded.Sidenote. This course is free with a Skillshare trial.3. Instagram for Business: Build an Engaged CommunityInstructor(s): Tyler McCallTopic: Social media marketingLevel: BeginnerCertification: NoDuration: 1h 31mAvailable at: SkillshareAs a freelance Instagram marketing strategist, Tyler McCall knows the ins and outs of the platform.In this 13-lesson course, he invites marketers and business owners to relook at the basics of building an engaged community.

To get access to the free content marketing course, you’ll need to set up a HubSpot account.It’s well worth your time, though. I did so in minutes by linking my Google account and answering a few simple questions.The course opens with a foundation on content marketing fundamentals and storytelling tips, followed by 12 lessons on developing a content creation framework and measuring the efficacy of your content.Led by various industry professionals, most of whom are from HubSpot’s marketing team, the course includes multiple quizzes to test your knowledge of the topics covered.At the end, you can opt to take the three-hour exam.

To get started, log in to your Twitter account, and you’ll be all set.If your bigger goal is to score a badge for display on your Twitter and LinkedIn profiles, try the #TwitterFlightSchool Video Badge course instead. It covers video ads on the social media platform.10. Google Ads by SkillshopInstructor(s): N/ATopic: Search engine marketing (SEM)Level: Beginner to intermediateCertification: Yes (Google Ads Certified) Duration: Dependent on your commitment Available at: Skillshop Skillshop by Google is an online academy of sorts that offers courses for some of its major tools, including: Google AdsAnalytics AcademyGoogle Ad ManagerGoogle Marketing PlatformGoogle My Business While Google Ads brands itself as ideal for beginners, we reckon you’ll at least need some working knowledge of SEM to follow the lessons easily.They’re formatted much like the courses on Twitter Flight School, except in greater depth. Start with a pre-self-assessment, then go ahead with checking off each topic, some of which include optional videos to deepen your knowledge.We like that the learning is self-paced. But fair warning: The sheer number of courses (and topics) could leave you feeling overwhelmed, so take your time perusing the lessons before committing to a topic.11.

Through these, you’ll learn how to leverage IGS to grow your business on the social media platform.The course is split into three tracks: design, growth, and strategy, all of which play a crucial role in capturing and retaining Instagram users’ interest. We find the growth track particularly useful; the lessons explain IGS analytics and how to make sense of each metric to improve your Stories strategy.13. Microsoft Advertising CertificationInstructor(s): N/ATopic: SEMLevel: IntermediateCertification: Yes (Microsoft Advertising Certified professional badge and printable certificate)Duration: Dependent on your commitment Available at: Microsoft.comYou’ll be doing far more reading than watching in this text-heavy course, which features a 230-page study guide. Still, we reckon it’s worth your time if you intend to add the badge to your social media platforms, including LinkedIn.The free downloadable includes a checklist of accreditation topics. Among them:Basics of Microsoft Advertising and how pay-per-click advertising worksPPC bidding, traffic estimations, and cost-per-click strategiesBudgeting and billingLinkedIn Profile targetingTo avoid the monotony of pure text, the study guide is supplemented with screenshots from Bing ads, as well as diagrams of fictitious case studies.14. Email Marketing Certification by HubSpotInstructor(s): Courtney Sembler Topic: Email marketingLevel: Beginner to intermediateCertification: Yes Duration: 3h 18mAvailable at: HubSpot AcademyBland, impersonal emails are overdone and ineffective.

Then let Wordstream be your guide. Its PPC University features three guided courses to arm you with the knowledge to do keyword research, participate in Google AdWords auctions, as well as optimize your Google Ads campaigns.As a beginner, I find PPC 101 helpful: There are 11 articles explaining the basics, such as click-through rates and cost per action, as well as a step-by-step guide to setting up your Google Ads account.If you want to go into greater depth, there’s also a 32-page PPC 101 guide to make use of—and it’s free to download upon sign-up.16. Google Primer: Marketing & MeasurementInstructor(s): N/ATopic: Marketing (general)Level: Beginner to advancedCertification: No Duration: N/AAvailable at: YourPrimer.com Google Primer is a free app for business owners and marketers, with five-minute lessons covering digital marketing, measurement, social media, analytics, and more.There are three key tracks for your picking: Business & Operations, Brand & Identity, and Marketing & Measurement.The latter is particularly well rounded and relevant, with 10 overarching topics for both beginners and experienced marketers. Some interesting lessons include crowdsourcing your user testing, making the most of a creative agency, and reaching the right audience through an app campaign.Few courses offer on-the-go lessons in as digestible a format as Google Primer, so we highly recommend it.17. Google Digital Garage: Fundamentals of Digital MarketingInstructor(s): N/ATopic: Marketing (general)Level: BeginnerCertification: YesDuration: 40 hrsAvailable at: Google Digital GarageFor a deep dive into the basics of digital marketing, start with this course that’s accredited by the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe and The Open University. You’ll be introduced to Digital Garage and taught to build and grow your online business strategy over 26 modules.The course also delves into SEO and SEM, mobile advertising, and even building an ecommerce business.Considering how much you’ll stand to learn, a 40-hour course really isn’t such a heavy commitment—especially when you’re free to pace yourself while led by video tutorials and practical exercises.To secure your certification for use on LinkedIn and in your CV, pass the final 40-question exam. Google Digital Garage was also one of the top mentions in our Twitter thread, if we may add.18. Bonus: LearningSEOLearningSEO isn’t a course per se. Rather, it’s an extensive (and regularly updated) repository of resources for anyone looking to boost their SEO knowledge.I like how detailed and organized it is: There are external guides, courses, and videos categorized based on your experience level. It covers SEO basics (measuring and reporting SEO) and even discusses the technicalities of crawl budget optimization and developing SEO contracts.You’re even able to make a (shareable) copy of the SEO list, which comes complete with checkboxes in a color-coded spreadsheet.Final thoughtsCompleting a course takes commitment (I should know!). So if you’re feeling overwhelmed, first consider what gets you excited. If it’s content marketing, start from there. Then, progress to more technical areas you’d like to improve on, such as developing and measuring ad campaigns.All the courses featured here are self-paced too, so take all the time you need to fully grasp each topic. Having a solid foundation truly is key to getting better at digital marketing.Got questions? Ping me on Twitter.
