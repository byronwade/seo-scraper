It’s better suited to founders and entrepreneurs or anyone interested in learning about fresh online business opportunities and revenue models.General marketers may prefer Detailed.com, which includes technical SEO advice, keyword research tactics, plus interesting experiments for further learning.Recommended reading: Affiliate SEO in 2020: A Detailed, 1,000 Keyword AnalysisFollow GlenTwitterFacebook5.
