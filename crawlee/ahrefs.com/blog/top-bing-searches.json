This was also the case with the most popular Google search queries.It‚Äôs clear right away that branded queries dominate this list.A whopping 61% of them revolve around well-known brands and websites.Many of the queries are not only branded but navigational‚Äîi.e., folks using Bing to search for particular websites or login pages.Here are some examples of such queries:#KeywordSearch Volume1facebook log in3,201,6212gmail login1,328,7013ebay official site695,7664yahoo mail login624,879Did you notice the same thing as I did?There are a lot of people trying to access Facebook via Bing.So many, in fact, that Facebook-related queries (e.g., ‚ÄúFacebook,‚Äù Facebook login,‚Äù ‚Äúwww.facebook.com,‚Äù etc.) make up 10.68% of the total search volume from the top 100.You might also have noticed an interesting query in 3rd place‚Äî‚ÄùGoogle.‚ÄùBelieve it or not, there are 8 million monthly US searches for ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù on Bing.That‚Äôs people using one search engine (Bing) to find another (Google).Just in case you‚Äôre one of those people, here‚Äôs a quick trick üòâ -You may also have noticed that there are quite a few queries from seemingly frustrated Windows 10 users looking for help.#KeywordSearch Volume1fix connections to bluetooth audio devices and wireless displays in windows 10805,1832how to get help in windows 10692,540Amazingly, those two searches alone account for 0.94% of all search volume across the top 100.No searches related to Windows 10 (or any version of Windows for that matter) appear on our list of the top 100 Google search queries. So what‚Äôs going on here?This is actually the result of a strange quirk in Windows 10.You see, when you press the F1 key in Windows 10, it opens up your browser window and searches for ‚Äúget help with file explorer in windows 10‚Äù or something similar (it varies depending on the application you‚Äôre using).Long story short, most of these searches are almost certainly accidental.Now let‚Äôs take a look at the top 100 Worldwide Bing searches.Top 100 Bing searches globally#KeywordSearch Volume1google40,958,7572youtube35,279,0423facebook28,550,5374gmail15,868,3345amazon7,854,7526yahoo6,389,3067hotmail6,150,6248open apk file5,987,9409bing homepage quiz5,580,01810bing5,532,57511ebay5,371,42512facebook log in4,888,44613yahoo mail4,604,33314news for you4,428,93615netflix3,949,97316open crdownload file3,636,31617top stories3,623,07318google maps3,448,16719weekly quiz3,137,84820how to get help in windows 102,993,58021you tube2,612,04922gmail login2,555,71723open rar file2,350,07524whatsapp web2,079,78225walmart2,076,55426fix connections to bluetooth audio devices and wireless displays in windows 102,013,70327msn1,893,43828instagram1,876,87429open torrent file1,851,98330google chrome1,836,66331us news1,823,30532open dat file1,823,24233outlook1,822,76334open tmp file1,813,35335le bon coin1,803,94636roblox1,797,88337yt1,795,22738fb1,788,51839open dll file1,787,84840facebook connexion1,783,55841fox news1,731,78442weather1,725,78243get help with file explorer in windows 101,712,15644facebook login1,686,38645bing weekly quiz1,678,37046www.google.com1,671,54047google translate1,659,29548nfl1,611,41749local1,556,61450google.com1,478,07651twitter1,417,90452world1,369,29353sports1,366,09354u.s.1,364,01555amazon.com1,351,90056gmail.com1,334,37257aol1,326,69758pinterest1,314,29459www.facebook.com1,313,68160amazon prime1,286,93861hotmail sign in1,284,99962mlb1,282,78463nba1,279,75864craigslist1,276,07265open pdf file1,270,96866maps1,255,62767open bin file1,245,28168espn1,238,30069g1,236,14770paypal1,192,04871home depot1,176,62672on this day in history1,146,15373translate1,142,67474entertainment1,140,57675open doc file1,125,27576nascar1,086,82477youtube videos1,059,33078wwe1,058,94279science1,037,43380nhl1,036,06381google docs1,018,23182west1,017,47483northeast1,015,85984bbc news1,015,05785south1,004,99286mma1,001,33687soccer995,28088midwest988,50389technology974,18990y958,25391zillow955,54392cfb950,35593wells fargo943,27194africa937,96895hotmail.com931,59896google drive920,31397yahoo mail login918,74898indeed909,04799local news896,385100c√≥mo obtener ayuda en windows 10895,284It‚Äôs not just US users that use Bing to access Google.The most popular Worldwide search query on Bing is ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù‚Äîand by quite a hefty margin too. There are a whopping 40.96M searches for ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù on Bing every month‚Äîthat accounts for 13.2% of all worldwide search volume. Crazy!But the similarities don‚Äôt end there:68% of the top 100 US searches also appear on the worldwide list.Sidenote. The Worldwide list does include all US searches, which may be part of the reason for the significant overlap. Here are a few notable searches that are popular around the world but not in the US:#KeywordSearch Volume1google chrome2,600,0002outlook1,400,0003google search1,020,0004chrome777,0005daily mail729,0006friv710,0007youtube music706,000The most interesting observation here is that people around the world seem to be using Bing to download Google Chrome‚ÄîGoogle‚Äôs web browser.Not only does that mean that many people are unhappy with their current browser‚Äîwhich is likely to be Microsoft Edge if they‚Äôre using Bing‚Äîbut also their current search engine.A fun point here is that Google Chrome defaults to Google search‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ meaning that this will be the last Bing search ever for those people.Should you really care about Bing?Hands up who uses Google as their primary search engine?I‚Äôm sensing a lot of raised hands‚Ä¶ which is hardly surprising.Google has an estimated Worldwide market share of 91.38%. Bing‚Äôs market share is 2.69%.So for every search performed on Bing, roughly 34 searches are conducted on Google.Now, I couldn‚Äôt find any statistics about the number of daily searches on Bing. However, according to internetlivestats.com, 3.5 billion searches are performed on Google every day.If we run a few numbers, we can work out that Bing likely gets around 82.6M searches per day.Sidenote.
