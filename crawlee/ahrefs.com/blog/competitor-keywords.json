They may rank organically or pay for Google Ads to rank in the paid results.Knowing your competitors’ keywords is the easiest form of keyword research. If your competitors rank for or target particular keywords, it might be worth it for you to target them, too.ContentsHow to find your competitors’ organic keywordsThere is no way to see your competitors’ keywords without a tool like Ahrefs, which has a database of keywords and the sites that rank for them. As far as we know, Ahrefs has the biggest database of these keywords.How to find all the keywords your competitor ranks forGo to Ahrefs’ Site ExplorerEnter your competitor’s domainGo to the Organic keywords reportThe report is sorted by traffic to show you the keywords sending your competitor the most visits. For example, Mailchimp gets most of its organic traffic from the keyword “mailchimp.”Since you’re unlikely to rank for your competitor’s brand, you might want to exclude branded keywords from the report. You can do this by adding a Keyword > Doesn’t contain filter. In this example, we’ll filter out keywords containing “mailchimp” or any potential misspellings:If you’re a new brand competing with one that’s established, you might also want to look for popular low-difficulty keywords. You can do this by setting the Volume filter to a minimum of 500 and the KD filter to a maximum of 10.Further readingHow to use the Organic keywords reportHow to find keywords your competitor ranks for, but you don’tGo to Competitive AnalysisEnter your domain in the This target doesn’t rank for sectionEnter your competitor’s domain in the But these competitors do sectionHit “Show keyword opportunities,” and you’ll see all the keywords your competitor ranks for, but you don’t.You can also add a Volume and KD filter to find popular, low-difficulty keywords in this report.How to find keywords multiple competitors rank for, but you don’tGo to Competitive AnalysisEnter your domain in the This target doesn’t rank for sectionEnter the domains of multiple competitors in the But these competitors do sectionYou’ll see all the keywords that at least one of these competitors ranks for, but you don’t.You can also narrow the list down to keywords that all competitors rank for.

But what do you do with them? There are basically three options.1. Create pages to target these keywordsYou can only rank for keywords if you have content about them. So, the most straightforward thing you can do for competitors’ keywords you want to rank for is to create pages to target them.However, before you do this, it’s worth clustering your competitor’s keywords by Parent Topic. This will group keywords that mean the same or similar things so you can target them all with one page.Here’s how to do that:Export your competitor’s keywords, either from the Organic Keywords or Content Gap reportPaste them into Keywords ExplorerClick the “Clusters by Parent Topic” tabFor example, MailChimp ranks for keywords like “what is digital marketing” and “digital marketing definition.” These and many others get clustered under the Parent Topic of “digital marketing” because people searching for them are all looking for the same thing: a definition of digital marketing. You only need to create one page to potentially rank for all these keywords.2. Optimize existing content by filling subtopicsYou don’t always need to create new content to rank for competitors’ keywords. Sometimes, you can optimize the content you already have to rank for them.How do you know which keywords you can do this for? Try this:Export your competitor’s keywordsPaste them into Keywords ExplorerClick the “Clusters by Parent Topic” tabLook for Parent Topics you already have content aboutFor example, if we analyze our competitor, we can see that seven keywords they rank for fall under the Parent Topic of “press release template.”If we search our site, we see that we already have a page about this topic.If we click the caret and check the keywords in the cluster, we see keywords like “press release example” and “press release format.”To rank for the keywords in the cluster, we can probably optimize the page we already have by adding sections about the subtopics of “press release examples” and “press release format.”3. Target these keywords with Google AdsPaid keywords are the simplest—look through the report and see if there are any relevant keywords you might want to target, too.For example, Mailchimp is bidding for the keyword “how to create a newsletter.”If you’re ConvertKit, you may also want to target this keyword since it’s relevant.If you decide to target the same keyword via Google Ads, you can hover over the magnifying glass to see the ads your competitor is using.You can also see the landing page your competitor directs ad traffic to under the URL column.Learn moreCheck out more tutorials on how to do competitor keyword analysis:Keyword Competitive Analysis: How to Find Your Competitors’ KeywordsHow to Do a Content Gap Analysis [With Template]How to Do an SEO Competitor Analysis Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Article by Si Quan Ong Content marketer @ Ahrefs.
