Let’s take a closer look.ContentsSidenote. Want your community featured? Send me a message.A brief history: SEO groups in SingaporeHistorically, the SEO community in Singapore hasn’t been particularly active.The longest-standing community—though not entirely SEO-focused—is APAC Marketers by David Fallarme. If its Slack group is any indication, there are around 180 members based in Singapore. (Just check out its dedicated #singapore channel!)We even hosted a group meet-up in our office earlier this year: Source: LinkedInGoing back in time (to 2016), the now-defunct SG SEO was an early attempt to bring together SEO professionals in the country. While they had occasional meet-ups over four years, founder David Chan stepped down just as the Covid pandemic descended. Our very own Tim Soulo then acquired the group while paying a small maintenance fee. Sadly, the online community was abandoned after some unsuccessful attempts to revive it: With that, Tim decided to focus on other efforts to engage the local community—more on that in a bit. SEO meetups in SingaporeThere are only two local meet-ups we’re aware of at present: Middy’s, and Ahrefs’ SEO Beer & Snacks event. Middy’sAPAC Marketers’ community member Robert Lai launched a spin-off meet-up called Middy’s for marketers around the region to network in person. It’s a casual, monthly affair that takes place in Singapore, Jakarta, and Sydney—and you don’t have to be a member to join in. Events are announced on APAC Marketers’ LinkedIn page.Depending on how the local community shapes up, Robert says the meet-up might evolve to include more structured sharings and presentations in future. Ahrefs’ SEO Beer & SnacksWe started ramping up our community efforts after bringing in our events marketing manager, Shermin (she’s a star!). In Feb 2023, we hosted our first-ever SEO Beer & Snacks session in the Ahrefs’ office—and have had six meet-ups since. These free, casual events give in-house marketers, SEOs, and business owners a chance to mingle and network over pizza. It’s a doozy: View this post on InstagramA post shared by Ahrefs (@ahrefs) We occasionally host content marketing and SEO workshops, too, where we share insights into our content strategy and use cases of Ahrefs.
