Set one to two SMART marketing objectives for the yearWhat is the first thing you do when you begin planning for a vacation? You decide where to go, aka the destination.It‚Äôs the same for marketing. To head somewhere, you must first decide where you want to go. You can‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve reached your destination if you don‚Äôt set one in the first place. That means knowing what marketing objectives you‚Äôre trying to achieve.You can‚Äôt be vague too. ‚ÄúIncrease sales by 30%‚Äù inspires no one. Instead, you should create objectives that fit the SMART criteria:Specific ‚Äì Clearly state the desirable outcome and explain who, what, when, how much, etc.Measurable ‚Äì Track progress with key performance indicators (KPIs).Achievable ‚Äì Set bold goals, but also be realistic; use the current growth as a benchmark.Relevant ‚Äì Does the objective align with your overall marketing and business strategy?Timely ‚Äì Set up a time frame for achieving the goal.For example, if we were to create a marketing objective for our blog, it might be something like this:Grow organic traffic from 300K to 700K by the end of 2022.Recommended reading: Marketing Objectives: How to Set Them Right (With Examples)2. Track the right marketing KPIs for your marketing objectivesYour GPS tells you if you‚Äôre going the right way when traveling. But what‚Äôs the GPS for your marketing?Those are your marketing KPIs. After you‚Äôve decided on your objectives (i.e., your destination), these KPIs tell you if you‚Äôre going in the right direction.But not all KPIs are equal. You likely don‚Äôt care about how many kilometers you‚Äôve traveled. You just want to know if you‚Äôre getting closer or farther away. Same goes for marketing. There are many KPIs you can track, but most are simply vanity metrics.You only need to track a few to know if you‚Äôre going in the right direction. Read the article below to find out which KPIs are worth your time.Recommended reading: 7 Marketing KPIs Actually Worth Tracking3. Design a simple and logical website structurePeople and search engines may struggle to find pages on a disorganized website. So it‚Äôs usually best to use a flat website structure where all pages are no more than a few clicks away from the homepage.We recommend that most of your pages should be no more than four clicks from the homepage. If there are pages more than six clicks away, consider bringing them closer to your homepage to make it easier for visitors and search engines to find them.Recommended reading: Website Structure: How to Build Your SEO Foundation4. Create a clear positioning statement for your businessEven in tiny Singapore, there are hundreds of gyms and fitness centers. Why should someone choose your business over the others?They won‚Äôt‚Äîunless you tell them why.This is called positioning. And in your positioning statement, you must clearly explain what your product or service is, why it‚Äôs different, and why it matters to your target customers.It is impossible to teach you how to create one in a blog post (it‚Äôd take a book!), so I highly recommend that you read April Dunford‚Äôs ‚ÄúObviously Awesome‚Äù‚Äîa step-by-step guide to creating a positioning statement.Here‚Äôs a quick Cliffs Note:Understand who your best customers areList your competitive alternativesFigure out the attributes and features that make your product/service uniqueFigure out what these attributes and features do for your customersFind a target market that cares about these values5. Create a Google Business ProfileIf you‚Äôre a local business serving local customers, you‚Äôll need a Google Business Profile. Claiming this profile helps you rank better on relevant Google searches‚Äîboth on web search and Google Maps.Optimizing this is easy with Google My Business and takes only 30 minutes of your time. It‚Äôs a low-hanging fruit you should pick.Follow the guide below to learn how to create an optimized profile.Recommended reading: How to Optimize Google My Business in 30 Minutes6. Target low-competition topicsFinance writer Morgan Housel writes:The key is recognizing that the long run is just a collection of short runs, and capturing long-term growth means managing the short run effectively enough to ensure you can stick around for a long time.Simply put, if you can‚Äôt survive now, you can‚Äôt exist in the long term. So even if you want to rank for the most valuable keywords for your business, that‚Äôll take time. Meanwhile, start ranking for low-competition keywords.These are keywords you can rank for without much effort. You usually won‚Äôt have to build many links or have high website authority to rank for them and get organic traffic for your website.How do you find these keywords? Watch this video to learn how:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7hR-i6Go4cRecommended reading: How to Find Low-Competition Keywords for SEO7. Build a following on one social networkShould you start shimmying on TikTok or go old-school and stick with Instagram? Perhaps you should create multiple üßµ on Twitter or write broetry on LinkedIn. Or maybe you should take a punt on that new, upcoming social platform.Whatever it is, just choose one. Don‚Äôt join a platform just because it‚Äôs the latest, shiny tool.The allure to be present on multiple social media platforms is huge. But don‚Äôt give in to that temptation. Doing well on each platform means creating content that fits in natively. That is a lot of time, effort, and resources.It takes work, even if you‚Äôre repurposing content. Sure, Gary Vee may make it look easy, but that‚Äôs because he has a team behind him. If you‚Äôre a one-person operation, you can‚Äôt replicate his efforts overnight.Which social network should you choose? Well, that goes all the way back to your marketing objective (tip #1). If your target audience is on Twitter and it moves you closer to your goal, then that‚Äôs the platform you want.After you‚Äôve built a strong following, expand to other social media platforms. For example, Instagram has been around since 2010, but we‚Äôve only recently started our Instagram account.8. Build a damn email listEven though we recommend building a following on one platform, you should remember that you‚Äôll never own that audience. You‚Äôre ‚Äúborrowing,‚Äù which means you‚Äôre always at the mercy of the platform.If it wants to limit your reach one day, it can. But email is different‚Äîyou own the list. Nobody can limit your reach. So even though building an email list seems like digital marketing advice from 2005, it‚Äôs not bad advice.Every business should have an email list.The simplest way to build one is to offer potential subscribers something in exchange for joining the list. This can be anything: an eBook, a course, a discount, or more.For us at Ahrefs, we have a simple ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù opt-in:9. Target topics with search traffic potentialIf you want to rank on Google, the topic you‚Äôre targeting should be one that people are searching for. That makes sense, right? Yet, most businesses begin blogging by creating an article and praying that it ranks.Hope is not a strategy. We want to get intentional. We want our articles to rank. To do that, we need to target topics with search traffic potential.How do you find such topics? Here‚Äôs how:Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Keywords ExplorerEnter a relevant topicGo to the Matching terms reportSwitch the tab to QuestionsAs you can see, there are over 197K topics you could potentially target. Eyeball the list and pick out topics that are relevant.Recommended reading: Keyword Research: The Beginner‚Äôs Guide by Ahrefs10. ‚ÄúSteal‚Äù your competitors‚Äô keywordsWhat if you could figure out which keywords your competitors rank for so that you could replicate their strategy?Good news: you can. Here‚Äôs how:Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Site ExplorerEnter a competitor‚Äôs domainGo to the Top pages reportHere, all your competitor‚Äôs pages are ranked by the amount of organic traffic they receive, plus the keyword that sends each page the most traffic.Look through the list and tackle the ones that are most relevant to your business.11. Create a versus pageYour customers want the biggest bang for their buck. So they‚Äôll compare you and your competitors. Once again, rather than leave it to chance, you should take the initiative.Create a versus page where you compare the pros and cons between your business and a competitor‚Äôs.How do you know who your customers are comparing you with? Here‚Äôs how to find out:Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Keywords ExplorerEnter your brand nameGo to the Matching terms reportUnder the Terms menu, choose ‚Äúvs‚Äù (or some other term that signifies comparison)Doing this for our own brand shows that people are comparing us with Moz, SEMRush, and Majestic.At this point, most businesses will create separate comparison pages for each competitor. However, we decided to do something different and created a versus page that tackled all of them at once.One page or a few‚Äîthe choice is yours.12. Make a statistics pageJournalists often need to back up their arguments with data. However, they don‚Äôt always have access to this information. So they‚Äôll look for data online, then mention and link to that source of data.For example, in 2020, Ahrefs was mentioned in Bloomberg because of our top Google searches data.But not everyone has access to unique data. So one way to get around this is to curate a list of statistics for your industry.That‚Äôs what we did when we created our SEO statistics page. Since then, we‚Äôve ranked #1 for the query ‚ÄúSEO statistics‚Äù and have accumulated ~2.4K links from ~1.1K unique websites.Learn how we did it here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTF6OBwidhc&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u_ABxIRO6RVK3ucKyzn96YRecommended reading: Link Building Case Study: How We Built Backlinks With a ‚ÄòStats‚Äô Page13. Use HARONot only do journalists need data, but they also need expert insights. And Help a Reporter Out (HARO) exists to connect journalists to experts.If you‚Äôre an expert in your industry, you can be that source of information too. Sign up, monitor the requests in your category, and respond with valuable information as soon as possible.My colleague, Michal Pec√°nek, has tons of experience with HARO. Here are some tips from him:Check the publication ‚Äì Avoid those that aren‚Äôt authoritative.Be picky ‚Äì Only respond to requests where you can truly provide great information.Respond as fast as possible ‚Äì Many people are monitoring the same niche as you.Get help ‚Äì Don‚Äôt hesitate to bring colleagues on board if they‚Äôre more qualified to answer.Stick to the script ‚Äì Don‚Äôt deviate from the format the author is requesting.Recommended reading: 9 Great Public Relations Tactics With Campaign Examples14. Capture featured snippetsIf you‚Äôve searched for something in Google and seen this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ then you‚Äôve seen a featured snippet.Capturing one means leapfrogging all the other ranking websites and jumping into the first position. And you can do this without having to build links or rewrite your content.The easiest way to begin is to leverage content you already own. Here‚Äôs how to do it:Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Site ExplorerEnter your own domainGo to the Organic keywords reportFilter for featured snippets (where target doesn‚Äôt rank for) using the SERP features filterFilter for positions #2-10 using the Position filterYou‚Äôll get a list of low-hanging opportunities to steal featured snippets from your competitors.Then, how do you capture these snippets?We have a step-by-step guide that shows you how you can rework your content so that you stand the best chance of capturing the snippet. Read it below here.Recommended reading: How to Optimize for Google‚Äôs Featured Snippets15. Rank videos on GoogleYouTube videos rank on YouTube. Duh. But did you know YouTube videos rank on Google too?In fact, our YouTube channel got over 200K views from Google in the past year:To do this, you‚Äôll need to rank for topics that have both:Search traffic potential ‚Äì People are searching for these topics on YouTube and Google.Video intent ‚Äì People who prefer to watch a video instead of reading. Here‚Äôs how to find these topics:Go to Ahrefs‚Äô Content ExplorerRun this search: site:youtube.com inurl:watch title:topicSort the results by Page trafficThis should give you a list of relevant YouTube videos that currently get organic search traffic from Google. Eyeball the list for ones that are relevant to your business, then create a video that ranks:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BObU_VCwnvYRecommended reading: Video SEO: How to Rank YouTube Videos on Google16. Run ads on less popular platformsEveryone knows Facebook, Instagram, and Google Ads. Those are the go-tos when it comes to paid advertising. But don‚Äôt forget that YouTube, Twitter, Quora, and even TikTok have advertising platforms too. If your target audience is on these platforms and they fit your marketing objectives, then they‚Äôre worth considering.For example, we regularly run ads on YouTube.If you create YT tutorials that feature your product, consider spending üí∞ on ads. Doesn‚Äôt have to be a lot. In July, we spent 154.62 SGD (~112.75 USD) for 174.8 hours of watch time (10,488 minutes).That‚Äôs $0.01/min or $0.65/hour. Name a cheaper medium for relevant/focused attn ‚Äî Sam Oh (@samsgoh) August 16, 2020We also run ads on Quora:17. Outsource boring tasksThere‚Äôs a common saying that you should never do the same thing twice. If you find yourself doing something over and over again‚Äîand you‚Äôre not enjoying it at all‚Äîthen it‚Äôs a task you can outsource.Some tasks can be easily completed with the right tool. For example, instead of ‚Äúcopy-pasting‚Äù drafts to WordPress, we simply upload them by using Wordable.For other tasks, you may have to hire freelancers or even a full-time staff. Create standard operating procedures (SOPs), hire and train people using those documents, and refine your system.Learn how to outsource your marketing tasks using the framework below (it‚Äôs for SEO but can be generalized across any marketing channels):Recommended reading: How to Outsource SEO (Simple Framework)18. Double down on what‚Äôs workingAs you‚Äôre applying the tips from this post, keep a lookout for what‚Äôs working. Do the same for the existing channels and tactics you‚Äôve been using.Then, double down on them. Invest your resources. Make it generate more returns for you.That‚Äôs what we did at Ahrefs. We started with the blog. And when it was working, we scaled it up by hiring more writers, creating SOPs, etc. And since we knew that content marketing was working for us, we invested in creating more content‚Äîthis time on YouTube.With an eight-figure annual recurring revenue (ARR), our results speak for themselves.19. Be differentPablo Picasso once said, ‚ÄúGood artists copy, great artists steal.‚ÄùInspired by this quote, marketers started copying each other. If there was a strategy that worked, countless others would follow suit‚Äîsometimes without consideration for their own circumstances.Sometimes, this idea worked. But most of the time, what happened was that the marketplace was glutted with imitations.I guess there‚Äôs a new trend in SaaS homepage design üòÜ pic.twitter.com/5qhQOCVBi5‚Äî Tim Soulo üá∫üá¶ (@timsoulo) July 12, 2019 Marketing is about differentiation. That‚Äôs why you need a positioning strategy. That‚Äôs why you create a comparison page. You want to stand above the competition. But if you are the same as the rest, there‚Äôs no reason for others to choose you.I think there‚Äôs nothing wrong with following best practices. But try to add your own twist. For example, look at our homepage and our versus page.The tactics we used are not unique, but we‚Äôve always tried to be different.Final thoughtsI hope you‚Äôve walked away from this post with a handful of actionable digital marketing tips you can test for your business.Did I miss out on any cool tips?
