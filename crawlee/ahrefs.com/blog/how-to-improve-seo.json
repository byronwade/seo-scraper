Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents Search engine optimization (SEO) is a long-term game.But that doesn’t mean there aren’t any low-hanging opportunities to improve your SEO. Not only will the tactics below improve your search engine rankings, but they also don’t need you to create new content.Let’s learn how to improve SEO.Contents1. Get more clicks on your top-ranking pagesThe title tag is one of the first things a searcher sees (alongside the meta description):Making the title tag attractive can entice them to choose your page over the others on the SERPs.However, there is no point in optimizing the title tags of pages that won’t be seen by searchers. So we want to focus on pages that are already ranking high, specifically those in positions #2–5.Here’s how to find them:Go to Ahrefs’ Site ExplorerEnter your domainGo to the Top pages reportSet the Position filter to 2–5We can then use ChatGPT as inspiration to create compelling title tags. For example, let’s ask it to create 10 click-worthy titles for this blog post. For best results, I’ll give it a working title and ask it to limit these titles to a maximum of 60 characters (since Google cuts off title tags beyond that).Pretty decent. And we can make it even better, using the strategies in the articles below.Further readingHow to Craft the Perfect SEO Title Tag (Our 4-Step Process)How to Improve Click-Through Rate (CTR): 9 Tried & Tested Tips 2. Refresh content with diminishing trafficAt Ahrefs, we perform a content audit every quarter. In one such audit, I discovered that organic traffic to our post on free SEO tools was declining. So I updated it. And traffic shot up.The easiest way to find content worth updating is to install our free WordPress SEO plugin and run a content audit. This will tell you which articles to update to get more traffic. Then follow the steps in the resource below to update these posts.Further readingRepublishing Content: How to Update Old Blog Posts for SEO3. Fill content gaps in existing contentIf the top-ranking pages for your target keyword cover similar subtopics, they’re likely important and what searchers expect to see.We can find these subtopics by looking at the common keywords the top-ranking pages rank for. Here’s how to find these “content gaps”:Enter your target keyword into Ahrefs’ Keywords ExplorerScroll to the SERP OverviewCheck up to five relevant competing pagesClick Open in and choose Content gapThis opens up the Content Gap report, where you’ll see the common keyword rankings among these pages. Look through the results to see if there are any subtopics you can cover. For example, if we wanted to update our post on earned media, we might consider including subtopics like these:Owned media examplesPaid media examplesPaid vs. earned mediaThis will make our blog post more comprehensive and help us create high-quality content.4. Boost important pages with internal linksInternal links are links from one page on the same domain to another. Internal links aid the flow of PageRank around your site (which is a confirmed Google ranking factor). When used correctly, they can help improve your SEO rankings.Here’s how to find pages to add internal links to:Sign up for the free Ahrefs Webmaster Tools (AWT)Run a crawl using Ahrefs’ Site AuditWhen the crawl is done, go to the Internal link opportunities reportThis report shows you relevant internal link opportunities on your own site. Search for your “money” pages by setting the filter to “Target page” and entering a relevant keyword phrase.Look through the recommended suggestions. Where relevant, add your internal links.

But if you have broken pages that many sites are linking to, you’re losing potential referral traffic and “link equity.”Here’s how to find these pages:Go to Ahrefs’ Site ExplorerEnter your domainGo to the Best by links reportSet the “HTTP code” filter to 404 not foundSort the results by Referring domainsThen follow this flowchart to decide how to “fix” a dead link:Further readingHow to Find and Fix Broken Links (To Reclaim Valuable “Link Juice”) 6. Go after featured snippetsGoogle often shows a full or partial answer to a query directly on the SERPs.This is known as a featured snippet, and you can often jump ahead of other websites by grabbing it. But how do you win the snippet?First things first: From our knowledge, you’d have to be already ranking on the first page of Google’s search results. Which means to optimize for featured snippets, you’ll have to find keywords:That are showing featured snippets.Where you’re ranking in the top 10.With decent traffic potential.Here’s how to find them:Go to Ahrefs’ Site ExplorerEnter your domainGo to the Organic keywords reportSet the Position filter to 2–10Use the SERP features filter to find keywords that trigger featured snippets “where target doesn’t rank”Look through the list to see if there are opportunities where you can grab the snippet. Here’s a great example where we currently rank #3 for “seo content strategy”:Looks like the snippet demands a definition for “seo strategy,” which we didn’t have on our page. We could include that definition and, hopefully, win the snippet for ourselves. Further readingGoogle’s Featured Snippets: All You Need to Know to Get Them 7. Include FAQ sectionsFAQ sections answer popular questions about a topic. Adding them to your page can help you rank higher for long-tail keywords and potentially improve your Google rankings.Because we answered a common question related to H1 tags—the length—we now rank on Google when people are searching for this answer:Here’s how to find frequently asked questions to answer:Go to Keywords ExplorerEnter your topicGo to the Matching terms reportToggle to “Questions”8. Claim unlinked mentionsUnlinked mentions are online mentions of your brand or product that don’t link back to your site. For example, this page mentions us but doesn’t link back:Here’s how to find unlinked mentions for your brand:Go to Ahrefs’ Web ExplorerSearch using these parameters: [brand] -outlinkdomain:yourdomain.com -site:yourdomain.comIn this example, there are millions of pages to look through, so it’s worth filtering the report by Domain Rating (DR) or referring domains to exclude “low-value” opportunities. Here’s an example of an unlinked mention we found for our brand:Rather than just reaching out and asking the author to add a link or make the link “clickable,” think about how you can help improve the content and make it beneficial for the author.In our example, since it’s a product review and there was no mention of our free SEO tools or AWT, we could reach out and let the author know.Further readingA Simple Guide to Turning (Unlinked) Brand Mentions Into Links 9. Improve your Core Web VitalsPart of Google’s Page Experience signals, Core Web Vitals (CWV) consist of these:Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)First Input Delay (FID)They are Google ranking factors.You can check your CWV data using PageSpeed Insights, a free tool provided by Google that analyzes a page’s performance and provides suggestions for improving its loading speed and user experience.You can also connect PageSpeed Insights’ API to Site Audit and see your Core Web Vitals together with other technical SEO issues:Further readingA Primer on Core Web VitalsLargest Contentful Paint (LCP) – Defined, Measured, & How to FixCumulative Layout Shift (CLS) – Defined, Measured, & How to FixFirst Input Delay (FID) – Defined, Measured, & How to Fix10.

Repurpose existing content into multiple formatsIf you’ve already created a piece of content, you can go the extra mile by repurposing it into different formats. For example, we turned our SEO checklist into a video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taU9P98zfjkI also turned my post on the Skyscraper Technique into a Twitter thread:Does the Skyscraper Technique still work?We asked our followers this question and received 1,242 votes.

Well, YouTube videos rank on Google search results too:Google also introduced Perspectives in 2023. This is a tab on the SERPs that allows users to see results from TikTok, YouTube, Quora, Reddit, tweets, and more. Heads-up! Perspectives rolled out on 6/12 and officially last week, but now I’m seeing the sister SERP feature that Google said would show up in the 10 blue links. It’s also labeled “Perspectives”, provides cards for discussions, social, etc. & links to the Perspectives filter: pic.twitter.com/0NBEEPI31a— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) June 29, 2023 Essentially, Google will begin showing results from other channels too, not just websites.

Here’s how to find industry and local directories:Go to Ahrefs’ Site ExplorerEnter your domainGo to the Link Intersect reportAdd your competitors to the top sectionHit Show link opportunitiesThis will show you the websites linking to one or more of your competitors’ homepages, but not to yours.
