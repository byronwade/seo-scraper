They generally reflect how visible and engaging your content on social media is, making them a good indicator of your content distribution success.If you‚Äôve been in SEO for a while or you‚Äôve already done some research, you‚Äôve probably come across claims that social signals are an SEO ranking factor. That‚Äôs not true, at least according to multiple statements from Google‚Äôs spokespeople.But even though Google doesn‚Äôt take social signals into account in its ranking algorithms, it still makes sense to keep improving them. In fact, many businesses can significantly improve their SEO by putting more effort into their social media content distribution.Want to make more sense of it and learn how you can improve your social signals to help your SEO? Keep on reading.ContentsSocial signals aren‚Äôt an SEO ranking factorWe should first discuss the reasons why social signals aren‚Äôt a ranking factor. Of course, the most straightforward ones are claims like this one from John Mueller, Google‚Äôs search advocate:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WszvyRune14#t=1192Even though it‚Äôs quite an old video already, it‚Äôs the most straight-to-the-point statement regarding social signals and SEO I could find from Google‚Äôs spokespeople. There have been many other claims implying the same since then.Now, here‚Äôs my take on why social signals don‚Äôt make sense as a ranking factor.First of all, social media is full of spam and fake accounts. You can buy unlimited followers, likes, etc., for pennies. How should Google identify social signals from real accounts when social media platforms themselves struggle with filtering and banning all this spam?Then there‚Äôs the role of social media algorithms. A lot of great content gets buried with no to low visibility, while a lot of bad content gets traction. If you manage a huge account or amplify your social media posts, you get an advantage that has nothing to do with the content itself.That said, the posts that tend to get popular on social media aren‚Äôt usually really made to rank in search, and vice versa. Can you imagine ‚Äúboring, but necessary‚Äù articles like this getting tons of likes, shares, and comments?Me neither. I can‚Äôt think of sharing this in a way that will stop many people from scrolling their feeds and engaging with the post. If I feel like that as the author, others must be even more disincentivized from sharing that.But it targets keywords with solid search demand and ranks for them. It delivers what people looking that up want to learn about.On the other hand, one of my most popular tweets was things many people don‚Äôt know about bounce rate; I also linked to the article at the end of the thread:Bounce Rate One of the most misunderstood Google Analytics metrics.9 things you might not have known.ü¶ò//THREAD//‚Äî Michal Pec√°nek (@michalpecanek) December 2, 2020 The first tweet from the thread above got some great social signals, but even the last one containing the link to the post itself wasn‚Äôt too bad:But the article never ranked well in Google:Screenshot taken from the Organic keywords report in Ahrefs‚Äô Site Explorer.Keep in mind that even if I found many other examples like this, it wouldn‚Äôt prove any causality because we‚Äôre looking at just one variable. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of variables involved in both search engine and social media ranking algorithms.The point is there isn‚Äôt a big overlap in factors that make content popular on social media and in search engines, so it won‚Äôt even make sense to consider aligning their rankings.How can strong social signals improve your SEO anywayContent distribution is the Achilles‚Äô heel of many marketing teams. They spend a lot of time on creating great content, but there‚Äôs often not much they do after publishing it.Social media (both organic and paid) is an important channel to use in your content distribution mix. Here‚Äôs why improving your social signals can improve your SEO too.Social media is a part of your SEO and content marketing flywheelsRand Fishkin popularized the term ‚Äúmarketing flywheel‚Äù as a set of continuous and repeatable marketing efforts that reinforce each other, making more impact with less effort after each iteration.Here‚Äôs Rand‚Äôs SEO and content flywheel diagram to make things crystal clear:This can also be perceived as a snowball effect in the context of marketing tactics.You can see that content distribution occupies the whole left side of the diagram. Social media is a crucial part of that, and strong social signals reflect the success on this front.Simply, if you take out the focus on social media from the flywheel, you‚Äôll experience much more friction.An indicator of becoming an authority in your nicheOne of the parts of the flywheel model is this: ‚ÄúGrow your authority to rank better in search engines.‚ÄùWhile this is a simplified view and being an authority can be just one of many variables involved to rank well, it‚Äôs certainly an aspect that‚Äôs been growing in importance in recent years.Authoritativeness represents one of the acronyms in Google‚Äôs concept of E-E-A-T that‚Äôs used to evaluate and tweak Google‚Äôs search ranking systems. The other letters stand for expertise, experience, and trustworthiness.Google‚Äôs Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines mention social media multiple times. It makes sense that it‚Äôs something Google needs to pay attention to in terms of assessing people‚Äôs and brands‚Äô E-E-A-T.Here‚Äôs a good take on this from one of the most respected experts in this field, Marie Haynes:I believe that social signals can speak to your E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trust). If people all over the web are talking about your brand (in a good way), then Google may consider you an authority and want to rank you higher. https://t.co/gzbUtSbCER‚Äî Marie Haynes (@Marie_Haynes) June 15, 2018 Now think about the accounts you follow on social media to learn about things. They likely signal many, if not all, the E-E-A-T components. That‚Äôs what you should aim to achieve with your brand on social media (and elsewhere) too.You‚Äôd get the advantage of compounding your social signals and being often referred to as a go-to resource. We can shamelessly claim to be such an authority in the SEO industry. That effect translates into automatically getting links to all of our new pieces of content, for example:Screenshot taken from the Backlinks report in Ahrefs‚Äô Site Explorer.This particular example got most of the initial traffic thanks to the author, Patrick Stox, sharing that on his Twitter:I looked at dozens of examples of sites going viral, award winners, case studies, etc.I thought for sure all those links from major news sites would help the sites rank better for other terms.Spoiler alert: I was wrong.https://t.co/sWoQs7h5v2‚Äî Patrick Stox (@patrickstox) April 3, 2023 Patrick himself is one of the biggest SEO authorities, and the fact that he shared a hot take that sparked discussions certainly helped too. But we‚Äôre seeing similar effects on initial backlink acquisition across the board.Of course, sometimes the links are mostly worthless, as most of them come from content aggregators and spam websites. But we can often see it being showcased in industry news, as shown above with one of our recent pieces.Strong correlation with Discover trafficGoogle Discover is an automatically generated and highly personalized mobile feed based on your online activity. It shows information and news about the topics that interest you, like SEO, photography, or traveling.I know many people who don‚Äôt know this feed exists on their mobile devices, but I also know businesses that drive the majority of their organic traffic through this feed (like news and content-heavy websites).Even a B2B SaaS blog like ours can get a solid chunk of traffic from it:Discover is largely a black box that‚Äôs difficult to optimize for. But one of the variables with a strong correlation to Discover performance is the buzz generated with your content distribution.Google seems to push pieces of content that get popular on social media to the top of its Discover feed too. Strong social signals can very well translate into nice Discover performance.Further readingGoogle Discover: How to Rank and Drive TrafficFive key tips to integrate your SEO and social media effortsIt should now be clear that you need a strong SEO and social media game if you want the best performance from your content marketing.This chart shows how you ideally begin driving traffic with your content distribution efforts that later translate into more passive, organic traffic:We‚Äôve got a whole guide on content distribution, and there are countless good resources on learning social media marketing. For this reason, we‚Äôll only go through the most relevant tips that matter in integrating your social media and SEO efforts.1. Interlink and reconcile your website with social media profilesWe‚Äôve already got the premise that building your brand and authority on social media could also benefit your SEO. Google is able to reconcile author and brand signals from multiple sources, including social media.To make the work easier for Google, there are two basic things you should do.The first one is interlinking your website with your social media profiles. Your website likely already contains links to your social profiles, and your social profiles likely link to your website. But there‚Äôs a way to reinforce this connection in the eyes of Google‚ÄîsameAs schema markup.Schema markup is a code that helps search engines to understand your content and better represent it in the search results. There are countless ways to mark up your content. But one of the basic markups to get right is on a page that describes your company, usually your homepage or About page.Here‚Äôs an excerpt of what it looks like on Ahrefs‚Äô About page:The highlighted part is the sameAs property that points to other important Ahrefs company pages, including social media profiles.This is one of the most basic schema properties. The great news is that any solid, modern CMS makes it easy to add this to your pages. But schema, in general, is a more complex topic, so I suggest you check out my schema guide for beginners before you start marking up your pages.The second important aspect is to reconcile your company and product information on these important pages. The way you describe your company and products on your website should match the descriptions elsewhere too. This is important for building your entity in Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph, a topic that‚Äôs very relevant but also too complex to delve into here.In reality, it‚Äôs nothing more than mostly copy-pasting your About page to fit your other company pages, like Ahrefs‚Äô LinkedIn page:Lastly, this can lead to another SEO benefit: owning more search results on branded SERPs:2. Add link bait content to your content planLink bait is any content that‚Äôs primarily designed to attract backlinks. And guess what? Such content is also the best for generating buzz on social media and elsewhere.That‚Äôs because if someone finds something so interesting or valuable to link to, we can also assume they‚Äôll be keen to engage with that on social media.If we take a look at our most linked-to pages on our blog‚Ä¶Screenshot from the Best by links report in Ahrefs‚Äô Site Explorer.‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll find out that 8 out of 10 pages above are also among the most shared ones on social media:Screenshot taken from the Top content report in Ahrefs‚Äô Site Explorer.Needless to say that many of these pages also drive significant organic traffic. This is the type of content that‚Äôs the most difficult to execute well from start to finish, but it‚Äôs worth it on all fronts.Proper content distribution is key for this content to succeed. You need to go all in, especially for those pieces that don‚Äôt target any keyword and are purely made for attracting links and creating buzz. That‚Äôs the case of our featured snippets study from both screenshots above.Further reading‚Äã‚ÄãWhat Is Link Bait? 7 Successful Examples3. Reach out to people whose content you refer toCreating great content is often not possible without referring to other authoritative and relevant sources. Adding the right links to your content is yet another E-E-A-T signal.But linking to other websites has even more benefits. It‚Äôs an invitation to open up a conversation and get something from the other party in return‚Äîlike asking them to help you with content distribution.Take one of my recent articles about international link building, for example. I wrote it in collaboration with four other SEO experts who were keen to distribute it to their own networks:Even though this is something you‚Äôre not likely to do for many pieces of content, I used this article for a more evergreen case too. That‚Äôs citing resources of others who don‚Äôt know about it at the time of writing and publishing:I reached out to Mark, who authored the survey, and he was keen to share my article on the Authority Hacker feed:This is for everyone‚Äôs benefit. I featured Mark‚Äôs survey quite heavily so he can get some valuable referral traffic from the link and also ever-increasing link equity, should my article keep on attracting backlinks. You can also just tag the social accounts of the referred sources, but that won‚Äôt likely convert as well as the direct outreach.This tactic is also often used for building links, and it‚Äôs known as ego baiting.4. Repurpose your content to other channels and mediumsEvery communication medium you use to organically share your content‚Äîlike your blog, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, or newsletter‚Äîrequires specific content types and formats.There are threads on Twitter, image carousels on LinkedIn, linking to your blog in a short video on Instagram, you name it. What works for getting good results on one medium doesn‚Äôt necessarily work on another. It may not even be possible to format it that way.That said, the most important thing here to make everyone‚Äôs job easier is to use your existing content for what you use elsewhere. I‚Äôve already shown my thread about bounce rate, which was just excerpts from my article. Our social media manager, Rebecca Liew, does this frequently for our official account too:18 Ahrefs‚Äô hacks we bet you didn‚Äôt know of ‚ö°üßµ pic.twitter.com/Rah41va41S‚Äî Ahrefs (@ahrefs) March 23, 2023 This is among the best content formats that work well for us on Twitter. Reb wrote a post diving deep into our Twitter approach if you want to learn more.But our posts on LinkedIn, which is our second most important social medium after Twitter, naturally look different: There are certainly still more similarities than differences, so the main two aspects they have in common are that:They‚Äôre repurposed from our blog and video content.They don‚Äôt contain links in the main post.I know, we‚Äôve been talking about social signals mostly related to social media posts that contain links to your content. But native content generally performs better than posts containing a link to your website. It makes sense, as social media platforms earn more money by keeping their users with them for longer.That said, you‚Äôre still growing your brand and E-E-A-T even if you don‚Äôt link out. We still add links to our social posts, but it‚Äôs not the main type of content we post on social media.So the tl;dr key to success here is to take advantage of what you already have and use it in different ways across multiple platforms in various formats. Some of it will eventually stick, and you‚Äôll learn a lot along the way.

Let the experts handle social media (and nurture good relationships with them)Last but not least, it‚Äôs important to bring up that I‚Äôm not a social media specialist and that most other SEOs (or marketers in general) aren‚Äôt either.I‚Äôve done a bunch of successful organic and paid social media campaigns, but my knowledge pales in comparison with social media specialists. I even feel like I‚Äôm bad at social media sometimes.It certainly doesn‚Äôt help that many companies are looking for unicorns who are experts on multiple channels. But I have yet to meet someone who‚Äôs an expert in three or more marketing channels. They can‚Äôt have it all.My suggestion is that if you don‚Äôt already have a social media specialist on your team, you should at least consider hiring a consultant to help you get things going in the right direction.But if you already have this covered or you‚Äôre outsourcing that to an agency, just make sure not to leave them out of the conversation. SEO is a multidisciplinary field, and you need the support of other channels and departments to make the most out of it.After all, they can use your knowledge and data too.Further readingHow to Fit SEO Into Your Marketing StrategyFinal thoughtsAll right, I have one extra tip for wrapping things up. It‚Äôs something most companies fail at.Don‚Äôt stop with your content distribution whenever you have a new piece of content out. Or in an even worse case, when it‚Äôs the next day and you‚Äôve already sent out the one and only obligatory social media post.It‚Äôs completely fine and desirable to send out the same or similar stuff on social media over and over again within a reasonable time frame. The people who see it one time don‚Äôt necessarily see it the other and, even if they do, they‚Äôre unlikely to remember that.Got any questions? Ping me on Twitter.
