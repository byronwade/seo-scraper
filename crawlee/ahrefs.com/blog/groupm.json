Not a walk in the park under the best circumstances. But what happens when you throw in a 50,000-page migration and a previous brand-heavy SEO strategy into the mix? You risk creating an underperforming site riddled with technical errors.Solution: Switch to Ahrefs to tackle Enterprise-level challenges1. Powerful technical audits minimized errors during the migrationAhrefs’ Site Audit tool played a key role in ensuring that the year-long migration of the client’s website happened smoothly, with as little disruption as possible. Regular site audits were conducted to find and fix technical issues that would jeopardize the website’s visibility in search, such as:Redirect chainsDuplicate meta titles, descriptions & heading tags404 errorsNon-200 pages in sitemapEventually, GroupM managed to improve the website’s Site Audit Health Score from 51 to 97.2. Find the most impactful keywords with worldwide language coverageThe website’s existing organic traffic was coming from mostly brand-term heavy keywords. GroupM used Competitor AnalysisandKeywords explorer to sift through Ahrefs’ 12 billion keyword database for many relevant Turkish keywords in the furniture and home living niche. This allowed them to form new, non-branded content avenues and design them into the new website’s structure. These ranged from simple queries such as “kitchen cupboard” and “bookcase” to more nuanced searches like “balcony table chair” and “bedroom set”. Creating content around these new avenues also gained them a 115% increase in non-branded organic traffic in just under 9 months3. Create reports that communicate progress effectivelyGroupM expanded IKEA’s website architecture into 1000+ categories and created content pages accordingly. This set strong fundamentals for IKEA Turkey to grow organically beyond their brand name. Aided by Looker Studio Connectors GroupM was also able to create custom reports that served as a proxy for reporting progress on their SEO efforts on these multiple fronts.Solve SEO problems with Enterprise-grade capabilities:Sign up for an Ahrefs account and get started with the tools that helped GroupM take on this complex website migration projectKeywords ExplorerSite ExplorerSite AuditLooker Studio Connectors Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Article by Constance Tan Constance is devoted to improving the value users get out of Ahrefs.
