Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents Every year, the SEO agency Aira conducts a State of Link Building survey.In the most recent edition, 270 SEOs voted for the link-building techniques they still use today.Let’s look at how to do these seven tactics.Contents1. Content marketing specifically to generate linksAlso known as creating link bait, the goal is to create something so valuable and interesting that other people want to link to it. How to do itThere’s no surefire way to do this. If it was so easy, everyone would be doing it. That said, there are ways to find link-bait ideas. One way is to piggyback off what’s already working for your competitors. Here’s how:Go to Ahrefs’ Site ExplorerEnter your competitor’s domain Go to the Best by links reportThis report shows which of your competitors’ pages attracted the most backlinks. Eyeball the list to see what topics and formats resonate in your industry. For example, data studies and statistics are popular in the SEO niche:If you’re in this space, you can probably attract links to this kind of content, too.Just remember that creating content “designed to entice links” doesn’t mean you’ll automatically get them. People won’t magically find your content and link to it. You promote it. Learn how to do that in my content promotion post.Further readingWhat Is Link Bait? 7 Successful Examples6 Linkable Asset Types (And EXACTLY How to Earn Links With Them) 2. Competitor analysis and targeting their linksThis technique is about looking at how your competitors get links and how you can do the same for your website. How to do itFirst, you’ll need to check the backlink profile of your competitors’ websites. Here’s how:Go to Ahrefs’ Site ExplorerEnter your competitor’s domainGo to the Backlinks reportRather than identifying specific links to replicate, look for patterns. This will help you spot link-building strategies that your competitors are using successfully. For example, we see that the Moz team has appeared on multiple podcasts:This tells us that podcast link-building is a strategy that works in our industry. We can do the same too. We can curate podcast opportunities by looking for those our competitors have already appeared on, and we can also find more podcast opportunities by following the process in this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brRDrcFihVsFurther readingHow to Perform a Competitor Link Analysis in 3 StepsHow to Find Your Competitors’ Backlinks (And Get Them for Yourself) 3. Guest postingGuest posting is where you write a post for someone else’s website. How to do itThe best websites to write for are those that already get lots of traffic to content about similar topics to the one you want to write about. Here’s how to find these websites:Open Ahrefs’ Content ExplorerEnter a related topic and change the dropdown to “In title”Filter for English results Filter for results with 500+ wordsGo to the “Websites” tabThis shows you the websites getting the most organic search traffic to content about your topic.From here, you want to eyeball the Authors column and prioritize websites with multiple authors, as this often points to them accepting guest posts.For example, Perfect Keto gets an estimated 19K monthly search visits from 20 authors for the topic “low carb”:It’s likely that some of these are guest authors, so this could be a good site to pitch.Further readingGuest Blogging for SEO: Everything You Need to Know 4. Reactive PRReactive PR is where you react quickly to time-sensitive opportunities to earn links.How to do itIt varies from industry to industry, but it’s common to use Help a Reporter Out (HARO). This platform connects journalists looking for quotes and feedback to expert sources. You can sign up for free and respond to any you can answer.For example, a journalist at HandicappedPets.com put out a query:Dr. Jonathan Roberts, a veterinarian at PetKeen.com, responded and earned a link:After you sign up for HARO, you’ll receive three emails a day.Given that you should only respond to relevant queries where you have the expertise to answer, I recommend setting up some Gmail filters. This will spare your inbox by filtering out irrelevant opportunities.Here’s how to do it: Click the search options filterSet the “From” field to [email protected].Set the “Subject” to “[HARO]”Set “Has the words” to keywords you want to monitor (you can use the OR operator to list multiple keywords here)Hit search and check that everything’s correct. If all looks good, hit the search options caret again and click “Create filter.”Further readingReactive Digital PR: What It Is & How To Use It For Link Building 5. Broken link buildingBroken link building is where you:Find a dead page with linksCreate your own page on the topicAsk people linking to the dead page to link to you insteadHow to do itFirst, you’ll need to find a dead page with links. Here’s how:Go to Ahrefs’ Content ExplorerSearch for a topicFilter for broken pages onlyFilter for pages with 10+ referring domainsFor example, searching for “keto” finds this page with 104 referring domains:If you visit the page, you’ll see that it is indeed dead:Next, click on the caret next to the URL and click to view it on archive.org. This will show you how the page looked before it disappeared.If recreating this content makes sense for your site, do it, then reach out to all the people linking to the dead page and pitch yours as a replacement. You can find these linkers by entering the dead page’s URL into Site Explorer and going to the Backlinks report.Further readingBroken Link Building: The Complete Guide 6. Chasing brand mentionsThe main focus of this technique is trying to convert unlinked mentions to linked mentions.How to do itFirst, you need to find your unlinked mentions. You can do this by running the following search in Ahrefs’ Web Explorer: [your brand] -outlinkdomain:[yourwebsite].com -site:[yourwebsite].com -intitle:[your brand] This will search billions of pages for those that mention your brand name, but don’t link to you.For example, if you wanted to find unlinked mentions for Ahrefs.com, you’d search for this: In this case, the search finds over 59 million results:That’s too many to sift through, so I recommend adding these filters:Domain Rating: 30+ to remove low authority websites.Language: English to remove those who won’t understand your pitch.First seen: 6 months to remove old pages people don’t care about updating. One page per domain to remove duplicate websites. Filter explicit results to remove results your boss won’t want to see. Exclude subdomains to reduce spammy results. From there, look through the results for unlinked mentions that make sense to pitch. For example, this page discusses our new search engine:Although the article links to our search engine (Yep.com), it doesn’t link to Ahrefs. That’s especially odd as it mentions “ahrefs” 16 times and talks about us in the intro:Given that adding a link here would be helpful to readers who aren’t familiar with us, this is an unlinked mention worth chasing.Looking for another way to earn brand mentions?Try getting your brand included in listicles. For example, if you run a cafe in London and you’re not featured in lists of the best cafes in London, that’s an opportunity. To find relevant listicles, Google this query:best [business type] in [location] -”[your business name]”For example, if you’re the owner of Chinese Gourmet in London, you might search for something like this:If you find listicles that don’t include your restaurant (like the one below), reach out and see if they’d be willing to add you. Just keep in mind that your pitch needs to make sense. If the author of the listicle has never eaten at your restaurant, they’re hardly going to add you just because you asked. You’ll have more chance of success by inviting them down for some food and going from there.Further readingA Simple Guide to Turning (Unlinked) Brand Mentions into Links 7. Brand newsThis technique could mean various things, so I’ll focus on the “news” part. Essentially, it’s promoting relevant brand information (e.g., your company is going to IPO) and getting publications to cover it.How to do itThis technique is the remit of my colleague, Daria Samokish. She successfully got TechCrunch to cover our new search engine, Yep.
