Looking for a different format? Request it here.Why you should use our templateOur SEO audit template focuses on finding SEO issues that move the needle—not everything that can go wrong with a website. This is because sweating the small stuff rarely does much for your rankings. It’s better to spend 80% of your time fixing the 20% of things that matter.It’s also:Easy to follow (each step has clear instructions).Easy to outsource (just send it to an employee, freelancer, or VA).Interactive (check each item off the checklist as you go).Doing an SEO audit for a client?My buddy Patrick (who’s done way more SEO audits for clients than me!) has some great advice: If clients are coming to you asking for an audit, they already have a pain point. Talk to them. Solve that one thing and they’ll be happy with the audit.Patrick Stox, Product Advisor AhrefsWhat the template coversOur template has 13 items focused on issues in three categories:Technical issues like indexing and crawling. Content issues like outdated content and content gaps.Link issues like dead pages with backlinks.Sidenote. Remember that we’re not focused on finding every issue under the sun here. We’re focused on finding and fixing the stuff that matters. That’s why our template only has 13 steps, not an overwhelming 100-200 like many others.How to use the templateFollow the three simple steps below or watch the video walkthrough.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-mOukMWtFQ1. Crawl your websiteSet up a free Ahrefs Webmaster Tools (AWT) account and crawl your website with Site Audit.
