Improve Core Web Vitals (CWV)Core Web Vitals are site speed metrics Google uses to measure user experience as part of its Page Experience signals.They’re not a super strong ranking factor, but they can still impact rankings.To check if your Core Web Vitals need work, use the Core Web Vitals report in Google Search Console or the Performance report in Ahrefs’ Site Audit.Further readingA Primer on Core Web Vitals11. Combine similar pages using redirects Backlinks are a ranking factor, so it makes sense to combine very similar pages to consolidate authority and create a page with more “ranking power.”For example, in 2017, we had two similar guides to broken link building that ranked in positions #5 and #6:Here’s what we did:Updated the first guide with knowledge from both guidesRedirected the second guide there with a 301 redirectThe page shot to position #1 almost immediately, and it’s been in the top three ever since.12. Create comprehensive contentIf your content covers more relevant subtopics, it’ll likely rank for more search queries and get more traffic. Thorough content is high quality content.Here’s how to find the best subtopics to cover:Put your main keyword into Keywords ExplorerScroll to the SERP overview and select a few top-ranking pagesClick the “Open in” dropdown and select “Content gap”If we do this for the keyword “affiliate marketing,” we can see that the top-ranking pages also rank in the top 10 for these:what is affiliate marketinghow to become an affiliate marketerhow to do affiliate marketingBy covering these subtopics in a piece about “affiliate marketing,” we can potentially rank for them and get more traffic.13. Compile industry statistics to earn backlinksBloggers and journalists often quote statistics in their content. If you can be the source of these statistics, you can earn backlinks to your website.Here’s how to find statistics keywords to target:Enter a few broad topics into Keywords ExplorerGo to the Matching terms report Add “statistics” to the “Include” filterFor example, there are an estimated 600 monthly searches in the U.S. for “seo statistics”:If you were to curate and publish some SEO statistics on a page and rank for this term, chances are that bloggers and journalists would find your page when searching for statistics. They’d also be likely to link to your page as the source.This is what we did back in 2020. Our page now has backlinks from 1,900 other sites.Further readingLink Building Case Study: How We Built Backlinks With a ‘Stats’ Page (And Ranked #1)14. Improve E-E-A-T by including expert quotesE-E-A-T stands for experience, expertise, authority, and trust. It’s not a direct ranking factor, but Google says it uses “a variety of signals as a proxy to tell if content seems to match E-E-A-T.” Backlinks are one of these signals, and including expert quotes may help you get more of them.For example, here’s a backlink we earned to our hreflang tags guide, thanks to quoting John Mueller:Further readingE-E-A-T Is the New E-A-T. What the New “E” Means for SEO15. Use short and concise URLs Google says to use words that are relevant to your site’s content in your URL. The easiest way to do this is to set the URL slug as your target keyword.For example, our main keyword for this post is “seo tips,” so that’s our URL slug:If your URLs have subfolders, use common sense to keep them short and relevant. For example, the target keyword for our backlinks definition is “what are backlinks.” But as we already have /seo/glossary/ in the URL, we just used /backlinks/ as the slug because it’s clear from the rest of the URL that it’s a definition.
