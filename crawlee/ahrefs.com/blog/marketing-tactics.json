Think of them as the building blocks of your marketing strategy ‚Äî the concrete steps you can implement right away to start growing your brand. These tactics are the ‚Äòhow-to‚Äô of marketing, turning your big-picture goals into real-world results.In this guide, we‚Äôll explore 15 powerful yet beginner-friendly marketing tactics used by successful businesses today. We‚Äôll break down each tactic into simple steps, explain why it works, and provide real-world examples to inspire you.Contents1. Advertise your business with Google AdsThis is probably the quickest way to drive potential customers to any website. Google Ads is a shortcut to some of the premium spots on Google Search and Google Maps. You may know them from the first thing you see when you Google something. They basically work like this: you choose keywords relevant to your business, set up the ads, and declare how much you‚Äôre willing to pay for ads to show up on Google. Then Google runs an auction to decide which advertisers‚Äô ads should be shown. You pay for the ad only if someone clicks on it. The cool thing about this channel is that once you grasp it, you can scale it almost instantly by bidding on more keywords and increasing your budget. Measuring return on investment is fairly easy here, too. You‚Äôre earning money if the ads bring more revenue than they cost. 2. Use easy-to-rank keywords to boost your website‚Äôs visibility on GoogleOptimizing for low-difficulty keywords is an effective way to increase your website‚Äôs visibility on Google, especially when you‚Äôre just starting out.These are search terms that have less competition, making it easier for new or smaller websites to rank well in search results. This tactic involves identifying relevant keywords with lower competition, then strategically incorporating them into your website‚Äôs content.You will need three things:Low competition keywords relevant to your business. SEO content to rank for those keywords. Backlinks to increase your chances for ranking. But here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî you likely won‚Äôt need many to rank because they are low-difficulty keywords.Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre running a personal finance app. What you‚Äôd do is take a bunch of broad terms related to your business, e.g., ‚Äúbudgeting, credit card score, retirement.‚Äù You can brainstorm them, source them from your competitor‚Äôs website, or even ask ChatGPT. Next: Paste them into a tool like Ahrefs‚Äô Keywords Explorer.In Ahrefs, go to the Matching terms report.Filter for keywords below 20 KD (Keyword Difficulty).Look for ideas. And if the list is still too big to manage, you can further decrease Keyword Difficulty or set a minimum Traffic Potential to filter out the least popular keywords.For instance, here are a few interesting keywords. Relevant to a personal finance product, good traffic potential (TP) and low difficulty (KD):From here, it‚Äôs just a case of creating content about the topic and (possibly) building a few links to rank. Read the articles below to learn how:Further readingSEO Content: The Beginner‚Äôs Guide Link Building for SEO: The Beginner‚Äôs Guide 3. Educate, inspire, and entertain on social media with short-form videosSocial media loves short videos ‚Äî even if they look amateurish. According to a study of over 700k profiles across different social media platforms, short-form videos are the most engaging type of content.The best part? People are okay with these videos not being visual masterpieces. Want proof? Duolingo‚Äôs meme-like videos went viral on TikTok and Instagram. They‚Äôre short, entertaining, and look like they were shot on a phone. If what Duolingo does isn‚Äôt really your style, there are other ways to use videos. For example, if your company just reached a milestone, why not share that? View this post on InstagramA post shared by Made with Local (@madewithlocal) A quick product hack you can share? Go for it. View this post on InstagramA post shared by ILIA (@iliabeauty) This works for tech brands, too:Keyword clustering in @ahrefs is INSTANT! ‚ö°Ô∏èYou don‚Äôt need to upload the list of keywords and wait ‚åõÔ∏è until they will be organised into clusters.Here at Ahrefs we‚Äôve already done all the ‚Äúclustering‚Äù on the backend! So you can put your ‚Äúseed‚Äù keyword in and hundreds of‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/9RkdP7wtVw‚Äî Tim Soulo üá∫üá¶ (@timsoulo) October 4, 2023 As long as your videos aim to educate, inspire, or entertain your audience, you‚Äôre on the right track. So, for example, your videos can be about:Short product demos and feature highlightsYour brand‚Äôs journey to stardomBehind the scenes Tips, tricks, and how-to‚Äôs Upcoming product sneak peeks Hot takes on industry news Important company news and milestones Answers to FAQsHow to get started? You can avoid some rookie mistakes with guides like this one. But let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî your first videos won‚Äôt be an instant hit. There‚Äôs no other way around it than making more videos. So stop overthinking and start uploading. Then, if an idea takes off, double down on it.4. Let affiliates do the marketing for you Affiliate marketing is a performance-based strategy where your reward individuals or other companies (affiliates) for driving traffic or sales to their website.It involves setting up an affiliate program where you provide unique links or codes to your affiliates, who then promote your products or services through their own channels. When a customer makes a purchase through an affiliate‚Äôs link, the affiliate earns a commission.For example, if you want to spread the word about your life insurance app, an affiliate might recommend it through a review. When a reader clicks through to buy your product, it tracks where the sale came from so you can pay a commission.You can attract affiliates to your brand in a few ways. Joining an affiliate network is a good starting point. These connect you to publishers who might want to promote your product and take care of the technical side. You only pay a small setup fee and share commissions only if you get paid first. Each affiliate network is unique, so make sure to do some research on them before you sign up. Pro TipYou can also find potential affiliates by looking for those who promote your competitors. Here‚Äôs how:Enter the competitor‚Äôs site into Ahrefs‚Äô Site Explorer.Go to the Backlinks report.Filter for backlinks that contain any of these popular affiliate URL parameters in the Target URL: ?ref, ?clid, ?id.Filter for One link per domain.Sort the results by Domain traffic.Look for affiliates in the Referring page column. 5. Let happy customers create more happy customers with user generated contentUser-generated content (UGC) is any form of content, such as reviews, photos, videos, or social media posts, created by consumers rather than by the brand itself. This marketing tactic leverages the authentic experiences of existing customers to build trust and credibility. And it works because customers are likely to trust other customers. You can encourage UGC by running contests or asking for short testimonials. Then, you can share it on your social media, landing pages, and newsletters and use it for all sorts of campaigns. Here, you can see the idea in action. Pakker Trousers uses UGC in all of its channels. Below is their website‚Äôs footer and a screenshot from their Instagram feed (real customers, no models).The beauty of UGC is that it requires minimal work; you‚Äôre essentially letting your satisfied customers do the marketing for you. This enriches your brand‚Äôs content strategy and deepens engagement with your community.6. Appear as a guest on relevant podcasts to reach new listenersThis tactic involves identifying podcasts whose listeners align with your target market, then reaching out to the hosts with a compelling pitch for your appearance. As a guest, you have the opportunity to share your expertise, discuss your products or services, and provide value to the podcast‚Äôs audience.This approach can help you build relationships within your industry, increase brand awareness, and potentially drive interested listeners to your website or social media channels.If you‚Äôve got an interesting story to tell or a topic you‚Äôre an expert on, you can do marketing for your brand by just talking about it. Just like my colleague Patrick Stox, who‚Äôs done some many of these that he doesn‚Äôt even need to pitch podcast hosts anymore.Just had an amazing conversation with these two wonderful humans and tech SEOs about SEO auditing large websites! Stay tuned for the next @crawlingmondays about with thee one and only @Jammer_Volts and @patrickstox üôåü§© Subscribe now: https://t.co/stghAaIEsc pic.twitter.com/qi4hne8suI‚Äî Aleyda Solis üïäÔ∏è (@aleyda) March 27, 2023 But before that happens, here‚Äôs what you can do:Target shows that align with your expertise.Start with smaller podcasts to gain experience.Send a clear email outlining your value to the show.If you don‚Äôt hear back, send a polite follow-up within two weeks.After appearing, promote the episode on your platforms to benefit both you and the host.You probably won‚Äôt have trouble finding shows to pitch through Google, Apple podcasts, Spotify podcasts, or curated lists you‚Äôll stumble across. But here‚Äôs what you also can do:Ask your network for any good shows they‚Äôve seen or watched lately.Use matchmaking services like PodcastGuest or Podmatch.Use SparkToro to see where your audience hangs out. You can find shows directly through YouTube or podcast criteria or see which influencers host their own shows. 7. Get free media coverage by helping journalists with their storiesHARO, which stands for Help A Reporter Out, is a service that connects journalists with sources for their stories (there are also alternatives like Help a B2B Writer or SourceBottle). This tactic involves regularly checking journalists‚Äô queries and responding to relevant opportunities where you can provide expert insights or commentary.By participating, you have the chance to be quoted or featured in various media, from niche industry publications to major news sites. This approach can help you gain credibility, increase your visibility, and potentially earn valuable backlinks to your website.While it requires consistent effort and quick responses, HARO offers a cost-effective way to get media coverage without the expense of hiring a PR firm. It‚Äôs important to note that not every pitch will result in coverage, but consistent, high-quality responses can lead to valuable media opportunities over time.To illustrate, here‚Äôs the journalist‚Äôs query on HARO:And here‚Äôs the answer published on handicappedpets.com with the link to the author‚Äôs site. All you need to do is sign up for HARO, monitor the requests in your category, and respond with valuable information as fast as possible whenever you see a good opportunity.Want a few tips from our experience with this tactic?Avoid publications that aren‚Äôt authoritative. Only respond to requests where you can truly provide great information.Don‚Äôt deviate from the format the author is requesting.Don‚Äôt hesitate to bring colleagues on board if they‚Äôre more qualified to answer.Further readingHow to Use HARO (And Alternatives) to Get Killer Backlinks8. Reuse your content across different platforms to maximize reachContent repurposing is the practice of adapting existing content into different formats or for different platforms to maximize its reach and impact.If you already have content that‚Äôs performing well, you can repurpose it for other marketing channels. This allows you to reach new audiences without creating something from scratch.Here‚Äôs an example. Our SEO checklist video has more than 230k views:But we also published it as an article that drives an estimated 9.5k clicks from organic search every month:Data via Ahrefs.There is more than one way to do it. Learn more in our list of 13 ways to repurpose content.Before you set up your first campaign, check our 6 tips for Google Search Ads. 9. Get featured in curated lists in your nicheMany people look for solutions on Google, be it a new tool they can use for work or service to get something done. For instance, ‚Äúmarketing tools‚Äù is a phrase that gets 3.2k searches each month. What people find this way is typically curated lists. Of course, getting featured in them all would be perfect ‚Äî but that can be challenging for newcomers. But here‚Äôs a tip: try to pitch to the more specific lists. Yes, these will be less popular, but that may actually work to your advantage:People looking for something specific are usually closer to making a purchase. Tools that cater to a very specific audience are harder to find; you‚Äôre basically helping out the authors of those lists. Get featured in some of those lists, and the next thing you know, you will be featured in more and more lists organically. You can use a keyword tool like Ahrefs‚Äô Keywords Explorer and study how people may be looking for a product/service like yours. Enter the type of your product or service.Go to the Matching terms report. Open the Clusters by Parent Topic tab (this will help to organize your keyword results).Find parent topics that fit the functionality of your product. Once you find a good topic, click on the SERP button to see which sites rank - these will be your prospects to pitch. To illustrate, here are some tool niches I found this way. Naturally, you won‚Äôt need to tick all of the boxes, just find a few that make sense for your business. Something that can help get featured is helping the content creator do their homework:Make it clear why their audience needs to hear about your product/service.Show them you‚Äôre the real deal. Show user testimonials, links to sites where you‚Äôve already been featured, mention VCs that backed you‚Ä¶ you get the idea. Give them a kit full of pictures, videos, and details about your product. If you can, offer to hop on a call and do a live demo. 10. Start a newsletter you‚Äôd like to get yourselfMany businesses send email newsletters, but their newsletters are boring and provide little value. At the same time, newsletters are undergoing a renaissance, which proves that people like to get newsletters ‚Äî just not bad ones. So start a newsletter, but don‚Äôt send out boring self-promotional company news week after week. Instead: Make it personable and fun.Share useful stuff from others, not just your company.If you‚Äôre linking to other sites, give a quick overview of the content; don‚Äôt just send links. And we talk from experience here. We‚Äôre a B2B brand, but every Ahrefs‚Äô Digest kicks off with a meme:We then group ‚Äúnews‚Äù by topic and write a quick blurb for each to save people time:That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs simple, but our readers love it. @ahrefs is really the only marketing newsletter you need today. https://t.co/aifL2f7nUg ‚Äî Gaetano (@gaetano_nyc) July 20, 2021You can start for free with tools like Mailchimp or ConvertKit, and it‚Äôs less technically complicated than you think. But to send out your first email, you need to start building your list. Here‚Äôs how. 11. Convert visitors into leads with lead magnets A lead magnet is a marketing tactic where a brand offers a free resource (ebook, tool, discount, etc.) in exchange for a visitor‚Äôs contact information. The goal is to convert anonymous website visitors into identifiable leads that you can nurture through your marketing funnel.Effective lead magnets address specific problems or interests of your target audience, providing immediate value while showcasing your expertise. Common examples include ebooks, whitepapers, webinars, free trials, or exclusive discounts. For instance, this lead magnet offers a time-saving set of press release templates:Once that company collects the email, they can start a conversation. Now, some people will get what they want and unsubscribe. But some will stay and read the next emails. Out of that group, some will be interested in checking out what you offer ‚Äî and some will eventually become your customers. When creating lead magnets, make sure not to go it alone. There are tools that will help you create the magnet itself, create a lead capture form, and distribute your freebie.Further readingLead Magnets Explained: Definition, Basics & 17 Examples 12. Speak at industry events to build authoritySpeaking at industry events is a powerful way to establish yourself or your company as an authority in your field. This tactic involves identifying relevant conferences, trade shows, or seminars, and proposing to present on topics where you have expertise. As a speaker, you have the opportunity to directly engage with your target audienceThe key is to offer something useful and engaging to encourage people to explore your products or services further. Think insights, case studies, or original research.This tactic needs less ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù than you may think. All you need is a few contextual mentions of your brand, no more, so don‚Äôt overdo it. 13. Write articles for other websites in your field to gain exposureGuest posting is when you publish content on another website.You‚Äôre giving away good content, but in return, you get: Brand exposure to someone else‚Äôs audience. A backlink. New connections in the industry.A bit of referral traffic. If there‚Äôs a website you love that you want to pitch, go for it. Even if they don‚Äôt say they take guest posts, they might be interested in what you‚Äôve got. But to make the best out of this tactic, prioritize sites that get traffic from Google (an indication they‚Äôre potentially quality sites) and are open to featuring new writers in the field. You can find these sites with Ahrefs‚Äô Content Explorer. Enter a broad keyword or phrase related to your niche. If you‚Äôd like to use more than one, separate them with the OR operator. Select In title from the drop-down menu.Set the Domain Rating filter to ‚Äú30 to 80‚Äù, website traffic from 20,000, and Only live mode. You can also set the preferred language. Run the search.On the results page, exclude homepages and subdomains. Then open the Websites tab.Finally, pitch your idea. That will be the hardest part of the entire process, but lucky for you, we‚Äôve done a fair bit of guest blogging, and we‚Äôre sharing our lessons in this guide to guest blogging for SEO. 14. Ask happy customers to leave a review on Google Reviews in your Google Business Profile (GBP) can help you rank higher in Google Maps and ‚Äúmap pack‚Äù results in Google search. Google relies on them to determine local ranking, and they‚Äôre one of the strongest local ranking factors, to our knowledge. So, for example, people looking for a local vet will first discover recommended GBPs.But here‚Äôs the thing about reviews. You can encourage them, but you should never pay for them. And it‚Äôs probably not a good idea to incentivize reviews with prizes, discounts, etc. So step 1: provide great service. You‚Äôre not going to get positive reviews unless you do this.Step 2: remind customers to leave a review. Kindly. You can put a QR code with a special link in visible places like your receipts, packaging, email, chats, or even put up a hand-made sign like this one: Very simple means to get reviews, but it works. I actually left a review after seeing this.15. Update old content to rank higher and get more traffic Updating existing content is a strategic approach to improve search engine rankings and increase website traffic without constantly producing new material. This tactic involves revisiting and refreshing older blog posts, articles, or web pages to ensure they remain relevant, accurate, and search engine optimized.Old content may lose rankings in Google for reasons that are often easy to fix. For example, when we refreshed our article on SEO statistics, we jumped in rankings and got more organic traffic, as shown in the screenshot below. Why? Simple. People wanted up-to-date statistics. Data via Ahrefs.But the question is, how do you find content that‚Äôs ripe for a refresh in the first place?Enter your site into Ahrefs‚Äô Site Explorer.Go to Opportunities and open the Content with declining traffic report.Data via Ahrefs.You will see pages that have lost the most traffic in the last six months and could likely use a refresh. Read our guide to republishing content to learn how to do that.Final thoughts These tactics are one of the easiest, but they‚Äôre still a lot of work. So here‚Äôs how you can go through that list and stay sane:Treat them as ideas. You don‚Äôt need to do all of them, and you don‚Äôt need to use them all at once.Start with the ones that make the most sense for your business. If you‚Äôve already tried any of those tactics and it didn‚Äôt work before, see the guides we recommended - maybe they‚Äôll help you look at the problem with fresh eyes.Once you start seeing results, start scaling and/or outsourcing.
