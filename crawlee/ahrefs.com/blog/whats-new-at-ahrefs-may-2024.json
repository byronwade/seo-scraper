The darker the color, the more content changes were made on a page that day.For example, this square on Jan 8 is a deep green. Clicking it shows you the exact things that have changed on this page – in this case, a huge content update.How far back in time you can see here depends on your Ahrefs plan’s limits. New use cases in Opportunities report We’ve added two new use cases in the Opportunities report: Potential cannibalization and descriptive anchors.Potential cannibalization helps you to spot cannibalization issues so you can consider consolidating pages that may be targeting the same page.Descriptive anchors helps you to spot instances where you can replace generic anchors like “read more”, “click here”, etc with more descriptive ones. Lowest DR filter in Organic keywordsRemember the Lowest DR filter in Keywords Explorer that lets you filter through high-difficulty keywords where a low-DR website ranks at the top? We’ve now added that to the Organic keywords report in Site Explorer as well.This should make it easier to spot opportunities where you can rank with a low-DR website.Keywords ExplorerBetter keywords selectionYou can now use checkboxes to select up to 10 thousand keywords. Your selection is kept when you switch pages or sort by any metric, but will reset if you apply any filters.From here, you can add your selected keywords to a list or project , or mass-update SERPs for them.

Now, you can select any two crawls for comparison.For example, you can compare a recent crawl for your website to a crawl back in, say, January. Click on the organic traffic changes column to sort your results and quickly find pages with significant traffic drops during this time.Or, go to All issues to track how you’ve been dealing with technical issues on your site since then.Rank TrackerNew widgets in GSC Overview reportWe’ve added a bunch of new widgets to the GSC Overview report:Top keywordsTop keyword changesLow hanging fruit keywords, which shows you the most popular keywords where your target’s ranking position is between 4 and 15Potential cannibalization, which shows you keywords with multiple ranking URLsTop pagesTop page changes Nested keyword tables in Pages 2.0 reportIn the Pages 2.0 report, you can now click to open nested keyword tables – this will show you all the keywords your target is ranking for.GeneralNew APIv3 endpoint: Rank Tracker OverviewWe’ve just released our first Rank Tracker APIv3 endpoint for Overview 2.0.
