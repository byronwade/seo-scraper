In this article, we will look at the top eight traffic analysis tools, what we like about them, and some tips on how to get the most out of each tool. You need different tools depending on whether you want insights into your own traffic or someone else’s. If it’s the latter, head to the sixth tool on the list (using our sidebar). Contents1. Google AnalyticsProbably the most used and best-known traffic analysis tool available, Google Analytics is a tool that probably every website owner should be using.It can track acquisition reports to find out how users get to the site, audience reports to better tailor experiences to different groups, and conversion reports to keep an eye on goals or events.It also offers real-time tracking so viewers can see how many active users there are.BenefitsSome of the top things we like about Google Analytics include:Managing more than one property under a single account.Extensive reporting on traffic, engagement, and conversions.Allowing for audience segmentation for Google Ads remarketing campaigns.How to use itFirst, sign up for a Google Analytics account (if you don’t have one).You need to add the tracking code for Google Analytics to your website. This code will collect data about the individuals visiting your website and then send it to the account you have set up for Google Analytics.Google Analytics will begin collecting data about your website as soon as the tracking code is installed and activated on the site.One of the most useful (but often underutilized) detailed reports in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the Path Exploration Overview.Go to Explore > Path Exploration.This is a custom report (you’ll need to set it to use it in a way that works best for you), but it can be extremely useful!The report allows you to see the specific path users take to get to specified URLs on your website. Or what’s often more helpful—review a reverse path, i.e., see how users got to a specific conversion point, for example. PricingGoogle Analytics is 100% free. Yet, its features still manage to rival a number of premium tools. Further readingHow to Use Google Analytics 4 for Beginners2. Google Search ConsoleOne of the most widely used and essential traffic analysis tools is Google Search Console. It is a free service provided by Google that allows website owners to monitor and optimize their sites’ visibility in search engine results.It lets you see the number of clicks, impressions, average position, and click-through rate (CTR) for each page on your website.BenefitsProvides detailed data on organic clicks, impressions, and click-through rate (CTR)Allows you to identify and fix technical issues that could be affecting your website’s performance in the SERPsShows the keywords that are driving traffic to your website with their search volume and positionsHow to use itFirst, sign in to Search Console with your Google account.You should see a “welcome” message with two options. Select the first one, then enter your domain or subdomain (without the http(s)://).Lastly, verify your domain, and Search Console will start gathering data.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXVEb_eklhkOne of the best things about Google Search Console (in terms of analyzing traffic) is that you can see which of your pages are losing traffic. That means you know which pages are a priority when it comes to updating and optimizing your content.You can do this by going to the Performance report, then adding a date range comparison to see stats for the past six months compared to the previous six months. Turn off “Impressions,” as you only need to focus on clicks; then click on “Pages.”Sort the report by “Clicks Difference” in ascending order to see the pages with the biggest traffic drops.Further readingHow to Use Google Search Console to Improve SEO (Beginner’s Guide)PricingGoogle Search Console is also completely free. 3.

For example, here are Similarweb’s traffic metrics for a new testing site I have:Now here are the same metrics in GA4:As you can see, the numbers in Similarweb are significantly overestimated.
