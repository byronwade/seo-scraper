Impressions shows you the number of searches that your target receives for keywords that it ranks for in the top 10.Share of Voice & Share of Traffic Value chartsWe’ve also added two incredibly useful charts in Overview – you’ll see them when using Competitors mode.The first one, Share of Voice, shows your target’s organic search market share over time as compared to the competitors you’ve specified.The second, Share of Traffic Value, shows the same but instead of traffic, it focuses on the total paid cost of that traffic.You can use these charts as a great starting point for analysis and reporting.For example, we can see that bestbees.com have focused on organic search from a while ago and have taken significant organic market share over time.Keywords ExplorerAI translationsYou can now use AI to translate a saved keyword list into various languages and dialects.Just open any saved keyword list and click on THIS Translate button.
