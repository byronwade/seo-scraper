That’s likely due to the audience we surveyed.Still, you don’t need to subscribe to all these newsletters. In the end, execution is what matters. Read too many newsletters, and you’ll end up with analysis paralysis. It’s better to subscribe to the few you find most interesting to keep updated on what’s happening and get new marketing ideas to try.Lastly, we also have a newsletter. Each week, we send links to our new blog posts and videos, and articles that we found interesting.
