This helps you to visualize if significant changes in traffic followed a change in content. The bigger the bubble, the bigger the content change. For example, here we can see that for this blog post, each overhaul change in content was soon followed by a spike in organic traffic. Click on View changes to open Page inspect and see how the actual content changed.Content changes in Top pages When you compare changes for a page in Top pages, you’ll now also see how drastically content on the page changed during this time. Click on the magnifying glass to see actual changes in Page inspect. Target URL filter improvementsWe’ve improved the behavior of the Target URL filter when it comes to redirect chains. Before, you could only search for redirect chains based on the final destination URL. But now, we’ve changed it so that you can filter for all the URLs in a redirect chain.Referring IPs revampYou can now:Use “Best links” and other filtersSee new and lost IPs for any timeframeSee nested domains and link tablesOrganic competitorsWhen you select domains, you can now open them directly in the new Content gap and Link intersect reports.The “Open in” menu is also available in:The Top organic competitors widget in OverviewAll SERP overviews with selectable resultsKeywords ExplorerNew Growth metricGrowth shows you a keyword’s search volume growth rate over 3, 6, or 12 months – you can select your time period with the switcher at the top.You can also filter for keywords that had a specific growth rate over a time period and sort results by growth.Finally, we’ve added a column picker so you can show or hide metrics.Available on: Advanced plans and higher.Rank TrackerIn Overview 2.0, you can now customize the columns you see for metrics like clicks, CPC, search types, and Parent Topic.We’ve also added a date picker in SERP overview.Finally, you can click on tags in all Rank Tracker reports to open up that tag group in Overview 2.0.
