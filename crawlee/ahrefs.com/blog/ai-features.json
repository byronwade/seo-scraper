Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents Can Ahrefs be a reliable AI copilot for SEO? Absolutely! Meet our latest AI features designed to boost your productivity by automating keyword research, content optimization, and technical SEO processes.Let’s dive in. 1. AI keyword suggestions Brainstorming keyword ideas can be challenging. New website entrants are fighting for long-tail keyword scraps, while established brands face saturation with popular search terms.Ahrefs’ built-in AI suggestions in Keywords Explorer can quickly kickstart your keyword research from a list of lateral keywords.Just click on the Ask AI search bar and choose from the available presets. I’ll go with “challenges and pain points” for a common keyword like “marketing”.Our AI keyword assistant will then brainstorm a list of common challenges faced across various types of marketing activities.The best part? This works with other languages too. Just make sure to type in the desired language at the end of the query, choose the location, and hit search. 2. AI search intent Search intent – the reason behind a search query – is often obvious (transactional in this case).For queries with multiple intents or unclear ones, AI can help analyze the different types of search intents and show what content angles to tackle next.Let’s take the keyword “calligraphy”, scroll all the way down to the SERP Overview table in Keywords Explorer, and click the Identify intents button.In addition to more granular user intents, our SERP AI will break down the percentage of total traffic that goes to each one of them – something no other SEO tool can do at the moment!Use them as hints as to what content angles you can use to rank.For example, we could go all-in on targeting the “calligraphy” keyword with a definitional article about the history and types of calligraphy.Or even better, target multiple search intents with just one comprehensive article, covering all dominant intents in the recommended proportions:55% - Definition and background information34% - Learning calligraphy11% - Calligraphy supplies 3. AI content grading Another SEO process you can streamline with AI is content optimization. More specifically, finding missing topics to cover for improved search performance.How? Our AI Content Grader (currently in beta for Enterprise users) automatically analyzes the top ranking pages for an existing article and keyword.It then extracts all the main subtopics, compares them side-by-side, and scores them on a scale to show you how well (or bad) you’ve covered them.Here’s an example for the keyword “programmatic SEO”, comparing one of our articles with its rival incumbents. This should paint a clear picture of what exact areas require content improvements.AI Content Grader also shows you suggestions on how to best cover the subtopic, word-for-word, by providing a real-life example from a top-ranking page.OUT IN BETA: AI CONTENT HELPER If you want to level-up your content optimization game, try our latest AI Content Helper.This is a more natural content optimization tool, that focuses on topic coverage rather than keyword stuffing (as most tools do).Just like the content grader, content helper will identify the core topics for your target keyword, then score your content (and your competitors’) against it as you write it.In addition, you can also use AI to brainstorm title tags, meta descriptions, and headings. And pretty soon, automate internall inks to boost your content’s authortiy.AI Content Helper is free while in beta, so take it for a spin and let us know how we can improve it 4. AI translations If you do international SEO, translating keywords for regional markets should be a top priority.The process is not that easy though. You’ll need to:Compile a keyword list with SEO metricsHire experienced translatorsTranslate keywords and make sure their localized nuances are preserved (a process called transcreation)Create a content plan based on the translated keywordsAhrefs’ AI translator can do all these at once, saving you time (and translator fees) to scale your content strategy globally.Start from a saved keyword list, choose a preferred language or dialect followed by the keyword location, and hit “Translate”.What sets it apart from other translation management tools is that you’ll get translated alternatives of each keyword, so you can choose the version with the highest keyword search volume.For example, there’s a bunch of different ways to say “popcorn” across Spanish-speaking countries. Our AI translator is able to detect the most popular variation in each country.NOTE Ahrefs AI translator currently offers automatic translations for 40+ languages and dialects in 180+ countries, with more coming soon. 5. AI technical SEO (coming soon) Wouldn’t it be great if you could fix technical issues on your website, without asking developers for help?Soon, you’ll be able to do that with Patches.Patches are fixes that you can create and push by yourself in any of Site Audit’s reports.For example, if an SEO crawl flags your website for too short meta descriptions, you can address the issue yourself. Instead of exporting data, writing a support ticket, and sending it to IT with the appropriate fixes, you could:Click on “Patch it”Enter a new meta descriptionAnd publish it on your websiteAll changes will be pushed live via CloudFlare workers or JavaScript snippets, which means we’ll handle the whole backend so you can focus on the big picture.Cool story bro, but where’s AI? In upcoming iterations, you’ll be able to ask AI for help with menial SEO tasks like rewriting titles and meta descriptions, speeding up your workflow even more. Free Ahrefs AI features Most of the AI features mentioned so far can be accessed directly within Ahrefs’ interface, as long as you have a new Standard plan or higher (AI Content Grader is available only for Enterprise customers).Additionally, we have 40+ free AI writing tools as part of the Ahrefs ecosystem.These tools are primarily designed for copywriting, generating content on the fly in various tones and for various purposes, like SEO, content marketing, social media, and even product-related tasks.We’ve also got our own Word Counter, which use AI to help you extract keywords and entities out of a paragraph for SEO purposes.That’s a wrap! We hope these features really help you streamline your SEO tasks with the right kind of AI insights.What other AI features would you like us to add next?
