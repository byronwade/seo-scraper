Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents In early 2018, we released Ahrefs‚Äô Site Audit tool. Since then, we‚Äôve added tons of new features that we never announced outside of our private Facebook group.That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this post. I want to let you know about all the new features that you might have missed. Features that make your SEO audits more insightful and actionable than ever!Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what we‚Äôre about to cover:Site structureURL InfoSegmentsPresets for filtersData filters for the previous crawl‚ÄúShow changes‚Äù switch in Data ExplorerImproved outgoing links exportMultiple seed sourcesRedirect chain issuesEnhanced issue details and ‚ÄúHow to fix‚Äù instructionsHints for Data Explorer fieldsLet‚Äôs dive straight in.1. Site structureThe Site Structure report is the latest addition to our Site Audit tool.It shows the subdomains and subfolders of your site in a tree view. But most importantly, this report displays the distribution of HTTP status codes, link depth, estimated organic traffic, referring domains and more for each subsection of your website.You can use this report to find the subsections of your website which:Attract the most backlinks from unique websites (referring domains)Have the most broken and redirected pagesAre underperforming in terms of organic trafficAre furthest from the homepage (or another seed page)Have the most or least indexable contentYou can also toggle between the table view and chart view. The latter will come in handy for your client reports.2. URL InfoClick on any URL in Site Audit to see all the data that our crawler collected for that URL.This report is not limited to on-page data such as title, description, content length, indexability, canonicalization, etc. It also gives you quick access to the URL‚Äôs inlinks (internal links to the page), internal outlinks, external outlinks, hreflang tags, duplicates, and so much more!3. SegmentsSegmentation was one of the most popular feature requests from our users, and I can see why.Most website owners and SEOs want to isolate issues related to a specific section of a site, such as /blog, /store/, or perhaps a subdomain like es.ahrefs.com.So we added the ability to configure a segment, save it, and then return to it at any time with just a few clicks.To do this, hit Segment > Configure segment Here‚Äôs a quick example:Sidenote. The segment is applied to every report in Site Audit. If you manage a big website and did not know about this handy feature, go and segment your crawls right now. üòâ4. Presets for filtersA preset is a set of filters for Data Explorer. It allows you to focus in on a predetermined subset of URLs quickly.We have added 40+ presets in Site Audit to save you time.Now, it takes only a few seconds to apply a preset for:3XX redirects4XX broken URLsNon-indexable pagesExternal URLsPDF filesand moreYou can combine these presets, edit them as you like, and even save your own.Let us know in the comments if you come up with any useful and creative filter combinations!5. Data filters for the previous crawlSpeaking of filters‚Ä¶Have you noticed this small switch in the filters section?You can use this to filter URLs based on their values from the previous crawl (as long as you have more than one crawl in your project).How is this useful?Imagine that you crawled a website with Site Audit and found a bunch of 404 URLs. You tasked your developers with fixing any broken internal links on your website by removing the links or redirecting the dead (404) URLs. And today, you want to check if there are any broken links left.Here‚Äôs what you can do:Run a new crawl and apply the following filters to see which URLs are still returning the 404 HTTP status code:How cool is that!?6. ‚ÄúShow changes‚Äù switch in Data ExplorerSince we touched on previous crawls, you‚Äôll be glad to know that you can now see what changed between the previous and current crawl for any URL.Just hit the ‚ÄúShow changes‚Äù button in the report.You can see the change for every column in Data Explorer. And, as you know, the columns here are adjustable.Here‚Äôs a quick use case:Say you asked your co-worker to update some page descriptions. Now you want to see if they did it. Simply run a new crawl, go to Data Explorer, add the Description column to the table, and see if there is any change on the website.This simple switch also allows you to track changes in the number of incoming or outgoing links, monitor the size of the page or resource, and many other things.It‚Äôs super handy for client reports.7. Improved outgoing links exportCustomer feedback told us that the outgoing links export in Data Explorer was not well-formatted for further processing.So we added specific exports for outgoing links where every outgoing link has a row of its own in the exported .csv file.8. Multiple seed sourcesEvery crawl in Ahrefs Site Audit has a starting point or points that we call seeds. As our crawler finds links on seed pages, it follows them and crawls the linked pages.You can tell our crawler where to start crawling your website from. The options include:the URL generated from the ‚ÄúScope‚Äù fieldSitemap(s)a custom list of URLsURLs with external backlinks according to AhrefsYou can select just one seed or use many seeds when you set up a new crawl.9. Redirect chain issuesRedirects are an integral part of many websites. Single 301 redirects are of no harm to your site performance.However, redirect chains always require attention.So we‚Äôve added two new errors.Redirect chain:And Redirect loop:It‚Äôs generally recommended to get rid of redirect chains on your site. However, as long as the number of redirects in the chain is below five, it‚Äôs not so critical.Redirect loops, however, require immediate attention. They are like ‚Äútraps‚Äù for crawlers and users alike.In Site Audit, when you click through to the list of affected URLs, you‚Äôll see that each of these reports gives you all the data you need about the redirect chain, including:the first redirecting URLthe URLs in the chain, andthe final destination URL10. Enhanced issue details and ‚ÄúHow to fix‚Äù instructionsWe know that merely reporting SEO issues is not enough. It is equally important to explain how to fix these issues and why.For that reason, we‚Äôve improved our issue descriptions and ‚Äúhow to fix‚Äù instructions to make fixing issues easier than ever. And where short descriptions in the interface don‚Äôt go deep enough, we‚Äôve added a link to a more detailed article in our Help section:11. Hints for Data Explorer fieldsIn Data Explorer, you can view and filter for issues relating to more than two-hundred data points. Many of these fields are pretty straightforward, but we felt that some needed a better explanation.So now, you can mouse-over any field to see an explanatory hint:Final thoughtsAs you can see, we‚Äôre continually improving our tools.If you have suggestions or feature requests for our Site Audit tool, you‚Äôre welcome to share them here. Your feedback drives our product development.Right now, we are working on a couple of major updates to our Site Audit tool. I won‚Äôt tell you what they are, but you‚Äôre going to love them, I promise! So stay tuned.How do you like the new features? Let us know in the comments below!
