Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents Online marketing communities are excellent places to gain fresh perspectives, stay on the pulse of trends, learn from seasoned marketers and founders, and have watercooler conversations with like-minded folk.But with the wealth of groups to choose from, finding the right one to join can be overwhelming if you’re new to the space.To help, we joined some popular marketing communities and cherry-picked our favorites.Here’s what made the cut, in no particular order:Demand CurveSwipe FilesWomen in Tech SEO (WTS)r/marketingThe Marketing Meetup (TMM)Dave Gerhardt Marketing Group (DGMG) Superpath1. Demand CurveCommunity type: Slack community Who it’s for: Experienced growth marketers, startup founders, consultants Cost: Free (Apply for an invite) Sign-up link: Website Member count: ~3k (free community); >30k (newsletter + marketing course)Demand Curve is a Y Combinator-backed company that supports startups through its biweekly newsletter, playbooks, and programs. Its free private Slack group comprises mostly experienced marketers, many of whom are founders of—or growth leads at—tech companies including Microsoft and Zendesk.The brains behind Demand Curve are experts themselves: founder Julian Shapiro is an active angel investor whose open-source work has been featured in Forbes, while co-founders Justin Setzer and Neal O’Grady previously held growth roles at Grammarly and customer data platform Segment, respectively.Within the community are 17 channels that dive into topics such as #analytics-and-data, #b2b, #product-and-marketing, and #fb-ig-ads. The well-organized space makes it all the easier to search for information or get help from the right people, and while discussions can get fairly technical, responses are often timely and insightful. For instance, you might find questions on influencer marketing tactics in #ecom-and-influencers, and discussions on email newsletter sponsorships in #growth-strategy.2. Swipe FilesCommunity type: Circle, a community platform Who it’s for: B2B marketers and entrepreneurs Cost: From US$99/year for access to the private community (includes 7-day free trial) Sign-up link: Website Member count: >500 (paid); >6.3k (free newsletter)Founded by Corey Haines—a marketer and podcaster who formerly led the Growth arm at Baremetrics—Swipe Files focuses mainly on marketing, growth and audience-building, with the purpose of building friendships, not leads.For a taste of what to expect, start with the free weekly newsletter or take the 7-day trial to unlock free access to the private community. Discussions are split into 11 channels, including General, Learning, Wins, Asks, Challenges, and Gigs.I particularly like how friendly the community is: Haines personally welcomes new members and actively engages in discussions across all channels, while members primarily discuss SaaS-related or B2B marketing topics. Free-flow conversations also take place in the Not Marketing channel.Beyond the community, be sure to use the repository of marketing resources on the main website, which includes a master swipe file of over 1,000 ideas for marketers to take notes from.3. Women in Tech SEO (WTS)Community type: Facebook group and Slack community Who it’s for: Women in the technical SEO space Cost: Free Sign-up link: Facebook, Slack Member count: >2.7k (Facebook); >1.7k (Slack)Women-only online communities aren’t exactly new territory these days, but they sure are in the marketing world. Areej AbuAli was quick to fill this gap when she founded Women in Tech SEO (WTS) in 2019. As its name suggests, WTS aims to encourage women in the technical SEO space to help each other, no matter their career stage.The official website offers followers a slew of resources, including blog posts, podcasts, and weekly interviews with women in the industry. For a little more help, though, try the Facebook group or Slack community.The latter comprises 24 channels, which give members answers to specific questions on everything from #content-seo and #analytics to #technical-seo, #schema, and #cms. What I like is the community’s enthusiasm in exchanging knowledge and showing their support through emoji reactions. Threads that attract the most engagement are often from founder AbuAli, who posts weekly announcements and updates on WTSWorkshop talks.Over on Facebook, expect up to five posts a day—with discussions centering on SEO strategy, basic SEO tactics, and the more technical stuff like hreflang tags or Google Search Console.You’ll also find occasional job postings and sharings on success stories, and from what I’ve gathered, the community’s a supportive and helpful one. That’s a plus in our books.4. r/marketingCommunity type: Subreddit Who it’s for: Anyone interested in marketing and advertising Cost: Free Sign-up link: Reddit Member count: >365kIf I could choose one go-to community for timely, useful, and basic marketing advice, it’d be this subreddit.Unlike most groups, having a Reddit account is the only prerequisite for joining the community, making it a more accessible platform to bounce ideas off professionals or seek career advice on thriving as a marketer.With over 360,000 members—comprising business owners, agency folk, and aspiring or seasoned marketers—there’s a whole lot to learn, given the breadth and depth of topics discussed and the fact that community engagement is high. While the content admittedly isn’t so well-moderated, you’ll quickly find answers to questions on all things SEO, content and brand marketing, media planning, and UX/UI, to name several.There’re a host of resources worth checking out, too, all of which can be found on its pinned content board. And if you’re looking for a similar community that’s a little more niche, check these out:r/socialmedia (>179k members)r/SEO (>174k members)r/digital_marketing (>141k members)r/content_marketing (>89k members)r/BigSEO (>81k members)r/AskMarketing (>35k members)5. The Marketing Meetup (TMM)Community type: Facebook group and events Who it’s for: Marketers, freelancers, and entrepreneurs Cost: Free Sign-up link: Facebook and Events Member count: >2.7kA canteen in Cambridge, England, and a self-dubbed ‘nervous networker’: These were the ingredients that led to the birth of The Marketing Meetup (TMM) in 2016 when founder Joe Glover organized a casual event over food.What began as a marketing get-together has today evolved into an almost 25,000-strong community—and its members are treated to weekly online events that have featured the likes of Catherine Newman, Chief Marketing Officer at Manchester United, and Harry Dry, the brains behind newsletter favourite Marketing Examples.For more intimate discussions on all things marketing-related, turn to its Facebook community:Here, entry-level and experienced marketers exchange advice and recommendations on industry tools, career paths, and topics spanning content marketing, brand strategy, email marketing, and growing a business.One bonus: a monthly jobs thread for members looking to hire or be hired:I also like that TMM emphasizes and encourages positivity—something that its members respect and deliver on, from what I’ve gleaned.6. Dave Gerhardt Marketing Group (DGMG)Community type: Facebook group Who it’s for: B2B marketers Cost: US$10/month; cancel anytime (Once payment is complete, you’ll get an invite to join the private group via email) Sign-up link: Website Member count: >2.6kDave Gerhardt is something of a micro-influencer in the marketing space, and for good reason: He led growth at conversational marketing platform Drift from the time of its founding in 2015, went on to helm marketing efforts at SaaS tool Privy, then returned to Drift as Chief Branding Officer.Naturally, you’d expect the seasoned marketer to take things a step further—by making a brand of his name.The DGMG Facebook group comprises a small but helpful community of paying subscribers, many of whom are employees at Slack, TikTok, HubSpot, and more. So expect quality discussions and sharings on copy and content strategy to branding, social media, design (UI/UX), and recommendations for jobs, marketing books, and software.From time to time, Gerhardt weighs in on these discussions or shares marketing tips:One recent addition to the community that I like is the live masterclasses that members can participate in, with marketing-related topics selected based on votes.7. SuperpathCommunity type: Slack community Who it’s for: Content marketers and founders Cost: Free (Apply for an invite) Sign-up link: Airtable Member count: >3kYou know you’ve landed on something good when a marketing community has members from well-known tech companies, including Shopify, Udemy, Intercom, and HubSpot.It’s also no coincidence that Superpath was mentioned twice in response to our CMO Tim’s tweet on recommendations for marketing communities.Unlike most of the groups that made this list, Superpath focuses on content marketing—a topic about which founder Jimmy Daly honed his expertise through his years of experience at B2B SaaS companies. I’m a big fan of founders who make the extra effort to engage with the communities they’ve built regularly, and Daly does just that by sharing weekly updates on what he’s been up to, in-community discussions he found interesting, and updates on Superpath.Its members are likewise supportive and welcoming, with a good number of them actively offering detailed feedback to both new and experienced marketers.The community has 20 channels. That may sound excessive, but not in this case, considering the technical nature of discussions on channels like #seo-talk or #b2b-content-chat. Other notable channels are #writing-feedback, #watercooler, and #team-mgmt, the last of which discusses team structuring practices and talent retention.Final thoughtsThese aren’t the only marketing communities we love. We have yet more favorites that we didn’t include (including Ahrefs Insider, of course!) because we already mentioned them in these posts:11 Slack Communities for SEOs and Digital Marketers9 Best Marketing Groups on Facebook (to Level Up Your Skills)4 Best Facebook Groups for SEOs (Most Voted For)Finding the right community takes time, so patience is key.
