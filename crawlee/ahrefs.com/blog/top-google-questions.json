questions by growthMany popular questions don’t change from year to year. For example, people have been asking measurement-related questions since forever (e.g., ” how many cups in a gallon”). I ask that often too.But there are new questions, too. These are the questions that have seen the most growth recently.1. Who shot TrumpMonthly search volume: 188,000Change in search volume over the past 3 months: +73M%The spike in searches for this keyword was due to the assassination attempt on the former U.S president and then presumptive nominee of the Republican Party for the 2024 presidential election. Searches for this topic has dwindled since then.2. Where to watch summer olympic gamesMonthly search volume: 82,000Change in search volume over the past 3 months: +19M%The spike in searches was due to the 2024 Summer Olympics which was held in Paris. It concluded on 11 August 2024, which is why searches around this topic have died off since then.3. How to register to vote in the USMonthly search volume: 70,000Change in search volume over the past 3 months: +16M%The spike in searches is due to the upcoming 2024 United States presidential election. It is set to be held on November 5, 2024. I foresee searches will go the way of the Summer Olympics once the election concludes.4. How did rich homie quan dieMonthly search volume: 28,000Change in search volume over the past 3 months: +11M%Rich Homie Quan (real name: Dequantes Devontay Lamar) was an American rapper. The spike in searches was because Rich Homie Quan was found unconscious at home on September 5, 2024. His girlfriend told 911 that he was on the couch in the morning and had not moved when she returned home later. He was later pronounced dead at an Atlanta hospital on the same day at the young age of 34. An autopsy has been performed, but the cause of death is currently unknown.5. What is demureMonthly search volume: 23,000Change in search volume over the past 3 months: +5.6M%The word “demure” is an adjective that means “reserved, modest, and shy.” However, this particular spike was because of TikTok creator Jools Lebon. In a video that has now more than 30 million views, Jools used the phrase “very demure, very mindful” to describe herself. It went viral and many creators on social media started replicating the catchphrase in their own content.Looking at the dip in searches, it is likely that this trend is, like most Internet trends, merely temporary and will die off soon.How to find the most asked questions in your nicheHere’s how to find the most asked questions in your niche:Go to Keywords ExplorerEnter a relevant keywordGo to the Matching terms reportToggle the Questions tabFor example, if you search for “coffee”, you can see 142,000 questions which you could potentially create content for.Want to do keyword research for your site?
