A payout becomes “high ticket” once you reach above $100, but it can go as high as five figures.It’s a way for affiliate marketers to make more money from fewer sales.

However, your conversion rate will also typically be much lower.High-ticket products or services include things like:Courses or membershipsInsuranceLoansSoftwareMachineryJewelryElectronicsHeavy metalsHow much do high-ticket affiliate marketers make?We examined how much money affiliate marketers make and found that, on average, most affiliate marketers (~57%) make less than $10,000 per year.However, on the high end, 3.78% of affiliate marketers make over $150,000 per year, and an additional 7.94% of affiliates make $100,000–150,000 per year (according to a study done by the Influencer Marketing Hub).I can say that I have made over six figures per year from high-ticket affiliate sales, and I know several others who have done the same.The study above considers all affiliate income, so here are some examples of high-ticket affiliates.15 examples of high-ticket affiliate marketing programsWant to start making big commissions?

Let’s dive into how to make big payouts.1. Find a high-ticket affiliate program to promoteYou can find high-ticket affiliate programs through affiliate networks like AvantLink or Impact Radius, or try some of the examples above.You can also use Ahrefs’ Web Explorer to find affiliate program opportunities. Here’s how you do it.Start by navigating to Web Explorer and enter a high-ticket affiliate niche – I’ve chosen web hostingThen, add a Page URL filter that contains the phrase “affiliate-program”Hit search, and you’ll get something like the belowEven with this basic search, you can uncover random affiliate programs with over $100 commissions.If you want to take it further, you can experiment by adding more filters. In the example below, I’ve added a Page title filter to find keywords that mention “$ per” in the title.This gives us 363 potential affiliate programs to investigate that are likely to be high ticket.However, based on my experience, if you want the absolute highest-paying programs, they will typically be found through direct brand partnerships that aren’t always advertised.If you know of a high-ticket item or service you like and want to promote, consider contacting the company to discuss a partnership.Half the battle of succeeding in high-ticket affiliate marketing is finding a good product worth the high price. You need to believe in the product, which is where tip #2 comes in.2. Focus on building trust and authorityIt doesn’t take a genius to sell a $5 product on Amazon (not that there’s anything wrong with Amazon affiliate websites). But if you want someone to buy a product worth thousands on your recommendation, you need them to trust your advice.Trust is earned in several ways:Transparency – You’re legally required to have an affiliate disclaimer on your website. While you can hide it in the fine print, it’s better to be upfront about the fact that you are making a commission on sales.Honesty – If a product or service isn’t the best, tell people about it—even if the company pays you big bucks to say otherwise.A good about page – Tell your readers who you are and why they should trust you. Did you actually use the product? If you’re reviewing batteries, are you an electrician? Show off your qualifications. Better yet, have a video about your brand that shows your face. Let people know you’re a real person with real experience worth listening to.For example, here’s the About page for The Wanderful, where Scott shows his face and his dog and talks a bit about his expertise (living in a van full-time for five years).He also has some videos on his About page to show he knows what “van lifers” care about and why his products and recommendations are worth listening to.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URDqYGRux28&list=TLGGcq-8HLawuBMxMDAzMjAyMwNot only will these things help you sell expensive products, but it will also help with Google’s recent E-E-A-T update (experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trust). Signaling these attributes gives a better chance of ranking higher in Google’s search results.3. Build quality backlinks to signal E-E-A-T and rank higherMost successful affiliate marketers rely on search engines (mainly Google) to drive traffic to their websites and make conversions. And backlinks are one of the most important Google ranking factors that determine how well you rank for a given keyword.If we circle back to E-E-A-T, Gary Illyes from Google said that backlinks have a huge impact on E-A-T (the former version, excluding experience):https://twitter.com/Marie_Haynes/status/966325146968559616For example, here’s a link to a high-ticket affiliate site from Forbes that signals E-E-A-T:Screenshot taken from the Backlinks report in Ahrefs’ Site Explorer.If you don’t currently have a lot of good backlinks, here are some tactics you can use to start building more:Guest bloggingResource page link buildingHARO link building4. Invest in videoI believe that video builds more trust than words on a page; people trust you more if they can see your face and hands-on experience.This is true across the board. You can use video to promote products on social media, improve trust on your website, and even occupy multiple spots on the SERPs.Ahrefs has done this. Take a look at this SERP, for example: You can see that we were able to rank two pages for the keyword “learn seo”—once with our YouTube video on the topic and again with our blog post on how to learn SEO.But what about using video as an affiliate marketer?One of my favorite examples of a high-ticket affiliate marketer using video is Hobotech. He does in-depth reviews of electrical components like solar power stations and batteries.This video has received nearly half a million views. It promotes a $1,600 product with a 10% commission rate ($160 per sale):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp9ofdbqnUwHis videos aren’t the fanciest or highest-quality, and they’re long (30+ minutes).But he is very honest in his videos about what works and what doesn’t and whether or not he recommends you buy it. He goes on to explain things in layman’s terms and rigorously test the batteries, showing everything on camera with his expert feedback. He does a great job at building trust through video.5. Capture people at different stages of the funnelAs affiliate marketers, we often focus on commercial-intent keywords relating to product reviews or comparisons. However, when it comes to high-ticket items, these keywords are usually extremely competitive and difficult to rank for.Like the keyword “best health insurance,” which has a KD score of 80, according to Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer (meaning you’ll need a lot of backlinks to rank on page #1):Compare that with the keyword “can a doctor treat a family member and bill insurance,” which only has a KD of 1 (meaning you don’t need to care about backlinks to rank on page #1):In the long run, you’ll build more trust (both with your visitors and with Google) by spreading your content across the entire marketing funnel—i.e., publishing blog posts on topics from when people start being interested to when they’re ready to make a purchase decision.This way, you’ll also likely end up with more sales over time because you’re capturing people before they get to the buying research stage, allowing you to skip the competition entirely in some cases.For example, here are keywords someone might search for at different stages in the buyer’s journey while researching kayaks: In this case, you can get your brand in front of people long before they’re thinking about buying something. Not only does this build trust, but it also allows you to get these visitors into an email funnel that guides them through the journey from awareness to purchase.Covering all your bases is especially important for high-ticket items where the competition is fierce and there are fewer potential buyers.Research suggests it takes anywhere from 28 to 62 (or sometimes even more) “touchpoints” before someone will buy a product. A touchpoint is any time someone sees a brand, whether that’s on a billboard or your blog.The number of touchpoints can be even higher for more expensive items since people need more convincing before they buy.Of course, not all of the touches need to be done by you. If a company invests a lot in advertising, you only need to be one of the last touchpoints before someone buys in order to make the commission. Most of these affiliate programs have a 30-day or longer cookie.But the more touches you can contribute, the more sales you’ll ultimately make.That’s why, in addition to creating content for SEO, you should also grow an email list, be active on multiple social media platforms, and even consider running retargeting ads to get people back to your content so you can be the final touch before someone buys.The “stickier” your brand is on your followers, the higher the chance you’ll make that glorious high-ticket commission. Get your visitors to follow you on multiple channels and subscribe to your email list to stay at the top of their minds.What Is IMC? Integrated Marketing Communications Explained6. Only promote quality productsThis one’s simple—don’t try to trick people into buying expensive crap that won’t benefit them. It may work in the short term, but it will ruin that trust I keep talking about. If you want a serious long-term business, only promote products you find useful and worth the investment.7. Don’t be afraid to tell people not to buyYour product may not be for everyone. And by being honest about it, you will build more trust and have a higher conversion rate for the people the product will truly benefit.One of my favorite things about Hobotech, who I mentioned before, is that he will tell you NOT to buy the product he’s promoting or reviewing if it’s not a good fit for you.Take this video, for example. He mentions who it’s good for and who shouldn’t buy it.Final thoughtsHigh-ticket affiliate marketing offers higher earnings from fewer sales. Choosing a niche with pricey products can be very profitable.But to succeed, you must be honest, build trust with your audience by creating regular high-quality content, and show that you use the products or services yourself.
