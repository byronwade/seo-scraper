Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents What makes a good Facebook marketing group?To find out, I vetted over 35 of them based on the volume of activity in the group, the quality and relevance of the content, and how the admins and members engaged with each other.Before getting into the list, do remember that many marketing groups require you to answer some simple questions before your request is approved, such as what you hope to get from joining the community.Here are the 10 best Facebook marketing groups that made the list:Marketing SolvedSaaS Growth HacksCXL - Conversion Optimization, Analytics & GrowthSaaS Products & MarketingFacebook Ad HacksSisters in SEOGoogle SEM MastermindDumb SEO QuestionsLocal SEO Strategies & Google My Business Help with Tim KahlertSuperstar SEO1. Marketing SolvedFounder: Kat SullivanGroup type: PrivateTopics covered: General marketing, social media Ideal for: Beginners to experienced marketers, foundersMember count: 23.6KSign-up link: FacebookAre you in the social media space? Here’s a community for you to expand your network, grow your social media presence, and learn from some knowledgeable folks.Founder Kat Sullivan noticed that few Facebook group founders actively engaged with members and sought to fill the gap through Marketing Solved. Its main point of difference is its focus on connecting small-business owners and marketers with useful resources.From my observations, Kat is generous in sharing her experiences of working with entrepreneurs and brands. She’s also been featured in publications, including Inc., Entrepreneur, and Fast Company—and is the co-founder of social media management tool Tassi.In turn, members share a myriad of content, such as interesting marketing case studies, invitations to free marketing courses, and questions on entrepreneurship and monetizing online brands.As with most marketing groups I came across, self-promotions aren’t allowed unless they are on specific threads. These include Instagram Mondays and Pitch & Promote Your Biz (the latter happens at least once a month).2. SaaS Growth HacksFounder: Aaron KrallGroup type: PrivateTopics covered: Entrepreneurship, general marketing, conversion rate optimization (CRO), growth hacking Ideal for: Mid-level to experienced marketers, foundersMember count: 27.4K Sign-up link: FacebookJust like Kat’s Marketing Solved, SaaS Growth Hacks was conceived when founder Aaron Krall noticed the lack of a quality community for SaaS founders.As a SaaS conversion specialist, he’s helped convert expired trial users into paying customers through email nurture campaigns. Today, the Facebook group is an extension of Aaron’s experiences and includes the founders of established tech companies such as Intercom and AdEspresso.From what I’ve gleaned, its members are happy to share insights on how to start or scale a SaaS business, as well as improve or build better products.Other topics of discussion include growth strategies for email marketing and product launches. Considering this, the group is probably better suited to more experienced marketers.3. CXL - Conversion Optimization, Analytics & GrowthFounder: Peep Laja Group type: PrivateTopics covered: Marketing, CRO, growth hackingIdeal for: Mid-level to experienced marketersMember count: 15.1KSign-up link: FacebookPeep Laja is a big believer in evidence-based marketing, and he built growth platform ConversionXL (CXL) on this very premise. His Facebook community is just the same: Members are candid in sharing about their failed experiments and frequently run polls or seek advice on analytics, growth, tag managers, and more.The bulk of discussions revolve around Google Analytics, CRO audits, Google Search Console, as well as recommended marketing reads. You may also stumble upon posts like this one:Given the depth of the conversations, you’re bound to learn something new from the sizable community of CRO-focused marketers. Peep also enforces a no-spam, no-link-dumping rule—something I reckon all of us will appreciate.4. SaaS Products & MarketingFounder: Tomer Aharon Group type: PrivateTopics covered: Marketing, entrepreneurship, social media Ideal for: Beginners to experienced marketersMember count: 15.8KSign-up link: FacebookRun by Tomer Aharon—co-founder of software development platform Premio and SaaS product Poptin—this group helps SaaS founders and digital marketers of all levels share knowledge, ideas, and growth hacks.I’ve found the community to be a helpful one. There are discussions on lead generation methods for SaaS startups, sharings on B2B marketing outreach tactics, as well as brainstorming threads on marketing outreach.While promotional posts are allowed, these must be strictly SaaS-related. You’ll also find freelance and full-time job postings for marketing roles on occasion.5. Facebook Ad HacksFounder: Catherine HowellGroup type: PrivateTopics covered: Marketing, Facebook adsIdeal for: Mid-level and experienced marketers, agency owners Member count: 148.8KSign-up link: FacebookThis group is ideal for anyone who’s interested in discussing marketing best practices, social media ad campaigns, and management of client relationships (for agencies). While there are many insightful discussions, these can get fairly technical. Thus, having prior marketing knowledge is probably useful.Founder Catherine Howell, who also helms social media agency Eight Loop Social and has been featured in the likes of Entrepreneur and Inc., is just as active in the community as the members.For instance, she regularly poses questions or relatable memes.If there’s one drawback of Facebook Ad Hacks, it’s the high volume of activity in the group. There are about 28 posts daily, which means questions tend to get washed down or go unanswered. I ultimately opted to turn off notifications for the group and visit it on occasion when I’m in need of advice or inspiration.6. Sisters in SEOFounders: Kari DePhillips, Samantha Pennington Group type: PrivateTopics: Marketing, entrepreneurship, SEO Ideal for: Beginners to experienced marketers, SEOsMember count: 10KSign-up link: Facebook Sisters in SEO began in 2018 to support women, minorities, and gender-diverse folks in the tech space.Its founding story is interesting too: After attending an SEO course by The Content Factory, Samantha Pennington reached out to agency owner Kari DePhillips. The pair soon found common ground in wanting a safe place to share SEO knowledge—and so set up the Facebook group.Today, the community remains an inclusive and safe space for members to discuss general and technical SEO, career advice or job openings, and recommended SEO tools.The camaraderie is apparent and reminiscent of Women in Tech SEO’s. I also like that there’s plenty of support and encouragement from members, as well as occasional SEO jokes.7. Google SEM MastermindFounder: Schieler Mew Group type: PrivateTopics: SEM, local SEO, Google Ads Ideal for: Mid-level to experienced marketers, SEOs, Google Ads specialistsMember count: 56KSign-up link: FacebookThis marketing group is a little more niche, with a myriad of questions on redirects, Google Search Console, improving low click-through rates, and more. And there’s plenty to learn, with active engagement of up to 20 quality posts a day.Founder Schieler Mew is a passionate SEO himself and has the experience to speak for it. After working as an affiliate marketer for tech majors Uber and Lyft, he turned his focus to local SEO to help small businesses thrive.Today, he’s the co-founder of ServiceLifter.com, a marketing agency that helps home-service companies grow their online presence.Schieler’s focus on sharing knowledge with Google SEM Mastermind members is clear. Apart from anecdotes and interesting findings, he runs educational polls to help marketers find further growth. There are also moderators who share interesting takeaways with the growing community.8. Dumb SEO QuestionsFounder: Jim Munro Group type: OpenTopics: SEOIdeal for: Beginners to experienced marketers, SEOsMember count: 15.2KSign-up link: Facebook With a name like Dumb SEO Questions, joining this group quashes any potential embarrassment about asking, well, dumb SEO questions. After all, this encourages more open discussions among members.Expect healthy activity of up to seven posts daily, with discussions centering on technical SEO, Google Analytics, and Google Search Console.Given how open the community is to marketers of all levels, it’s an excellent space to pick up tips from experts while asking “green” questions without fear of being judged. It’s also nice that the page has a strict policy against self-promotions, ensuring that learnings and discussions are streamlined for members.Founder Jim Munro maintains an active presence in the group too.Every month, he compiles questions from the group and takes them to SEO experts like David Rosam and Tim Capper via a livestream session on his YouTube channel. The channel is currently on its 426th episode—that’s some real dedication.9. Local SEO Strategies & Google My Business Help with Tim KahlertFounder: Tim KahlertGroup type: PrivateTopics covered: SEO, entrepreneurshipIdeal for: Entrepreneurs, founders, business ownersMember count: 36.2KSign-up link: FacebookReady to learn some solid, local SEO strategies? This group may be a good starting point. As an SEO himself, founder Tim Kahlert faced multiple roadblocks when he got banned from several marketing groups for being overly helpful in responding to members’ questions.In response, he built the Local SEO Strategies community to further his knowledge-sharing, as well as help businesses drive leads and conversions through local marketing strategies.The community seems better suited to business owners and entrepreneurs who need basic SEO advice, although there are quite a few marketers who weigh in on discussions too. From what I’ve gathered, many questions are to do with Google My Business profiles, local area pages, ranking better in Google Maps, and SEO.To ensure the shared content is kept fresh and relevant, the community disallows the cross-sharing of Facebook posts and YouTube videos. That’s something I quite like, having scrolled past my share of unrelated or tired content in other marketing groups.10. Superstar SEOFounder: Chris M. Walker Group type: PrivateTopics covered: SEO, general marketingIdeal for: Beginners to experienced marketers, SEOsMember count: 74.8KSign-up link: FacebookWant to get better at SEO? This Facebook group is built on the power of collective knowledge—with the aim of improving lives by building and growing better products and businesses.That’s according to founder Chris Walker, whose shift to SEO was out of serendipity. After stints in IT and politics, he fell into affiliate marketing before setting up freelance marketplace Legiit and Superstar SEO.The latter community comprises a healthy mix of SEOs, marketers, and agency owners. And the content is insightful, no matter your level of experience: discussions span technical SEO, portfolio-building tips, toolset recommendations, and then some.Overall, I like that fellow members are respectful and generous in offering their thoughts. There’s no such thing as a bad question; rather, it’s all about gaining knowledge as a community.Final thoughtsIt’s far more beneficial to join a handful of quality Facebook groups than every group you stumble upon. Observe, engage, and don’t be afraid to be picky. Also, respect the community guidelines and always keep an open mind!If you want to further expand your network, we’ve got more this way:7 Best Online Marketing Communities4 Best Facebook Groups for SEOs (Most Voted For) 11 Slack Communities for SEOs and MarketersDid I miss anything out?
