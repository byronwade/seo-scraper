You can now view historical keyword rankings dating back to May 2015.Comparison modeThis is what makes the new report so powerful.Specify a time period for comparison and instantly see all traffic, position, and ranking URL changes dating back to 2015.Let‚Äôs take a quick look at how this report can be used: the folks at Canva have a Templates section on their website which lost a lot of search traffic recently.With the new Organic keywords report, we can quickly identify which specific keywords have lost or dropped in ranking positions, causing a loss in traffic.So yeah, Comparison mode is incredibly useful. Now, you can easily investigate the cause of any traffic drops that happened back in time.Positions filterYou can also filter by position changes using the position filter.Maybe you only want to see new or lost keywords, or you only want to see keywords that improved or declined in position. Your pick!Other featuresWe also made a bunch of smaller enhancements that make life a lot easier.Separate filters and improved search modes for keyword and URL filtersPreviously, it wasn‚Äôt possible to search for different terms in each of these filters at the same time. Now you can go wild üòâPlus, both filters got a huge upgrade with more advanced search options. They‚Äôre now much, much more convenient to work with.Unranked features option in SERP featuresYou now have an option to see ‚Äúunranked‚Äù features.Color coding for KDWe‚Äôve also added colors to KD ratings ‚Äì it‚Äôs standardized with what we‚Äôre using in Keywords Explorer.Range presets for positions filterAnother enhancement for the Positions filter: there‚Äôs no need to type in numbers for popular requests like top 3 or top 10 keywords anymore. Just click on our preset ranges to filter instantly.--That‚Äôs all for today, but keep in mind that this isn‚Äôt the final form of the new Organic keywords report. Right now, it doesn‚Äôt contain the positions history chart that the old report had and shows only the best position per keyword.But we‚Äôll be rolling out new features gradually and beefing up the report, so look out for our post updates when we do.Go give it a try!
