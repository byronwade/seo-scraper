Say hello to reports. How reports work Our report builder allows you to create your own reports using widgets from Ahrefs’ Site Explorer and Rank Tracker data.To add your first report, click on Create report. Or the Create dropdown on the left menu.Once created, you’ll have a blank canvas where you can add widgets from: existing projects, portfolios, and custom targets.To add a widget, click on the Add widget button. Depending on the type of widget, you can customize its:Heading nameTarget URL + pathVolumeLocationTime periodData granularityComparison dateNOTE For projects and portfolios, widgets that feature competitor comparisons will fetch data from the main competitors added during the project setup.Competitors can be further edited as well. If there are none added, you will need to specify them in the widget settings.Congrats, you’ve now added your first widget! Once you add more, you can rearrange them with a simple click and drag. Use cases With so many widgets to choose from, here’s a bunch of reports you can start with:1. Monthly SEO reportThis is a classic report where you summarize important metrics that reflect a client website’s organic search performance, backlink profile strength, and website health score.Its main purpose? To share useful insights on how your SEO efforts add up for a given time period.Target: Client websiteTool: Site ExplorerWidgets to include:Summary: Last 30 daysOrganic search - Organic traffic: Last 30 daysOrganic traffic by location: Last 30 daysTop organic keywords: Winners/Losers [country]Top organic keywords: New/Lost [country]Backlink profile: All widgets2. Monthly competitor analysis reportWouldn’t it be great if you could gather intel on your competitors on auto-pilot without pulling outdated data from different sources? Let’s be honest, nobody uses that spreadsheet anyway.Instead, group a bunch of competitors into a portfolio and create a report with the following settings:Target: Portfolio (top 10 competitors)Tool: Site ExplorerWidgets to include:Top organic keywords: Winners/Losers [country]Top organic keywords: New/Lost [country]Referring domains: By follow typeThis allows you to proactively monitor your industry as a whole and make strategic moves that increase your brand’s visibility over your competitors’.For example, we’ve just noticed that one of our competitors has climbed up the rankings from position #5 to #1 for the keyword “serp features monitor”. We’re not even ranking in the Top 10 for it, so we might consider covering the topic.3. Dashboard for brand monitoringLet’s face it, C-level executives prefer dashboard reports for a big-picture view of the search landscape. Middle managers can also use these type of “search dashboards” to get more SEO resource buy-in for large marketing and SEO campaigns.For this type of report, focus on widgets that paint the big picture:Target: Client websiteTool: Site ExplorerWidgets to include:Organic traffic competitors: Last 6 monthsReferring domains competitors: Last 6 monthsJudging by the last screenshot, it seems like one of our competitors had a sudden traffic spike. All that’s left is to investigate what was the cause and whether or not we can still capitalize on it.4. Monthly regional rankings reportIf you operate globally and manage local content, a monthly regional rankings report could serve as your success barometer.Only this time, we’ll focus on widgets from the Rank Tracker tool, which monitors rankings across 190+ locations on both desktop and mobile.Target: Regional websitesTool: Rank TrackerWidgets to include:Top keywords: By trafficDevice: DesktopIn the example above, we’ve monitored all desktop rankings for our five international blogs. But you can get more creative and compare the desktop vs. mobile rankings for a complete picture.NOTE You can add widgets from different projects, portfolios, and targets in the same report. Limitations and upcoming features While in beta, Reports are free for all paid plans – including legacy ones.Currently, you can only add widgets from Site Explorer and Rank Tracker. Each workspace allows up to 50 reports and 200 widgets, with a maximum of 50 widgets/report.In the future, they will support:Headings and paragraphs for better formattingSharing and scheduling reports for clients, via email (you can only share them with your team now)Site Audit widgets for website health monitoringHave any use cases in mind or suggestions for improvements?
