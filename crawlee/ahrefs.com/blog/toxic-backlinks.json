Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents Toxic backlinks are links that some SEO tools say could hurt your website’s Google rankings. The implication is that you should disavow them to keep your site safe.But there’s some disagreement and confusion among SEOs as to whether “toxic” links are actually a thing and what, if anything, you should do about them. If you believe Google’s John Mueller, they’re not: Sidenote. John has since deleted this tweet. Tin-foil hats at the ready!Yet, according to my poll, the majority (just!) of SEOs think they are: do you think “toxic backlinks” are a thing? btw i’m sticking with yes/no here to gauge the general consensus, but if you’re feeling “it depends” then reply with why 🙂— Joshua Hardwick (@JoshuaCHardwick) February 6, 2024 So… what’s the deal here? Are toxic backlinks actually a thing? Are they hurting your site? And if so, what should you be doing about them? Before we can answer those questions, we need to understand the terminology… ContentsSpammy, manipulative, and toxic links… they’re not the same thing!Every website has some spammy backlinks that just don’t make sense. But that doesn’t necessarily make them manipulative or “toxic.”For example, here are a couple of obviously spammy links to our site: We didn’t build or buy either of these, so they’re not “manipulative” by definition. They’re just low-quality links we’ve attracted over time because the internet is rife with spammers. If you study Google’s link spam documentation carefully, you’ll see that, in theory, these aren’t the kind of spammy links they have a problem with. They warn only against the ill effects of spam links intended to manipulate rankings. Google uses links as an important factor in determining the relevancy of web pages. Any links that are intended to manipulate rankings in Google Search results may be considered link spam. This includes any behavior that manipulates links to your site or outgoing links from your site. Here are the examples Google gives of these manipulative links: As for “toxic backlinks,” this is just a term made up by certain SEO tools to describe backlinks they think could hurt your rankings based on several so-called “markers.” https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1533697837703348224Key takeawaySpammy links are low-quality links that every site attracts through no fault of their own. Manipulative links are links built or bought solely to improve Google rankings. Toxic links are links that certain SEO tools say could hurt your website’s rankings. Will spammy links hurt your rankings?If you asked this question before September 2016, the answer would have likely been “yes.” Now it’s “probably not.” So what changed? Penguin 4.0.With this algorithm update, Google switched from demoting pages to a system that tries to ignore bad links. Penguin is now more granular. Penguin now devalues spam by adjusting ranking based on spam signals, rather than affecting ranking of the whole site. Since then, Google’s stance has been that you can ignore spammy backlinks. If you’re seeing individual links that pop up and you say, “oh this looks like a spammer dropped the link” or whatever, I would completely ignore those. […] because these spammy links happen to every website and Google’s system has seen them so many times over the years that we’re very good at just ignoring them. John Mueller, Search Advocate GoogleBut is this true? Is Google really as good at ignoring low-level spam as we’re made to believe? Judging by my colleague Chris’s recent poll on LinkedIn, a good chunk of SEOs (38%) don’t think so, as they’re still disavowing them. Does that mean they’re right to do so? Not necessarily. It just means they don’t fully trust Google that they won’t do any harm. They’re being careful. Personally, the person I trust most to answer this question in 2024 is Dr. Marie Haynes. I don’t think anyone’s done more research into this than her. She’s spent well over a decade working to understand Google’s search algorithms and auditing link profiles on behalf of business owners. Now, the interesting part of that statement (and why I actually trust her!) is the obvious conflict of interest. Until fairly recently, she made her living selling link audit and disavow file creation services—and for a pretty hefty sum at that! Pricing from Marie’s link audit services page in March 2023Clearly, it would be good news for Marie if Google were still terrible at ignoring spammy backlinks because she could sell more link audits! Yet, these days, she no longer appears to offer such services. In fact, she’s actually been warning folks against the need to disavow low-quality, spammy backlinks for a few years. Here’s a quote from a 2022 blog post of hers:While there is no harm in disavowing low quality spammy links, it likely does not help improve rankings. We believe that Google’s algorithms are already ignoring these links. […]. When we do see improvements these days after disavowing, it is always in sites where we have disavowed links that were purposely made for SEO and very little else. Marie Haynes, CEO Marie Haynes ConsultingIt’s clear that Marie is being cautious with her words here. But overall, her opinion after digging into this for many years seems to be that, yes, Google is now pretty good at ignoring most low-quality spammy links. Does that mean they’re perfect? No. But it does mean that worrying about obvious low-quality link spam is probably a waste of time for most people. Will manipulative links hurt your rankings? If you’re buying or building the types of links that Google class as “link spam” then, yes, they can absolutely hurt your rankings.But before you panic about that link exchange you did with your best friend’s wife’s brother, Google is likely looking for patterns of manipulation here. In other words, manipulative link profiles rather than manipulative individual links: Danny Richman, founder of Richman SEO Training, agrees: I don’t believe in toxic links. I do believe in toxic link profiles.— Danny Richman (@DannyRichman) February 6, 2024 Here’s a bit more context from Danny: Sorry 🙂 I don’t believe any single link - in isolation - is harmful. However, a ton of crappy links pointing to a site is a whole different story. It’s all about the bigger picture.— Danny Richman (@DannyRichman) February 6, 2024 As for Marie Haynes, she echoes a similar sentiment in this post. She states that manual actions aside, she would only recommend a client disavow links if they have “a very large number of links that [they] feel the webspam team would consider to be ‘manipulative.’ ”In these cases, Google often slaps the worst offenders with an unnatural links manual action. If you get one of those, that’s Google telling you, “Hey… you’re being demoted in search because we think you’ve been trying to game the system with manipulative links.” But this doesn’t have to happen for manipulative links to be a problem. It’s possible for Google to algorithmically demote a site if they detect a large volume of spammy and manipulative links, at least according to John Mueller.If we see a very strong pattern [of spammy links] there, then it can happen that our algorithms say well, we really have kind of lost trust with this website and at the moment based on the bigger picture on the web, we kind of need to be more on almost a conservative side when it comes to to understanding this website’s content and ranking it in the search results. And then you can see kind of a drop in the visibility there. John Mueller, Search Advocate GoogleEither way, the point remains: it’s patterns of manipulation that are likely to hurt rankings. There’s very little chance that you need to worry about the odd potentially dodgy link here and there. How to find truly toxic links that may be hurting your rankings While it might be tempting to use an SEO tool that finds “toxic backlinks” for you, I’d seriously urge you to reconsider. Trusting these can do more harm than good. Way more. Just look at this unfortunate Redditor’s reply to John Mueller: A 60% drop in traffic! That’s no joke! Even if this is an extreme case, worrying about these links likely only wastes time because, according to Marie Haynes, they’re rarely truly toxic: I find that the truly toxic links…the ones that could have the potential to harm your site algorithmically (although you’d have to really overdo it, as I’ll describe below), are rarely returned by an SEO tool. Marie Haynes, CEO Marie Haynes ConsultingSam McRoberts, CEO of VUVU Marketing, seems to agree: Sure, clearly if you secure a bunch of PBN links and Google spots it and gives you a manual penalty, they were “toxic links”—but the links marked as toxic by most SEO tools are very often neutral at worst, not toxic.— Sam McRoberts (@Sams_Antics) February 6, 2024 So… how do you find truly toxic backlinks that are likely to be hurting your site? The truth? You might not even need to look for them. If you haven’t built or bought links that Google considers link spam at any reasonable scale, chances are you’re good. If you’re not confident about that, do a manual backlink audit with a tool like Ahrefs’ Site Explorer.The Anchors report is a good starting point if you’ve never done this. It shows you the words and phrases people use when linking to you. If they look unnatural or over-optimized (lots of exact matches of keywords you’re trying to rank for), that could be a sign you have paid or other links intended to manipulate rankings. If things look fishy there, use the Backlinks report to dig deeper and check the context of those links. It’s usually quite easy to spot paid and unnatural ones. Just remember that you’re looking for patterns of unnatural links, not just one or two. WARNINGIf you’re not 100% sure what you’re looking for when doing a backlink audit, hire someone who knows what they’re doing. You need to be confident that the links are truly “toxic.”Should you disavow “toxic” links?If you have a manual action for unnatural links or a bunch of what you believe to be truly toxic backlinks, yes. Google’s advice is to disavow them (assuming you can’t get the links removed). You should disavow backlinks only if: You have a considerable number of spammy, artificial, or low-quality links pointing to your site, ANDThe links have caused a manual action, or likely will cause a manual action, on your site. Marie Haynes advises the same: There are two situations where we will recommend to our clients a thorough link audit followed by filing a disavow: The site has a manual action for unnatural links in GSC. The site has a very large number of links that we feel the webspam team would consider to be “manipulative”.Marie Haynes, CEO Marie Haynes ConsultingIf you just have a bunch of spammy backlinks that most sites naturally attract or the odd paid backlink, probably not. Google probably ignores most, if not all, of these links, so disavowing them is likely a waste of time. While there is no harm in disavowing these links other than the time spent analyzing them, there is likely no benefit either. Marie Haynes, CEO Marie Haynes ConsultingBut what about negative SEO?Being the victim of a negative SEO attack is indeed the possible exception here. This is when a competitor sends a load of spammy or toxic backlinks your way to try to get your site penalized. Google remains adamant that it basically never works, but it really comes down to what you believe. [I’ve] looked at hundreds of supposed cases of negative SEO, but none have actually been the real reason a website was hurt. […] While it’s easier to blame negative SEO, typically the culprit of a traffic drop is something else you don’t know about–perhaps an algorithm update or an issue with their website. Gary Illyes, Webmaster Trends Analyst GoogleIf you see a traffic drop after an influx of backlinks in Site Explorer, I’d say that it’s at least worth a bit more investigation. This site experienced a traffic drop coinciding with an influx of referring domains. Maybe there’s benefit to disavowing here… and maybe it’s something else!As Gary said above, something else could be to blame—but you never know. There’s always a chance that Google’s algorithms rule it was you who built or bought those backlinks to try to manipulate rankings and penalize you for it. If you just found a bunch of so-called “toxic backlinks” in an SEO tool, probably not. Again, most of these are probably just link spam Google already ignores. Here’s yet another quote from Marie Haynes backing this up: While there is probably no harm in disavowing [links reported as toxic in SEO tools], you are not likely to see any improvement as a result. Disavowing is meant for sites trying to remove a manual action and for those who have been actively building links for the purpose of improving rankings. Marie Haynes, CEO Marie Haynes ConsultingThere’s also the risk that you could end up disavowing links that are actually helping you… Patrick showed further evidence that this can absolutely happen when he experimented with disavowing links to the Ahrefs blog. Traffic dipped, then went back up after he removed the disavow. Final thoughts“Toxic backlinks” is a term made up by certain SEO tools to scare you. That’s not to say bad links can’t hurt your site. They absolutely can. But fortunately for most site owners, it’s rarely a problem worth worrying all that much about. Got questions? Disagree? Ping me on Twitter X.
