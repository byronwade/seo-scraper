Do keyword researchKeyword research is where you find the words and phrases your target audience is typing into Google. The easiest way to start is to use a keyword research tool like Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer.Just enter a relevant topic, go to the Matching terms report, switch the toggle to Questions, and you’ll get tens of thousands of potential keyword ideas:If the list is too large, you can narrow it down using a Keyword Difficulty (KD) filter and a Traffic Potential (TP) filter to focus on high-traffic, low-competition keywords. Just set the max KD filter to a low number like 20 and the TP filter to a minimum of something like 500:If you want to refine the list even further to keywords more likely to be within your wheelhouse, set the “Lowest DR” filter to your website’s Domain Rating (DR) score (find this by plugging your domain into Site Explorer). You will then see only keywords that websites of similar “authority” rank for.2. Learn from your competitorsIf you have competitors, they’re likely already ranking for many keywords on Google. You can see what they’re ranking for and target the same topics, too.Here’s how:Go to Ahrefs’ Site ExplorerEnter your competitor’s domainGo to Top pagesThis report shows the pages generating the most search traffic for your competitor. For example, Beardbrand’s post on beard styles gets an estimated 69,000 monthly search visits. Out of the 9,542 keywords it ranks for, “beard styles” sends the most traffic.If you’re competing with Beardbrand, this could be a good topic to write about.100 blog post ideas by topicHere are a few blog post ideas with traffic potential that we found using the methods above, broken down by category:BusinessTopicMonthly Traffic PotentialHow to create a business plan75,000How to do a SWOT analysis55,000What are key performance indicators13,000How to do a cost-benefit analysis8,400Types of marketing strategies6,800How to do business development5,700What is competitive advantage and how to find it5,000How to retain customers2,900How to acquire customers900How to manage a business’ cash flow700FinanceTopicMonthly Traffic PotentialXX cheapest car insurance companies530,000XX best high yield savings accounts497,000How to make money online376,000How much house can I afford?264,000XX best travel credit cards149,000XX passive income ideas67,000How to improve credit score43,000How to invest in stocks43,000How to invest in real estate30,000XX ways to save money25,000MarketingTopicMonthly Traffic PotentialWhat is content marketing and how to do it17,000How to do market research13,000How to create a marketing plan7,700What is lead generation and how to do it6,800XX top marketing trends3,800How to calculate and improve conversion rate3,600How to do customer segmentation2,200How to measure marketing ROI1,900XX types of marketing channels1,800What is a marketing funnel and how to build one1,800FashionTopicMonthly Traffic PotentialXX Taylor Swift concert outfit ideas51,000How to dress for your body type4,000Fashion weeks around the world2,800How to find your fashion style2,800XX cute outfit ideas2,600What is haute couture2,400XX airport outfit ideas2,300What is sustainable fashion and why it matters2,200XX fashion influencers to follow1,300What is slow fashion1,200BeautyTopicMonthly Traffic PotentialHow to get rid of acne scars37,000XX acne treatments that work28,000XX best moisturiser for dry skin9,600How to master the XX-step Korean skincare routine8,900How to prevent aging4,700XX natural beauty tips4,000What causes sensitive skin2,900XX best liquid eyeliner1,900XX beauty influencers to follow600XX best beauty supplements200TechnologyTopicMonthly Traffic PotentialHow to use ChatGPT291,000XX best VPNs118,000XX best gaming laptops53,000XX best fitness watches37,000XX best budget gaming PCs20,000How to build a PC13,000How to make QR codes7,100The quietest mechanical keyboard2,600GPU price trends2,100Why does my GPU fan not spin and how to fix it1,400FitnessTopicMonthly Traffic PotentialIntermittent fasting for beginners69,000XX kettlebell exercises for a full workout7,000XX best pull-up substitutes5,700Can you gain muscle in a calorie deficit4,700XX grip strength exercises4,000The best workout for skinny guys2,200How to do a pull up2,200A handstand progression plan1,100Are acai bowls good for weight loss700Jedi training300TravelTopicMonthly Traffic PotentialHow to find cheap hotels195,000XX best travel blogs9,000Best places to visit in Costa Rica6,500XX things to do in Medellin3,300Is Cancun safe2,900XX best travel tips2,900How to travel cheap2,900Where to stay in Boston2,200Is Greece expensive1,1005-day Paris itinerary800HomeTopicMonthly Traffic PotentialWhere to buy inexpensive furniture18,000XX living room color ideas12,000XX accent wall ideas9,300How much does an interior designer cost4,000XX types of couches3,200XX bedroom essentials2,000How to decorate coffee table1,600Rules for rug under bed1,600How to measure for a sectional1,100XX best loveseats600FoodTopicMonthly Traffic PotentialXX easy ramen recipes81,000Fish taco recipe57,000XX best espresso machines38,000XX must-try Peruvian dishes12,000XX pressure cooker recipes11,000How to boil shrimp10,000How to keep apples from turning brown3,500XX Chinese New Year foods for good luck2,300Sous vide ribeye recipe1,500How to peel garlic350Final thoughtsIf you’re serious about blogging, you need to learn how to do keyword research and competitive research.
