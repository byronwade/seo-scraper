Get the week's best marketing content Email Subscription Subscribe Leave this field empty if you're human: Contents I asked my audience on LinkedIn for the most common SEO mistakes they’ve seen and got 100+ suggestions.Here are the top 15 mistakes organized from most to least major:1. Blocking Google from crawlingIf Google can’t crawl your content, it can’t see what’s on the page. And if it can’t see what’s on the page, it’s unlikely it’ll rank for any relevant keywords.How to ensure Google can crawl your siteMake sure you’re not blocking Googlebot.Do this check by going to your robots.txt (yourdomain.com/robots.txt) and looking for these two snippets of code:User-agent: Googlebot Disallow: /User-agent: * Disallow: /Both lines of code tell Googlebot it’s not allowed to crawl any pages on your site. To fix the issue, remove them.Further readingRobots.txt and SEO: Everything You Need to Know2. Blocking Google from indexing your pagesIf you’ve accidentally blocked Google from indexing your site or its pages, it’s impossible to rank. For example, that can happen if you accidentally added a noindex tag on any of your pages.How to ensure Google can index your contentSign up for a free Ahrefs Webmaster Tools account, then run a crawl on your site using Site Audit. If you have pages that are noindexed, that will pop up as an issue:Fix the issue by removing the noindex tag.Further readingHow to Get Google to Index Your Website 3. Not doing keyword researchMany people randomly create content and expect to get search traffic. But if no one’s searching for those topics, then no one’s clicking through to any pages.That’s likely one of the reasons why 96.55% of pages get no traffic from Google, according to our study.If you want search traffic, you need to target topics people are searching for.How to do keyword researchGo to Ahrefs’ Keywords ExplorerEnter one or a few relevant keywords related to your website or nicheGo to the Matching terms reportFor example, if you sell coffee equipment, you’ll see >1 million potential keywords you can target. Look through the list and pick out keywords that are relevant and have traffic potential (look at the TP column.)Further readingKeyword Research: The Beginner’s Guide by Ahrefs4. Not matching search intentGoogle’s goal is to provide users with the most relevant result for every query.So, if you want to rank high on Google, you need to be the most relevant result. This means matching search intent, the why behind a query.For example, we previously created a landing page to target the keyword “backlink checker.” But it didn’t rank well because searchers wanted a free tool. So, we added it.The result: 516% more traffic in less than six months.How to match search intentEnter your keyword into Keywords Explorer, scroll down to SERP Overview, and click on Identify intents. This feature will suggest the most likely search intent for your target keyword.Further readingSearch Intent in SEO: What It Is & How to Optimize for It 5. Not enough backlinksLinks are an important Google ranking factor.So, if your pages are not ranking well, a key reason might be you don’t have enough links.For example, we would like to rank for the keyword “seo.” But if you look at the top-ranking pages for that keyword, they have tons of backlinks.As of right now, our page simply doesn’t have enough:How to build more linksThere are many ways to build links, but one good way to start is to see how your competitors have gotten their links. From there, you can attempt to “replicate” their links.Bear in mind that it’s impossible to replicate all their backlinks, and replicate them like-for-like. But there are a few ways you can attempt to reproduce similar links.For example, if you’re in an industry with many interviews and podcasts, you can find out where they’ve appeared and see if you can pitch to be on the same podcasts.Here’s how to find their podcast appearances:Go to Site ExplorerEnter the Twitter profile URL of your competitor’s CEO, CMO, or whoever the most prolific marketer is within the companyGo to the Backlinks reportFilter for results where the referring page URL contains “podcast,” “episode,” or “interview”You just need to pitch the same interviews and podcasts.Further readingHow to Find Your Competitors’ Backlinks (And Get Them for Yourself) 6. Buying backlinksBuying backlinks is against Google’s Webmaster Guidelines. If they suspect you of doing this, they might slap you with an unnatural links manual action and demote or remove your site from their search results.Exactly a week ago, on Monday Oct 24th, I was hit with a manual action “unnatural links to your site” that impacts “some pages” (not site wide). Luckily my site has held up remarkably well so far. I have someone who deals with this sort of thing working on the review but… pic.twitter.com/UgXkLu2V1r— Mike (Niche Twins) 🏴‍☠️ (@NicheDown) October 31, 2022 Even if you don’t get a manual action, you might get demoted algorithmically.Here’s what Google’s John Mueller says:“If our systems recognize that they can’t isolate and ignore these links across a website, if we see a very strong pattern there, then it can happen that our algorithms say well we really have kind of lost trust with this website and at the moment based on the bigger picture on the web, we kind of need to be more on almost a conservative side when it comes to understanding this website’s content and ranking it in the search results and then you can see kind of a drop in the visibility there.”How to avoid this SEO mistakeDon’t buy links.7. Treating SEO as a one-time thingSEO is not simply a matter of fixing all of these mistakes and calling it a day.Even if you’re ranking in pole position today, there is no guarantee you’ll be number one tomorrow. Ranking high on search engines is a competition. Your competitors will invest plenty of resources to knock you off the perch.How to avoid this SEO mistakeThe recommendations in this post aren’t just for fixing a one-time mistake. They’re strategies you should be consistently doing to rank high on Google:Doing keyword researchCreating content that aligns with search intentTrying to build and earn more backlinksEnsuring your site is technically soundUpdating content when it’s outdated8. Scaling low-quality content with AICase studies like this are seductive:We pulled off an SEO heist that stole 3.6M total traffic from a competitor.We got 489,509 traffic in October alone.Here’s how we did it: pic.twitter.com/sTJ7xbRjrT— Jake Ward (@jakezward) November 24, 2023 It’s tempting to follow their example, upload a list of target keywords into an AI writing tool, and have it generate all the content for you.How to use AI in content creationGoogle is not fundamentally opposed to AI content. It doesn’t care how you create it; it just cares about helpfulness for users.The problem, however, is that AI cannot create valuable content that users want to see. It cannot conduct research, share personal experiences, defend an opinion, or provide nuanced discussions.So, while you may use AI to help with your content creation, don’t generate content and publish it as-is. Make sure you’re adding value where AI cannot.My colleague Ryan Law has identified three areas where humans can generate unique value:Experimentation — Go into the real world, test ideas, and collect new information that has never existed before. For example, conducting industry surveys or running tests.Experience — Prove to the reader you have experienced the thing you’re writing about. For example, only writing about topics you have experience with or interviewing people on topics you don’t.Effort — Expend energy and create content that’s more than just words on a page. For example, webcomics, video series, books, and more.Further readingAI Content Is Short-Term Arbitrage, Not Long-Term Strategy 9. Missing internal link opportunitiesInternal links are important:Google uses them to discover new content.They aid the flow of PageRank around your site. Generally speaking, the more internal links a page has, the higher its PageRank.Google looks at the anchor texts of internal links to better understand the context.Yet, internal links are usually not prioritized. Big mistake.How to find internal link opportunitiesRun a crawl using Ahrefs’ Site Audit (via AWT). Once the crawl is complete, go to the Internal link opportunities report.This report will show you relevant internal link opportunities. Go through the list and add internal links where relevant.Further readingInternal Links for SEO: An Actionable Guide 10. Slow pagesCore Web Vitals are metrics that are part of Google’s Page Experience signals used to measure user experience. They’re also a Google ranking factor.Not only will a slow site affect your Google rankings, but it will also impact your sales. According to Unbounce, nearly 70% of consumers admit that page speed impacts their willingness to buy from an online retailer.How to fix slow pagesRun a website crawl using Site Audit and you’ll be able to see your Core Web Vitals performance:Some ways to improve your Core Web Vitals:Use caching — If you’re using WordPress, you can install a plugin like W3 Total Cache or WPRocketMake files smaller, e.g. images — Plugins like Shortpixel help to compress and optimize your imagesServe files closer to users — For example, you can use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)Optimize fonts — WPRocket helps with thisReduce the amount of JavaScript — Similarly, WPRocket helps with this. You can also use AutoptimizeFurther readingWhat Are Core Web Vitals (CWVs) & How To Improve Them 11. Schema markup spamSchema markup is code that helps search engines understand the information on a page. Google can use it to show rich results (also known as rich snippets), which can earn a page more clicks.Unfortunately, some SEOs have taken it to mean that they can add all sorts of irrelevant schema to their pages, in hopes of ranking higher.It can’t be further from the truth: Not only can schema markup spam lead to a Google penalty, it rarely works because Google can spot it.How to avoid this SEO mistakeHere are instructions directly from Google’s structured data guidelines:Follow the spam policies for Google web search.Provide up-to-date information.Provide original content that you or your users have generated.Don’t mark up content that is not visible to readers of the page.Don’t mark up irrelevant or misleading content, such as fake reviews or content unrelated to a page’s focus.Don’t use structured data to deceive or mislead users. Don’t impersonate any person or organization, or misrepresent your ownership, affiliation, or primary purpose.Content in structured data must also follow the additional content guidelines or policies, as documented in the specific feature guide.Further readingSchema Markup: What It Is & How to Implement It12. Keyword stuffingKeyword stuffing is the process of cramming a page full of keywords, in an attempt to rank higher for those keywords.Here’s an example of keyword stuffing:Finding the top mirrorless camera can be a daunting task. Yet, with our comprehensive best mirrorless camera guide, we simplify the process by ranking the best mirrorless camera models and the most reliable mirrorless camera brands.Not only does keyword stuffing make your content look unnatural, it is also against Google’s spam policies.How to avoid keyword stuffingInstead of trying to shoehorn related keywords into your content, focus on creating content that’s comprehensive instead. In fact, Google encourages this in their Helpful Content guidelines:To create comprehensive content, you need to cover important subtopics searchers expect to see. Here’s how to find these subtopics:Go to Keywords ExplorerEnter your target keywordScroll down to SERP OverviewCheck three relevant top-ranking pagesClick Open in and choose Content gapThis will open the Content gap report, which shows you the common keywords these three pages are ranking for. Many of them will be important subtopics you should cover.For example, if we were targeting the keyword “inbound marketing”, these would make great H2s:What is inbound marketingInbound marketing strategyInbound marketing examplesInbound marketing tools13. Obsessing over word countThere is a myth in SEO that longer content performs better. This ends up in an arms race: SEOs fighting to make their blog posts as long as possible.But nobody is clamoring to read longer posts. When Medium studied the correlation between post length and average reading time, they noticed that engagement started to drop for posts with a reading time longer than seven minutes.Our own study has also found that there was only a moderate correlation between content length and organic traffic up to 2,000 words. For posts longer than 2,000 words, there is a moderate negative correlation between word count and organic traffic.How to avoid this SEO mistakeIf your article is long because the topic you’re tackling is deep, so be it. If your article is short because the topic is simple, then let it be. Don’t make it longer than necessary. In short: Focus on being comprehensive, not being lengthy. Nobody wants to read Dostoyevsky just to cook a simple fried rice.14. Under-optimized meta titles and descriptionsTitle tags and meta descriptions are the first things a searcher sees when they enter a query. It can be the difference behind whether a searcher clicks through.However, many websites neglect these two tags. When we looked at >1 million domains to find the most common technical SEO issues, meta tag issues like:Meta description tag missing or emptyPage and SERP titles do not matchTitle too longMeta description too shortMeta description too longWere in the top 15 most common.How to fix under-optimized meta titles and descriptionsRun a crawl with Site Audit (free with AWT). You’ll see all the meta tag issues, along with the affected URLs.Fix them.If you’re stuck, you can ask ChatGPT to brainstorm title tag ideas for you and get inspiration.Further readingWhat Are Title Tags? How To Write Them for SEOHow to Write the Perfect Meta Description15. Missing alt textAlt text describes an image on a web page.Not only can it help improve topical relevance on a page, it can also help you rank in Google images. And while you may not think it, Google Images is the second largest search engine in the world.However, I want to point out that this is likely a minor issue. If you’re making any of the mistakes in this post, focus on fixing them first. As the saying goes, “don’t major in minor things.”How to fix missing alt textRun a crawl with Site Audit. This will tell you if you have any images with missing alt text.Click the number to see the affected URLs. All that’s left is to fill in the missing ones.
