Retail Is a WinnerThe top four trending searches relate to retail: walmart home depot amazon prime best buyThere’s no doubt that ecommerce is going strong, and will continue to thrive in the coming year. But it’s the big brands that truly dominate the online search space. If you have a small ecommerce store or bricks-and-mortar location, you can still win. By targeting niche and local keywords and using Google Business Profile, if it applies.2. “Near Me” Boosts RelevancyCovid vaccine near me: Okay, this one was a given—and we hope it won’t be so popular next year. But it goes to show that people are still keen to use the “near me” search term to make sure that the results are super relevant to them. 3. Sports Are BigTo pick a few, we see in the top results: nfl scores framed jerseys atlanta falcons sports memorabilia storeCan you leverage sports news in your own content? Sponsoring a local team or sharing your allegiance might bring some additional views. Tip: Want to know the top trending topics today?

Humane SocietyHumane Society rules the roost, at the very top of the most searched for topics. It’s an international organization with the mission to promote animal welfare and protect endangered animals. Results like this are indicative of a strong brand awareness campaign. 2. Oscar IsaacFamous actor Oscar Isaac comes in at number two. Our analysts suggest that this is probably better than winning an Academy Award. Ultimately, this is most likely driven by PR. It goes to show that a multi-channel approach to marketing has a big impact. 3. Netflix StockNetflix stock fell dramatically during 2022, from a peak of $620.61 to a low of $162.71. It’s no surprise that so many people wanted to track what was going on.4. Abraham LincolnThe 16th President of the United States is perhaps surfacing because of recent political debates and conflict. 5. Celebrity FeverOscar is in good company. Khloé Kardashian, Paris Hilton, Julia Garner, and Tom Hiddleston are just some of the other stars who appear in these results. Celebrity culture is still going strong. If you can find a way of introducing celebrity appeal in your own content, you may see an uptick in traffic. Tip: Find search volumes for keywords with Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool.

This suggests that the biggest cohort of searches were looking for information on getting started with marketing. Let’s explore the top five trending topics in more detail:1. Google Marketing (and Google Marketing Platform)The first term has a very specific informational and navigational intent. Users are looking for the Google Marketing Platform, which is an online advertising and analytics platform.2. Affiliate MarketingAffiliate marketing is the practice of advertising products in return for commission on conversions. That could be visits, signup or sales. It’s a flexible job that can be done from home, which might explain the term’s current popularity.3. What Is Marketing ManagementIt’s hard to say whether searchers are looking to go into marketing management themselves or are looking to employ marketing managers. In either case, it shows the position is on people’s minds.4. Digital Marketing CourseOnce again, this is a term loosely related to employment. Professional development courses lead to better jobs and higher salaries. Perhaps this is on the public mind as we face rising costs and a shaky economy. 5. Branding in MarketingOur 5th term shows people want to know more about branding. Whether that means we’re going to see a rise in new businesses, or whether people are simply interested in becoming branding experts, it’s hard to say. What we can say is that it points to a positive interest in marketing—and therefore in growth.
