  "content": "Here are the three best ways to learn SEO:1. Study SEO BasicsMake sure you know the SEO basics before you dive into tools and resources.Learn What SEO IsSearch engine optimization (SEO) describes all processes and techniques designed to help you rank higher in search engines such as Google. The higher you rank, the more likely you are to drive people to your pages. So, the primary goal of SEO is to get more organic traffic (unpaid traffic) from search engines.TipLearn the basics in our SEO Principles video course to earn a free certificate.Discover How Search Engines WorkTo understand how to do SEO, you need a basic understanding of how search engines work. First, search engines have to discover your page. They use programs (called website crawlers or bots) that follow links from known pages to discover new pages. This is called crawling.After the search engine discovers a new page, it analyzes its content and (hopefully) stores it in a huge database of pages called an index (e.g., the Google index). This step is called indexing.Finally, the search engine uses various algorithms to pick the best and most relevant pages from its index to serve them as ordered search results for users' search queries. This is called ranking. SEO is all about making sure search engines can crawl and index your pages. And showing search engines that your content is the best (in terms of quality, relevance, and user experience).NoteThere are numerous issues that can cause problems at each stage—crawling, indexing, and ranking. So, understanding these concepts and how to optimize for them (which we’ll cover later) is key.Understand SEO Ranking FactorsSEO ranking factors are things that affect your website’s and individual pages’ performance in search engine results.According to our ranking factors study, the most important Google ranking factor is text relevance. Meaning how relevant your page’s content is to the user’s query.Google also considers things like: How fast your page loads The number of other sites link to your website Whether your page uses the secure HTTPS protocolKnow the Types of SEOThe main types of SEO are: On-page SEO: Optimizing a specific page to rank better. Tactics include content optimization, title tag optimization, and internal linking. Off-page SEO: Doing SEO activities that occur outside of your website. Tactics include link building, content syndication, and social media management. Technical SEO: Improving technical aspects of your site for both search engines and users. Tactics include improving page speed and site architecture.There are also SEO tactics for specific content formats, including: Image SEO: Optimizing images to rank better in regular and image results Video SEO: Optimizing videos to rank better in regular results, image results, video results, and on platforms like YouTubeAnd there are even SEO disciplines for specific types of businesses or websites, such as: Local SEO: Tactics that help local businesses rank higher in local results International SEO: Tactics for websites that serve multiple languages and locations Ecommerce SEO: Tactics for online stores SaaS SEO: Tactics for software as a service (SaaS) businesses Small business SEO: Tactics for small businesses B2B SEO: Tactics for business-to-business (B2B) brandsBuild Essential SEO SkillsSEO covers multiple disciplines and requires several hard skills. Here are the most important skills for SEO:Keyword ResearchKeyword research is the process of discovering search terms (i.e., keywords) that relevant audiences type in search engines. So you can target the ones that are likely to be most beneficial for your business.A good keyword research tool will help you analyze things like: Search volume: The average number of monthly searches for a keyword Keyword difficulty: A measure of how hard it’ll be to rank highly in the search results Search intent: The reason behind a user’s search (also known as keyword intent)TipCreate your free Semrush account to try our keyword research tools.SERP AnalysisAssessing the search engine results page (SERP) and results for a given keyword is called SERP analysis.It allows you to identify SEO ranking opportunities. And work out what you need to do to secure them.For example, the SERP for “chocolate cake” is dominated by recipes on popular sites that search engines see as reputable. This means that other types of content and lesser-known sites might struggle to rank here.You’ll also notice various SERP features (non-standard search results). Such as rich snippets with star ratings.If you were writing a chocolate cake recipe, you could optimize for these elements. With the goal of getting more visibility and clicks.TipAnalyze the SERP in your chosen country, region, or city with the Keyword Overview tool. Content CreationContent creation is an important part of SEO because it gives search engines something to evaluate and rank.For the best results, you’ll need to: Come up with relevant content ideas or blog ideas Take advantage of content creation tools Create quality content that’s tailored to your target audience Distribute your content across various channelsGenerally, Google wants to rank unique content that demonstrates Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). Because it wants to provide helpful and reliable results to users.This means your content should be accurate, comprehensive, and relevant to your brand.On-Page OptimizationOn-page optimization is the process of improving the technical and content aspects of your webpages. To make them more user-friendly and relevant to your target keywords. And it helps you rank higher in search engines and attract more organic traffic to your site.Some of the key elements of on-page optimization are: Title tags: The clickable headlines that can appear in search results. They should include your main keyword and a compelling value proposition that entices users to click on your page. Meta descriptions: The snippets of text that may appear below headlines in search results. They should provide a concise summary of your page and include a call to action that encourages users to click. Headers: The subheadings that structure your content and make it easier to read and scan. They should use relevant keywords and follow a logical hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.). Content: The main body of your page that provides useful and engaging information to your audience. It should cover your topic in depth, answer the searchers’ questions, and use natural language and variations of your keywords. Images: The visual elements that enhance your page content and appeal to your audience. They should have descriptive alt text that describes what the image shows and include your keywords when relevant. Internal links: The links that connect your pages to each other and help users navigate your site. They should use descriptive anchor text that indicates what the linked page is about.To do on-page optimization, use a tool that can analyze your pages at scale. For example, On Page SEO Checker pinpoints weaknesses and provides suggestions on how to improve pages across your site. Technical SEOTechnical SEO involves improving various technical aspects of your website. The goal is to make sure search engines can crawl and index your website properly. This includes things like: Having an XML sitemap (a file that lists all the pages you want search engines to index) Creating a robots.txt file (a file that tells search engines which pages on your site should be crawled) Using meta robots tags (HTML that tells search engines how to crawl, index, and display a particular page) Implementing structured data (code that helps search engines better understand your content)TipEnroll in our free video course for technical SEO.Much of technical SEO is about improving website performance and the user experience.Things like: Mobile-friendliness Core Web Vitals (a set of metrics that score your pages for user experience) HTTPS (which relates to website security)You can conduct a technical SEO audit to identify and prioritize issues on your site. Try it out now with Semrush’s Site Audit tool. You can then work to address all your “Errors” (the most severe issues, and then move on to “Warnings” and “Notices.”Link BuildingLink building is a set of practices aimed at increasing the number of links you get from relevant, quality sites. It’s important because search engines can treat these kinds of links (backlinks) as indicators of your site’s trustworthiness and quality.The idea is simple: If many authoritative pages link to a certain page, that page is also considered to be authoritative. This is why link building has always been an important part of SEO.Our backlink management course can help you learn the basics in less than an hour.TipSemrush has a variety of link building tools that help you save time and get better results.Website ArchitectureWebsite architecture is the hierarchical structure of your webpages and how they’re linked together. It affects both the user experience and your SEO performance.Here’s a visual example of website structure:A good website architecture should: Help users easily find the information they need and navigate your site smoothly Help search engines crawl and index your site efficiently and understand the relationships between your pages Distribute your page authority evenly and boost your topical authority for your target keywordsSEO Performance MonitoringBeing able to track and analyze SEO results is a vital skill.
