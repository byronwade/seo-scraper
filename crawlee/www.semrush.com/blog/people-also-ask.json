  "content": "What Is People Also Ask?People Also Ask (PAA) is a Google Search feature that shows questions related to the user’s initial search query. And often appears near the top of search engine results pages (SERPs).This feature helps users find more information about their topic without having to perform extra searches. Clicking a PAA question opens it to show a short answer. And for each answer in People Also Ask, Google has sourced the information from a specific webpage you can visit for more information.Sometimes, you might see a simple paragraph. But the answer could also include a bulleted list, a table, an image, or even a video. Why Is Google’s People Also Ask Important?People Also Ask is a type of SERP feature (a unique result that stands out from standard listings) that helps users explore topics more deeply without needing to refine their search queries. So users can find what they need more efficiently.This presents an opportunity for website owners and SEOs. Because if your website appears in both regular search results and PAA boxes, you can gain more visibility. Which can translate to more revenue.This is especially true when you consider that People Also Ask boxes appear in 51.85% of all searches, according to Semrush Sensor data from August 2024.PAA boxes are also useful for finding new keywords to target in your content.

So you can increase your visibility in search results.NoteAll basic SEO best practices apply here as well—writing compelling title tags, incorporating internal links, etc. So be sure you're following those before you get too concerned about incorporating PAA questions.1. Include PAA Questions as Headings and SubheadingsHeadings and subheadings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) convey to Google what topics your content covers.When you incorporate PAA questions as subheadings, it’s a clear signal to Google that your content is relevant to those queries. Which improves the chances of your content being featured in PAA boxes. 2. Answer the Questions DirectlyTry to answer the questions as directly as possible to make it easier for Google to match your content to the question. And increase the likelihood of your content being selected as an answer.For example, the American Osteopathic Association answers the PAA question \"What are the benefits of yoga?\" with a clear list of benefits. 3. Align with the Existing Format PAA answers can appear in various formats, such as paragraphs, bulleted lists, and numbered lists. So, it’s a good idea to analyze the format of the current answers.For instance, this answer is presented as a short paragraph.That means you should aim to replicate that style in your content. To improve your chances of being featured in the PAA box.4. Optimize Your ImagesSometimes, PAA answers include images. And optimizing your images increases the chances they'll be featured.Here are two best practices for optimizing images: Use descriptive alt text. Ensure each image has alt text that accurately describes what the image is. This helps Google understand the context of the image. Choose informative file names. Use descriptive file names such as \"benefits-of-yoga.jpg\" (rather than generic ones like \"IMG1234.jpg\") to indicate what the image's content is.Grow Your Visibility Through PAA BoxesAppearing in People Also Ask sections helps you reach more people than you otherwise would.
