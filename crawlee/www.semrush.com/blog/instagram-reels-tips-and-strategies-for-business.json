Reels are short, captivating videos you can create right in the Instagram app. Instagram provides all the creative tools you need: add music and special effects, and even stitch together multiple clips to make eye-catching content that resonates with your audience.When done well, these bite-sized videos grab attention like nothing else. On average, one Instagram Reel was seen by 73000+ users in 2024 for accounts with over 50k followers. Small businesses with less than 10,000 followers actually see the highest view rates and the most engagement on their Reels. In fact, many have grown their following by 40% just by consistently posting Reels.This article dives deep into Instagram Reels and shows you how to leverage this exciting feature to grow your brand. We'll explore everything from the basics to advanced strategies, helping you harness the power of Reels to achieve your business goals.Meanwhile, if you're looking to create videos for your Reels using AI, Social Content AI is the perfect solution. It helps you generate stunning captions, images, designs, and videos, all customized to fit your brand seamlessly. Try Social Content AI for free!What Are Instagram Reels?Instagram Reels are short, attention-grabbing videos you create within the Instagram app. You’ll find them in the ‘Reels’ tab on the Instagram app. Reels can be up to 3 minutes long, giving you plenty of time to tell a story, showcase your products, or connect with your audience. You can use them to capture your audience's attention and direct new traffic to your brand.Reels offer a ton of creative possibilities: Built-in creative tools: Add music, sound effects, filters, and more to make your Reels stand out. Dedicated Reels tab: Reels have their own section on Instagram profiles, making them easy for people to find. Designed for discovery: Instagram's algorithm actively promotes Reels to a wider audience, even those who don't already follow you.Wondering how Reels can actually fuel business growth? Think of them as a way to start a positive feedback loop: You share a Reel. It gets seen by your current followers and new audiences. People engage with your content. They like, comment, share, and even start following your page. You share another Reel. This time, it reaches an even bigger audience thanks to your increased followers and engagement.This cycle can lead to limitless growth. Reels consistently generate the highest impression rates on Instagram, regardless of how many followers you have. So whether you're just starting out or you're a well-established business, Reels can help you and spread the word about your brand!Instagram Story vs. ReelYou might be wondering how Reels are different from Instagram Stories. While both allow you to share videos and use creative tools, there are some key differences: Lifespan: Stories disappear after 24 hours, while Reels stay on your profile permanently. Reach: Reels are more likely to be seen by people who don't already follow you, thanks to the Explore tab and Instagram's algorithm. Interactive elements: Stories offer features like question boxes, which Reels don't currently have.Think of Stories as a way to connect with your existing followers in a casual, spontaneous way. Reels, on the other hand, are designed to reach and grow your audience and showcase your creativity.Instagram Post vs. ReelInstagram Posts are the traditional way to share content on the platform. They can include photos, videos, or a combination of both. These posts appear in your followers' feeds and remain on your profile.Reels, however, have their own dedicated space within Instagram (look for the Video icon). They're also more likely to be pushed by Instagram's algorithm to reach a broader audience.While Posts are great for sharing everyday moments and updates, Reels are all about entertainment and trends. They're Instagram's answer to the growing popularity of short-form video platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts.How to Create an Instagram ReelReady to make your first Reel? It's easy! Just follow these steps on your phone: Open the Instagram app and log in to your business account. Tap the \"+\" icon at the bottom of the screen. Select \"Reel.\"That’s it!Now you have a few options, as shown in this screenshot:Upload: Choose photos or videos from your phone's gallery. You can use clips up to 3 minutes long. If you upload a photo, it will automatically become a 5-second clip.Record: Use the in-app camera to record a video. You can even add some special effects while you're recording.Drafts: If you need to take a break, save your Reel as a draft and come back to it later. Just remember that drafts are stored on your phone, so delete any you don't need to free up space.Templates: Use pre-made templates to easily create Reels with a professional look. These templates often follow popular trends or themes.Made for You: Let Instagram create a Reel for you! This feature automatically selects photos from your gallery and puts them together in a Reel.❗Important Note: For the \"Made for You\" option, you'll need to allow Instagram access to your photos.How to Edit Reels on InstagramEditing is the fun part of making Instagram Reels. You can make changes directly in the app. There are two different editing options:Editing videos as you record themYou get access to several editing options you can use while recording live content. Add music from Instagram’s live music library while you record. Add special effects like party lights, glitter, or kitten stickers to your face. The options are limitless! Add a green screen (background effect), like starry nights or sunny rooms. (Works only in selfie mode as at the time of writing). Add Yours stickers to automatically tag your Reel so it shows up under a trend. For example, if MCU characters are trending, add a Reel with your favorite MCU character and the “Add Yours” sticker. Anyone on Instagram can find your Reel by filtering for the sticker. Length: Count-down timer that automatically stops recording after 30 or 90 seconds. Speed: Speed up recording (2x/3x/5x times) to create time-lapse Reels. Slow down (0.5x/0.3x) to create slow-motion animation. Video layout: This lets you record clips that play simultaneously (two or three clips side by side or two stacked vertically). Timer: You can choose a clip length from 0-30 seconds and a countdown timer of 3 or 10 seconds. The recording will start automatically when the countdown timer ends and stop when the clip length time is reached. Gesture control: Start and stop recording with hand gestures. Editing uploaded videosOnce you’ve finished recording, you’ll go into editing mode. If you upload existing clips, you can edit them by tapping the “Edit video” icon.Once there, you have a few options available: Edit (Scissors icon): You can trim existing videos or upload multiple clips and stitch them together. You can also upload images and mix video clips with images. Add audio: Add music from the Instagram library. Mix and match music clips with your video clips. You can add multiple audio clips per Reel. Add text: Any text you add will show up in your Reel. You can include various fonts, styles, and text special effects. Cliphub: Add existing GIFs anywhere in your clip to make your Reels more humorous. Add special stickers (image + text) that show up at specific points in your video—you decide when they show up. Captions: Automatically create text captions for any video dialogue. Voiceover: Record new dialog and add it to an existing clip. Volume: Adjust the volume of sounds in the clip. Filter: Add an image filter that adjusts the light effect/look of the entire clip.As you can see, there are a lot of ways you can edit and play around with your reels to make them more dynamic. As you’re editing, try to keep your audience in mind!How to Share an Instagram ReelOnce your Reel is polished and ready to go, it's time to share it with the world! Tap \"Next,\" and you'll see the sharing screen.Here's how to make sure your Reel gets the attention it deserves: Write a captivating caption: Use your caption to tell a story, ask a question, or encourage viewers to take action. Add relevant hashtags: Hashtags help people find your Reel when they're searching for specific topics. Tag people and locations: If your Reel features other people or places, tag them! Share to Facebook: Expand your reach by sharing your Reel on Facebook too. Add an AI label (if applicable): If you used AI tools to create your Reel, be transparent and add an AI label.Fine-tuning your Reel's settingsBefore you hit \"Share,\" take a moment to explore the \"More options\" menu. Here you can: Add reminders: Remind your audience about events related to your Reel. Add a fundraiser: Support a non-profit organization by linking your Reel to a fundraiser. Upload at the highest quality: Ensure your Reel looks its best by uploading it in the highest resolution. (This is generally recommended.) Control template use: Decide whether others can use your Reel as a template for their own creations. Hide like/share count: Choose whether to display the number of likes and shares your Reel receives. (This can be useful when you're starting out, and it's it's generally best to leave it on once your Reels gain traction.) Enable/translate closed captions: Make your Reel accessible to a wider audience by enabling closed captions. You can also choose to have them automatically translated.Ready to share?Once you've customized your settings, hit that \"Share\" button! But remember, there's no going back—once your Reel is live, it's live.
