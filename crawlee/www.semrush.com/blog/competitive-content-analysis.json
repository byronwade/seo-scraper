Even if you’re not new to content marketing, taking the time to compare your efforts to those of your competitors can help you stay on top of trends. You can even discover new ways to capture your audience’s attention using content. In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to do a competitive content analysis step-by-step. We’ll also show you how to identify your own content strengths and areas for improvement. We’ll discuss: What Is a Competitive Content Analysis? Why Do a Competitive Content Analysis? How to Do a Competitive Content Analysis How to Turn your Competitive Content Analysis into ActionWhat Is a Competitive Content Analysis?A competitive content analysis is the process of analyzing your competitors’ content strategies in a structured way. By breaking down the analysis into steps, it’s easier to uncover your potential competitors’ top-performing content and weak spots and identify your competitive advantages.Why Do a Competitive Content Analysis?There are many reasons to do a competitor content analysis, but the main purpose of the exercise is to help you: Benchmark your efforts: Understand how your content marketing efforts compare to others in your industry. You’ll see the type of content your target audience expects from you and how they prefer to engage with it. Find content gaps: Identify your competitors’ top-performing and low-performing content. Understand what your target audience likes (so you can do it better) and what content approaches don't get a lot of traction (so you can avoid them). Keep your content fresh: Find fresh ideas to put a creative spin on, and make sure your content efforts stand out from the crowd. How to Do a Competitive Content Analysis Ultimately, competitive content analysis will help you stay one step ahead of your competition. It will ensure that any content you create is unique and valuable for your target audience. And doing a competitive content analysis is not as difficult as you might think. In fact, we’ve created a Free Competitive Research Template with everything you need to get started. You can make a copy of this template and use it as you go through each step below.Step 1: Make a list of your competitors.When starting a competitive content analysis, begin with a list of your direct and indirect competitors. Your direct competitors are any brand, business, or person that offers the same products or services that you do. Your indirect competitors are any brand, business, or person that offers products or services that differ from yours but that could satisfy the same customer needs. They might also solve the same problem that your products or services do. You can also examine media publications. Online magazines and blogs that create content on the same topic as your brand can be a useful way to get content ideas and to find potential partnerships.Case study: Casper Let’s use Casper, a company that sells quality mattresses directly to consumers online, as an example. There are many direct competitors of Casper that sell the same product. Examples include Tuft & Needle, Leesa, Purple, Helix, and Nectar. Even Walmart and Amazon, who have both launched private “mattress-in-a-box” labels, could be considered direct competitors of Casper.Meanwhile, brands that don’t sell mattresses but offer other products or services to help people sleep better would be considered indirect competitors of Casper. For example, pillow company PlutoPillow, apps such as Calm and SleepCycle, or even consumable brands such as RemRise, The Nue Co., and Moon Juice. These businesses also aim to satisfy the same customer need: getting a better night’s sleep.You will want to put together a list of both your direct and indirect competitors. They will all have different content strategies for you to analyze.Pro tip: Use Semrush to help generate a list of your competitors. Type your domain name into the Organic Research tool, and navigate to the ‘Competitors’ tab.List of Organic Competitors for casper.comStep 2: Review your competitors’ business core and positioning.Starting with your direct competitors, you’ll want to gather basic information about them so you can better understand their goals and target audience.
