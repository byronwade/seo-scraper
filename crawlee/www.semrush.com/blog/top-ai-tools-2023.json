CraftlyWant to leverage AI but maintain the human element in editing? Then Craftly is a great option.What makes Craftly unique to other AI copywriting assistants is its use of reinforcement from real people (positive and negative feedback) when training its models. Driven by data, they have all their trainings specific to industries while injecting their tools with all the necessary formulas for success. They rotate models and trainings based on a specific user's style preference. The more you use Craftly, the better it is supposed to get.In this way, your outputs, or generated content, have a higher likelihood of sounding natural and conversational. Other AI’s that don’t include this element tend to become rambling and repetitive.Craftly supports 100+ functionalities across multiple types of communications and media, such as social media posts, long-form blogs, web copy, email outreach, ads and ecommerce, and more. For international brands and marketers with global audiences, Craftly’s ability to support 25 languages is a big draw, especially considering that the product is trained in the selected language while also being reinforced by people who speak those languages natively.Top FeaturesCraftly’s long-form Blog Builder is its core product. It helps not only generate a full draft on any topic of your choice but also gives multiple options for each section of your article. Users can also input information about their brand tone, which increases the personalization and enhances your voice throughout the piece.Another core differentiator from other AI copywriters or the technology itself is that you tend to lose quality, especially for long-form requests. As the AI rambles onward, it opens up the potential for randomization. Craftly, conversely, gets ahead of this with their long-form Blog Builder by stacking their hyper-trained tools in the background to generate short-form quality in long-form format.For writers who want many options in picking their ideal message, Craftly’s technology hits the sweet spot between leveraging the power of AI and finessing it with the human touch.PricingCraftly operates on a word-count basis, giving users a few options. The Starter subscription provides 20K word credits at $29 per month. The Crafter subscription, tailored to writers and small business owners, gets 70K word credits for $69 per month. Enterprise-level subscriptions are priced individually based on the number of seats, custom word count, and individualized training. It also comes with a 5-day free trial.We snagged our readers 40% off for 12 months if you want to try it. Enter the special code SEMGIVES40OFF to start leveraging Craftly.Semrush SEO Writing AssistantAt Semrush, we’ve developed several tools using AI to help content marketers streamline and optimize their efforts.The SEO Writing Assistant (SWA) allows writers to optimize their content based on their targeted keywords and the search engine results page (SERPs). By inputting your content directly on the Semrush interface or using one of the integrations (Google Docs, Microsoft Word Add-On, or WordPress plugin), you can access recommendations for improving content and optimization in real-time. Additionally, the tool has parameters for readability and tone of voice, and can detect plagiarism from across the web. After analyzing your content, SWA provides a score out of 10 with a list of recommendations to optimize and refine your piece.Top FeaturesSWA also has the Expander, Paraphrasing, Summarize, and Simplifier— features that instantly generate original, error-free copy using its AI-powered algorithm.

To access clarity, vocabulary, and tone improvements, the Premium subscription costs $12 per month.

This can be one or two short sentences. You can even direct the bot on tone, topics to avoid, and other references to generate copy.Developed by Open AI, ChatGPT uses large language models (LLMs) to produce surprisingly conversational texts. LLMs are trained to predict what kinds of words are most likely to follow each other in a sentence.Users have leveraged ChatGPT for a variety of purposes, from essays to songs, poems, social media posts, and more. However, conversations in the industry have spoken about its ability to cause real-world harm, as its outputs cannot be held as truth and have the ability to harness bias and problematic thinking.Top FeaturesContent creators can leverage ChatGPT for inspiration, though its outputs aren’t entirely “original.” Rather, they’re based on existing content gathered from other sources. However, the tool can help your content rank better by helping you optimize featured snippets and FAQ-style content. Many developers are also looking at this technology to assist in routine coding applications and other manual tasks. PricingChatGPT is currently free as it claims to be gathering feedback during its research preview time.Learn moreJasper AIJasper AI is an AI copywriter that can help generate high-converting copy for ads, blog posts, landing pages, and other marketing materials through a few short prompts.The tool claims to cut down the content production time 10X and users receive 100% plagiarism-free, unique content.

Learn moreAI and Digital Marketing Long Term: Thoughts and Future Consequences?Just like any digital marketing tool, AI shouldn’t be seen as a replacement for human writers, designers, or content creators. Rather, it’s a way to increase productivity and help automate more routine tasks.In this way, AI has the potential to free up more of our time so we can delegate it to more creative work.Nonetheless, many AI’s produce outputs based on reformulated statements and content people have already thought of and published. To date, it doesn’t have the ability to generate purely original ideas, much less determine if they’re worth pursuing. ChatGPT would agree with this, too.We’ll see how creative people and marketers use these technologies and determine the best use cases. For now, we think AI is worth testing out to see how it can simplify and alleviate common pain points for marketers.",
