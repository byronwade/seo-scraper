  "content": "What Is a Meta Description?A meta description tag is an HTML element that provides a short summary of a webpage. It can appear as a snippet below the page’s URL and title in Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs). Google automatically generates a snippet of your pages based on the search query, the content on the page, and the page’s meta description. Whichever Google believes most adequately addresses the user’s search intent. Which means:Your meta descriptions should be unique, descriptive, and relevant to the page.Here’s what a meta description can look like on a SERP:To provide a meta description for a page, add it in the <head> section of each page’s code. Within a meta description tag, like so:<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Learn how to develop a tone of voice for your brand and use our template to get started.\">Most content management systems (CMSs) and SEO plugins allow you to add and edit HTML meta descriptions by typing in a designated field.Here’s an example from WordPress:NoteShort descriptions can also appear in link previews on social media and other platforms. These are usually taken from the Open Graph tag called the “og:description.” If you don’t supply one, the platform might display your HTML meta description (a type of meta tag) instead.Further reading: SERPs: Search Engine Results Pages Explained What Are SERP Features? An In-Depth GuideAre Meta Descriptions Important for SEO?Meta descriptions are really important for SEO. Even though they aren’t a direct ranking factor.They’re used to generate snippets that tell searchers about your page. And help you stand apart from competitors on the SERP.An effective snippet convinces more people to click on your link, increasing your click-through rate (CTR) and brand awareness. Both of which are primary goals of most SEO efforts. Also, Google may bold keywords from the query (or other highly relevant text) that are found in your meta description. This helps users to scan results and find pages that match their needs. Thus increasing CTR.Like this:Of course, it’s best to control your site’s snippets as much as possible. So you can protect your branding. That’s why you need to write effective meta descriptions.Further reading: What Are Rich Snippets & How to Get ThemShould You Set Meta Descriptions on Every Page?Setting meta descriptions for all your pages is a good idea. But not always mandatory.Google doesn’t always use your meta descriptions. Because it auto-generates snippets based on user queries or information from the page.If Google believes your HTML meta description doesn’t satisfy the searcher’s intent, it may generate a different snippet for you.For example, when we searched for “what does SEO stand for,” Google displayed the meta description written by our team:But when we searched “what is SEO,” Google replaced the SEO meta description with more relevant text from the page:When Google does display your meta description, it’s an opportunity for you to feature a compelling and clickable snippet. By always providing a meta description, you have a better chance of controlling the narrative. However, setting a meta description for every page can be time-consuming. If you’re pressed for time, prioritize key landing pages, product pages, and any content that you want to rank.If you really don’t want Google to display a snippet (auto-generated or otherwise), use the “nosnippet” meta tag. This tells Google not to show any text or image preview for that page in the SERPs. TipYou can quickly check if your site has missing or duplicate meta descriptions with Site Audit. Just run an audit, head to the “Issues” tab and write “meta description” in the search bar. Further reading: Meta Robots Tag & X-Robots-Tag ExplainedHow to Write an SEO Meta Description (+ Best Practices)Use the following best practices to write better meta descriptions.1. Keep Meta Descriptions to 105 Characters (or 680 Pixels) in LengthWondering how long should a meta description be?We recommend a meta description length of 680 pixels or around 105 characters. This gives you space to write an effective summary. While reducing the risk of truncation in the SERP.While there isn’t technically a length limit on an HTML meta description, Google truncates snippets based on the amount of space available. And truncated meta descriptions can hurt your CTR.Like in this meta description example:Generally, Google cuts off meta descriptions at around 960 pixels (approximately 152 characters) on desktop. And 680 pixels (approximately 105 characters) on mobile. You might see higher estimations out there—155 characters is a common meta description length recommendation.The exact number of characters displayed in a snippet depends on various factors, such as: The user’s device (e.g., there’s more space on desktop than mobile) The width of the characters (e.g., an “m” uses more pixels than an “i”) The user’s search query (i.e., words take up more pixels when bolded)TipKeep important information close to the start of your meta description. To grab readers’ attention and avoid important information getting truncated.2. Include Your Target KeywordEach meta description should include the page’s primary keyword—the main search query you want the page to rank for.This won’t affect your SEO directly. But it can encourage users to click. Especially because Google often bolds words that appear in or are synonyms of the query.Let’s say you want to rank for “best trail running shoes.”In this meta description, the phrase isn’t mentioned specifically. So, searchers might not think the page is relevant.This next SEO meta description stands out more due to the bolding. And explicitly addresses the searcher’s needs.Further reading: How to Choose Keywords for SEO (A 5-Step Guide)3. Give the User What They Want to SeeUnderstanding search intent (what the searcher wants to achieve) is key to writing an effective meta description.When someone searches for “buy iphone,” Apple entices users to click through by talking about trade-ins and low monthly payments.When someone searches for “compare iphones,” Apple lets users know they can examine various models.Like so:Note how Google rewrites the meta description for this iPhone 14 specifications page. Because searchers want details—not a vague summary.Perform search intent analysis before writing meta descriptions. So that you can assure searchers you have what they’re looking for.Further reading: What Is Search Intent? A Complete Guide4. Include a Call to ActionCalls to action (CTAs) tell searchers what they should do next. Use them in your HTML meta descriptions to prompt clicks.For example: Shop online Learn more Try for freeCTAs are imperative sentences—they start with a verb and encourage readers to take action. Direct writing can make meta descriptions more concise, engaging, and persuasive.Consider this before and after, for example:Before: Luggage, travel accessories, and more are available on our website. Complimentary monogramming can be accessed with any purchase.After: Shop online for premium luggage & travel accessories. Get FREE monogramming with purchase.Include CTAs in your meta descriptions to get more clicks. Further reading: What Is a Call-to-Action? CTA Meaning & Their Importance Click-Through Rate (CTR): Definition, Formula, and Tips5. Ensure Every Meta Description Is UniqueWrite a unique meta description for every page that might appear in Google (i.e., indexable pages).That way, you can tell users exactly what each page is about. And maximize your CTR.Generic, duplicate meta descriptions don’t add value. And they definitely don’t describe what you’ll find on a specific page.Like this:If you don’t have time to write meta descriptions manually, you can use AI writing tools like ContentShake AI to automate this process.Or prioritize writing meta descriptions for the most important pages until you have time to write the rest.6. Include Important Product InformationIf you are writing a meta description for a product page, you should provide information about the product’s features, benefits, and key stats.This way, users know that they’re clicking on the result that matches their intent and expectations.A good meta description for a product page should mention the following: The product name and model number The product price and any discounts or offers The product features and benefits The product availability and shipping optionsBy including these details, you can make your meta description more relevant and appealing to potential customers. For example, here is a meta description optimized for a product page:This meta description gives users a clear overview of the product and its specifications. Users who are looking for this type of shoes will be more likely to click on this result than on a generic one that doesn’t provide any product information.Meta Description ToolsUse these meta description tools to save time and boost your organic CTR: Site Audit: Check your site for missing and duplicate meta descriptions On Page SEO Checker: See if Google is rewriting your meta descriptions Google / Keyword Overview: Review your competitors’ snippets SplitSignal: Perform A/B tests on your meta descriptions To The Web’s SERP Preview Tool: Measure meta description length Site AuditSite Audit checks your site for various technical SEO issues.
