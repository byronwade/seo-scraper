Influencer MarketingInfluencer marketing involves collaborating with creators who have engaged online audiences. While these partnerships are promotional in nature, influencers tend to promote brands in more genuine ways.One of the biggest benefits of influencer marketing is its perceived authenticity. Because instead of branded content, influencers use personal stories and create lifestyle content.Brands typically partner with influencers who have authority in relevant niches. For example, a health food brand may work with an influencer who specializes in health, wellness, or fitness.In the Instagram post below, an influencer introduces the haircare brand Native to her audience:Find the right influencers to promote your brand using Influencer Analytics from Semrush.

Affiliate MarketingAffiliate marketing is a digital marketing technique that involves recruiting people (affiliates) to promote your company’s products or services. Affiliates use content, social media, email, video, and other types of digital marketing to create promotional campaigns on your behalf.Generally, affiliates receive commissions for any sales that result from their marketing efforts. To attribute sales accurately, companies typically give affiliates unique referral links or discount codes.Let’s take the Instagram post below. Where an affiliate marketer models Gymshark apparel and mentions an affiliate code for the athletic brand:A major perk of affiliate marketing is its focus on sales. If your marketing goals focus on conversions, affiliate marketing may be a better choice than influencer marketing.9.

Public Relations (PR)PR agencies use channels like news outlets, social media, and targeted outreach to generate earned media.A major benefit of PR is that it can improve your brand’s visibility across digital marketing channels, including social media, search, and content marketing.While PR professionals can’t control earned media, they can influence it. Common tactics include issuing press releases and making connections with members of the press.Take a look at this Investopedia article referencing an earnings report by Netflix’s PR team.A successful PR strategy involves generating more positive brand mentions online. Use the Brand Monitoring app to track mentions of your organization, executives, products, or services across the web and social media platforms.Brand Monitoring automatically analyzes sentiment and labels your mentions as positive, neutral, or negative. So you can quickly assess how the press, influencers, and customers feel about your brand.Then, you can identify the PR efforts that drive the most positive sentiment. And find issues that contribute to negative sentiment so you can work to improve your online reputation.11.

Virtual Reality (VR) MarketingVR marketing uses immersive virtual environments for promotional purposes. It typically requires people to wear headsets that create interactive, 360-degree environments.For example, Meta Horizon Worlds is a virtual world that users can access via Meta Quest headsets. Brands can build virtual environments in Horizon Worlds or partner with influencers to promote their products and services.Fast food restaurant chain Wendy’s opened the Wendyverse in Meta Horizon Worlds, giving visitors an opportunity to engage virtually with the brand.One of the biggest benefits of VR marketing is its novelty. The VR space is less crowded than most other digital spaces on this list, which may allow early adopters to leverage it for considerable gain.Pro tip​​​​​​Find ways to harness AI and other latest marketing practices in our free 2024 Trends Report.However, the adoption of VR technology is also lower than most other options on this list. As a result, the potential audience brands can reach with VR marketing is more limited.13. AI MarketingAI marketing uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to communicate with customers.Many AI marketing tools are designed to respond to user input. They use natural language processing (NLP) to understand both the content and the context of human input.Some of the most common types of AI marketing include: Chatbots that answer questions and provide customer service Personal assistants (like Google Assistant) that can have two-way conversations Personalized marketing content based on users’ preferences and past behaviorsIn fact, personalization is one of the biggest perks of AI marketing.
