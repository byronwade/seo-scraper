GBP posts are quick updates that allow business owners to share news, offers, and product details directly on their Google page. They pop up on Google Search and Google Maps, giving customers the latest information on your business.You can post about: An unmissable deal An upcoming event Product highlightsIn this blog post, we discuss how to create posts that keep customers engaged on your Google profile, boost local search rankings, and grow foot traffic to your stores. Where Do Google Business Profiles Show Up and What Do They Look Like?Your Google Business Profile is like a digital snapshot of your business. Appearing when people look your company up on Google Search or Maps. If you search for “yoga classes NYC USA” in Google, here’s what shows up:When you click on a yoga studio from the above list, you’ll land on its Google Business Profile page. Where you’ll see all the relevant details in one spot—including photos, reviews, and posts from the business.Further reading: ‘How Do I Add My Business to Google?’ A Step-by-Step GuideGoogle Business Profile posts are like mini advertisements or bulletins. Going back to our example, yoga businesses can use them to alert patrons about additional classes, introduce a new instructor, or provide details about workshops. Here’s why GBP posts matter: Show and tell: Posts can include attention-grabbing text, photos, or videos—perfect for brand storytelling. Plus share timely, regular updates on what’s new and upcoming to draw more customers in and keep them informed. Get noticed: Profile posts are valuable because they appear on your company’s Google page, where users are already looking. Your business can attract more eyeballs for longer with well-crafted, engaging post content.4 Types of Google Business Profile PostsThe four main types of GBP posts are updates, offers, events, and product-related. Let’s take a closer look at each of these, outlining when and how to use them. 1. Update PostAn update post informs customers about your latest news or changes to your business. Let’s take the update post on the City University of New York (CUNY)’s GBP as an example. It lists the types of degree programs it offers and extends an open invitation to events during CUNY Month.NoteGoogle may not approve posts that contain phone numbers, preferring users to contact businesses via the information provided in the GBP business listing. This helps ensure a consistent and secure user experience. Read more about GBP’s content policy here.2. Offer PostA GBP offer post is a great way to promote your limited-edition products, special deals and discounts, or sales events. The Pie Hole’s “Death by Chocolate” desserts offer a great example of content you could share in an offer post. See how the California-based pie and coffee business announced final orders for its seasonal specials:Grab your audience’s attention to limited-edition or seasonal products, discounts on bestsellers, or special deals exclusive to loyal customers.3. Event PostImagine you’re hosting an upcoming gala opening, a musical evening, or a seminar. Promoting it with an event post on GBP can encourage greater participation. Treat these messages as virtual invitations. Share all the event details, including the date, time, location, and what attendees can expect. Here’s an example of a click-through event post for a Halloween event:The UK theme park Pleasurewood Chills didn’t just use an event post as an invitation. It added a timeline to create FOMO (fear of missing out) and a timely sense of urgency—an effective strategy to capture its audience’s interest. You’ll potentially increase click-through rates (CTR) as viewers feel compelled to act quickly. The CTR metric gauges the frequency at which users click on your link when Google serves your post to searchers. Reflecting immediate user engagement with your content in real-time. NoteA higher CTR often means your post is making more people interested and likely to take action—boosting site visits and conversions as a result.4. Product PostProduct posts provide visitors with a visual representation of your product or service offerings.Let’s take health and wellness brand Nicholas Brooklyn. Its product posts showcase items with prices included to promote transparency and visibility.Use product posts to spotlight: New additions to your range Your most popular products Services that make your business stand outPro tipHigh-impact quality images grab attention and show off your products. Clear descriptions explain what you offer. Storytelling connects with customers so they’re more likely to engage with your business. Together, these elements make your product posts stand out and encourage actions—such as visiting your store and purchasing.10 GBP Post Ideas for Your BusinessHere are 10 ideas for creating eye-catching Google Business Profile posts to boost your engagement and conversion potential. 1. Special Offers and DiscountsEveryone loves a good deal, and special offers or limited-time coupon codes create immediate interest. These types of posts can help you drive higher conversion rates. Create a sense of urgency through promotions with specified end dates, such as flash sales or exclusive limited-time discounts. A good example is when Dunkin’ Donuts announced a special $1 donut offer when purchasing a medium or large coffee.2. Street View, 360° Views, and Virtual ToursIntegrating various visual experiences into your Google Business Profile (GBP) can enhance audience engagement. Each type of visual offers a unique perspective of your business.For example, we used the virtual tour enhancement to give a quick peek into our Semrush office:Although you can’t embed such visuals directly into GBP posts, here are some ways to reference and promote these features: Create a GBP post referring to your visuals: Craft a post that encourages viewers to check out your 360° View or Virtual Tour. For example, by announcing a new virtual tour available on your profile and inviting customers to explore it. Include a call to action (CTA): Invite users to visit your GBP listing to experience your Virtual Tour or view 360° imagery with a compelling CTA that directs them to where they can find these features. Use engaging images: Use captivating static images related to your different visual views in your GBP posts. Like including a well-shot photo from your Virtual Tour as a teaser. Regular updates: Keep your audience engaged with regular GBP posts on new or updated Virtual Tours, plus posts highlighting different aspects of your 360° Views.And here are these four tips in practice:3. New Products or ServicesRegularly updating your audience about new products or services is not just about sharing information but a strategy to engage customers and encourage them to revisit your business. For example, a new yoga class pricing package.The update post from Hot Yoga Chelsea serves a dual purpose. It informs the existing customer base about new options and attracts potential customers looking for flexible pricing.4. Reviews and Customer StoriesWhile directly posting Google reviews as a GBP post isn’t possible, you can creatively capture their essence and communicate user experiences with your audience. Repurpose Google reviews with relatable narratives and authentic customer experiences into GBP posts. Positive, real-world experiences are highly likely to validate your value proposition and foster trust. Here are some ideas for crafting engaging GBP posts inspired by customer stories and reviews. Thematic roundup posts: Use themes or positive sentiments from your reviews to create roundup posts. Like a post highlighting customer service excellence or product quality as described in your reviews. Success stories inspired by reviews: Share customer success stories or experiences that align with the positive feedback in your reviews. While not direct quotes, these narratives can echo the feedback expressed by your customers. Encouraging review exploration: Create posts that encourage potential customers to read your Google reviews for a comprehensive understanding of what makes your business unique.Here’s an example of how to use a customer testimonial to craft a GBP post summarizing a positive brand experience.This approach indirectly highlights the positive feedback while adhering to GBP’s guidelines. It can be a creative way to communicate customer satisfaction while enhancing your GBP presence.5. User-Generated Content (UGC)Using user-generated content (UGC) in your GBP posts can be an effective way to showcase your brand’s authenticity. And to connect with current and potential customers. UGC—including customer reviews, photos, and experiences—can offer a genuine perspective on your products or services.Further reading: How User-Generated Content Can Help Your Content StrategyTo incorporate UGC into your GBP posts: Encourage more UGC: Use GBP posts to encourage customers to share their content. Invite customers to share photos of their experiences with your products or services—then reuse the customer content in future posts. Celebrate UGC contributions: Acknowledge and thank customers who contribute to UGC, showing appreciation for their engagement. This can foster a sense of community and encourage further participation.Consider a restaurant, which has successfully attracted patrons through customer-shared images. While direct posting of customer images to GBP isn’t possible, it could create engaging posts that encourage more customer contributions. For instance, it might create a roundup post using UGC food images titled, “5 Times We Considered Hiring Our Customers as Our Photographers.” This approach not only showcases customer contributions, but also adds a fun and personal touch to the restaurant’s GBP presence.NoteGoogle can limit UGC-like photos and reviews for places because of abuse or irrelevant content. Restrictions may be short-term or long-term and may affect all or specific types of UGC. Check the Google Maps User Contributed Policy for details.6. Seasonal ContentEmbrace seasonal trends and holiday spirit in your GBP posts so your business remains relevant throughout the year. Create timely content that resonates with your audience’s current interests by sharing special promotions, events, or seasonal offerings.Seasonal content isn’t just limited to specific holidays. It also reflects yearly changes—think fall, summer, and winter time. Align your promotions and messaging with the mood and activities typical of each season.American coffeehouse chain Blank Street Coffee used this strategy to announce its winter specials. Such seasonal connections can renew interest and make your brand part of customer traditions.7. Educational PostsDemonstrate your industry knowledge and skills by sharing informative content, educational posts, tips, and advice relevant to your sector. This practice can establish your brand as an authority in your field. It may also build trust with your audience, and set you apart from competitors.For example, UK-based bathroom retailer Royal Bathrooms sets itself apart by sharing expert tips with the community on GBP. Google values content that demonstrates expertise and authoritativeness. You too can improve your business’s visibility in search results by sharing similar content in your GBP posts.8. Changes to Your BusinessIt’s important to always keep your audience informed on business changes. Whether it’s new opening hours, relocations, or policy changes.Something as simple as sharing the latest menu at your coffee shop can pique customer curiosity and potentially increase in-store visits. In this GBP post, coffee company Roasting Plant keeps its customers updated by sharing the changes made to its pricing. 9. Showcase AchievementsLooking to build trust in your brand? Highlight your big business wins directly on your GBP.Post your victories and share customer success stories to help you grow your credibility across Google Search and Google Maps. A well-crafted GBP post featuring your milestones will indicate quality and reliability. It tells potential clients, “We deliver results.”Below, law firm Morgan & Morgan celebrates a substantial verdict win, spotlighting its team’s dedication and hard work. It’s not just about the numbers, but also a valuable message of commitment and justice.10. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)Use your GBP as a platform to address questions people might have during their customer journey. Providing helpful answers will potentially eliminate barriers to conversion.Your audience should then have an easier time connecting with your brand, understanding your products, and eventually buying. This is how you go about addressing customer FAQs: Identify common questions: Collaborate with your customer service or sales team to pinpoint frequent queries and common pain points. Answer them in purposely crafted GBP posts: Use these insights to communicate clear, helpful answers concerning a product feature or service process, for instance. Enhance connection and understanding: Create GBP posts that make it easier for your audience to connect with your brand and understand your offerings. Which may lead to increased sales.Here’s an example of how to seem approachable and responsive to consumer needs:While it might have a dedicated FAQ section, its GBP post covering a commonly asked question demonstrates an eagerness to meet customer needs.How to Schedule GBP PostsNow that you have some great Google My Business post examples, let’s discuss how to schedule them.The process done right ensures consistency.

Effective optimization ensures your posts are crafted to maximize visibility and engagement from the outset. Businesses that don’t consider this usually end up asking, Why are our brand’s Google My Business posts not working? This can be frustrating, but thankfully, you know that optimizing your posts is the answer to start seeing results.Enhance your GBP posts for maximum visibility and engagement with the below tips.1. WordsUse keywords to enhance your business profile’s visibility and search rankings, but don’t make your posts too long. Include keywords that are relevant to your business and audience. They should naturally fit into the content, reflecting the terms potential customers might use when searching for your services or products.There’s a 1,500-character limit, but that doesn’t mean your posts need to reach full capacity every time. While it’s tempting to use up all the available space, keeping your message short and to the point can attract customers’ attention more effectively. TipFor effective SEO, add relevant keywords throughout your GBP—not just your posts. Our step-by-step guide shows you how to do it effectively. In the example below, a yoga business effectively targets the keyword “meditation workshop” in its offer post. Image Source: Google for Small BusinessThe keyword choice not only caters to those searching for exact-match and related keywords like “meditation classes.” It also aims to reach audiences using long-tail, high-intent keywords like “meditation workshop near me.” A keyword-focused strategy within a succinct post has the potential to broaden your reach while maintaining clarity and relevance.Further reading: What Is Keyword Intent & How to Align Keywords with User NeedsCustomers on Google seek quick facts, clear answers, and simple explanations.

Effective communication starts with word choice. Strive for a balance: be concise yet informative. Craft your GBP posts so they’re engaging and action-driven—like a concise Google Ad. This approach can significantly increase customer interaction and conversions. 2. ImagesImages can be powerful. And the choice and quality of your images in your Google Business Profile (GBP) posts can significantly influence user engagement. Posting professional photos across your GBP can potentially lead to increased website clicks. So, remember to select images that align well with each GBP post you publish. Focus on: Relevance: Choose images that directly relate to the content of your post. Whether it’s showcasing a new product, highlighting a special offer, or promoting an event, the image should complement and reinforce your message. Quality: High-quality, clear, well-lit photos make your post more appealing. Ensure your images reflect true-to-life colors, and avoid heavy editing or excessive filters. A professional look: Consider using professional photos wherever possible to elevate the perceived quality of your products or services.Consider Royal Bathrooms’ use of professional photos in its GBP posts to highlight one of its collections. High-quality images offer a crisp, attractive depiction of their premium bathroom fixtures. Simultaneously enticing potential customers to explore further and contributing to the brand’s visual appeal.For optimal display on Google, adhere to GBP photo specifications across your profile and posts.3. VideosGBP video posts can be invaluable for generating interest in your brand. Videos that tell your story or showcase customer testimonials can drive higher engagement on your page. So create concise, captivating videos to introduce your business, products, or services. New York’s Ray’s Candy Store does this quite often. In one video, it ties in Valentine’s Day with the idea of candy made with love.To insert videos into your posts, comply with the following GBP criteria: Length: No longer than 30 seconds Maximum file size: 75 MB Minimum resolution: 720 pixels4. LinksIncorporating relevant links in your Google Business Profile (GBP) posts is a strategic way to engage users and encourage specific actions.

Which gives businesses a considerable time frame to engage with their audience and showcase important updates.NoteFor the most current information on post visibility and any recent changes to GBP policies, refer directly to Google’s Support Page for GBP Posts.

How can I measure the effectiveness of my GBP posts? The short answer is you can’t—at least not at this time. Google does not provide specific analytics for each post. Instead, businesses should focus on monitoring their overall GBP performance for insights into online engagement and customer interactions. The “Performance” tab in GBP lets you evaluate metrics like search queries, device usage, calls, messages, bookings, direction requests, and website clicks. Collectively, these offer a comprehensive view of your GBP’s impact.Semrush’s Listing Management—specifically its Map Rank Tracker app—can help you gauge the effectiveness of your GBP efforts.

The tool adjusts your post to meet the standard display criteria of different social platforms, including GBP. NoteSocial Poster primarily ensures compliance with these platforms’ formatting rules rather than show device-specific or browser-specific variations.Checking your post manually on different devices and browsers is always recommended. This will ensure your content looks good everywhere. How often should I share a post on my GBP?A good rule of thumb for maintaining an active and engaging Google Business Profile is to post regularly. While there's no one-size-fits-all approach, many businesses find that posting once a week keeps their profile fresh and relevant. If you have more content to share, consider two to three GBP posts a week to keep your audience informed about your latest updates, offers, and events.Regular activity can help your profile stand out and increase engagement. To make things easier for you, consider using efficient scheduling tools like Social Poster.
