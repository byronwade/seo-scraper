Learn the Fundamentals of SEOWhen trying to gain SEO experience and become an SEO expert, one of the most important things to do is to learn the basics.Keyword ResearchKeyword research identifies and analyzes the terms and phrases people use while searching for information, products, or services on search engines.It’s an important SEO skill to learn because it directly affects search engine rankings.Some different aspects of keyword research include: Finding different types of keywords Using long-tail keywords Keyword mapping Keyword clustering Using keyword research toolsBy knowing which keywords and phrases are most relevant to a website’s content or business, you can make targeted SEO campaigns to rank for those specific terms.Understanding search intent is another significant aspect of keyword research.Why?Because you need to provide the right information and meet the needs of your target audience if you want to consistently rank well, build trust, and boost conversions.By understanding the four main types of search intent (informational, navigational, commercial, and transactional), SEO experts can optimize content in a way that meets users’ needs.Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool is a great place to start with keyword research. You can explore your niche and find long-tail keywords that are related semantically and broken up into subgroups relevant to your industry.Start with a seed keyword:Next, hit “Search,” and the tool will bring up suggested keywords, their intent, and search volume.Pay attention to the “Match Modifiers,” which let you make the keyword selection more or less specific.Further Reading: How to Use Semrush for Keyword ResearchOn-Page SEOOn-page SEO refers to anything you can do on-site to improve your search engine rankings and/or visibility.
