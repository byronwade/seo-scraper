Define Your Goals & AudienceBefore creating any content, you need to know two things: your goals and your audience.Your goals are the specific outcomes you want to achieve with your content marketing. For example, you might want to increase site traffic by a certain percentage or drive a specific number of leads in support of a larger company goal. Your audience is the group of people you want to reach with your content.For example, you might want to target bloggers in the food industry or recent college graduates seeking internships.This step is critical.And here’s why: Defining your goals and audience guides your entire content strategy A solid strategy helps create content likely to resonate with your audience Impactful, relevant content leads to better ROIYou can quickly find your target audience by analyzing competitor audiences with One2Target. Enter up to five competitors’ domains, and the tool will gather information about their audiences’ demographics, socioeconomics, and behavior. Like this: Here are some additional steps you can take to define your goals and audience: Review your current performance. What are your strengths and weaknesses? What are your opportunities and threats? Create your ideal customer personas. Who are they? What are their pain points, needs, and desires? How can you help them? Conduct a competitor analysis. Who are your main competitors? What are they doing well and poorly? How can you differentiate yourself from them? Set the right types of goals. Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals make it easy to see whether you’re on track. For example, a SMART goal could be: “Increase organic traffic by 50% in the next six months.” Choose key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure progress. For example, common KPIs for content marketing are sessions, bounce rate, average engagement time, social shares, email subscribers, etc.Further reading: Target Audience: What It Is & How to Find Yours [+ Examples] 16 Marketing KPIs You Need to Monitor2. Choose the Right Content FormatsYou’ve defined your goals and audience. Now, you need to choose the best content types for your content marketing efforts.We discussed some of these earlier, including: Blog posts Ebooks Videos Podcast episodes Webinars Case studies Social media postsDon’t know where to start?A great way is to reverse-engineer your competitors’ content strategies. See what’s working for them and replicate it in a better way. Open Organic Research, enter any competitor’s domain, and head to the “Pages” tab. This is a list of your competitor’s pages, conveniently sorted by the estimated amount of organic traffic they bring in. Click the icon next to the URL to see the actual page:Browse through several of their top pages. And repeat this process for your main competitors. As you do this, look for patterns.For example: Do they use lots of visual assets? Is the content mostly long-form or short-form? Are the URLs mostly landing pages, ebooks, case studies, or something different?Follow a similar process using Social Tracker to see what kinds of social media content your competitors post. And what resonates with their audiences the most.Again, review the content to look for patterns and ask questions. Then, use the answers to guide your content choices.Here are some additional tips for deciding which content types to use: Align content types with your goals. Different content types have different purposes and benefits. For example, blog posts are great for driving traffic, ebooks are great for generating leads, and videos are great for increasing engagement. Align content types with audience segments. Some content types appeal to different segments. For example, some audiences prefer visual content, some prefer audio content, and some prefer interactive content. Experiment and optimize. You don’t need to stick to one content type. In fact, you shouldn’t. Mix and match to see what works best. Track KPIs and adjust accordingly.Further reading: 17 Types of Content Marketing to Use for Success3.
