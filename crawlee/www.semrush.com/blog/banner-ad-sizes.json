In fact, banner ads are so common that the average person sees over 1,700 banner ads per month. In such a competitive space, marketers have to have intentional ad strategies that factor in all design aspects of a banner ad, including size.Digital advertising is similar to printed advertising, where standard banner sizes allow brands to advertise on billboards and other spaces in public. Online, publishers provide specific units for digital ads, and these units typically have size specifications that are determined by the Interactive Advertising Bureau.Knowing and designing ads based on standard sizes means that all components of your ad are visible on a page (you don’t spend time having to edit designs retroactively) and that you have a granular understanding of the online ad world.Standard ad sizes are widely accepted and have played a part in the effectiveness of banner ads. Brands that therefore follow standard ad sizes have a higher chance of a successful ad campaign.Common Banner SizesWeb banners are ads that feature on blogs, ecommerce sites, and digital publications. The most common network to place these types of ads is the Google Display Network. These ads can be used to increase traffic to a targeted landing page, increase brand awareness, and increase brand revenue.Web banner sizesThere are five common sizes for Google Display banner ads.1. Leaderboard (728 x 90 ad size)A Leaderboard banner ad has a 728 pixels width and a 90 pixels height; it can also be called a Super banner. This type of ad banner is normally at the top of an online page, and so is one of the first things that users see.Leaderboard ads are favorable because they are so visible and immediately draw people’s attention. Subsequently, there’s a higher chance that leaderboard ads will be clicked on and encourage conversions. Leaderboard ads are positioned above the fold on web pages (the line where users have to begin scrolling to view more of the page) and so are effective because they are readily seen before users begin navigating.2. Large rectangle (336 x 280 ad size)The large rectangle ad was delisted by the IAB as it was not often accommodated on ad networks. The ad would sit on the side of content in the shape of a large rectangle, and saw relative success as a banner.3. Medium rectangle (300 x 250 ad size)A medium rectangle ad is the smaller version of the now delisted large rectangle ad. It has a height of 300 pixels with a 250-pixel width. It is also known as an MPU or Med Rec ad.Medium rectangle ads are popular with marketers because they are useful for both desktop and mobile advertising, and have sufficient space for brands to tell a story without being too consuming on pages.4. Mobile banner (300 x 50 ad size)Mobile banners are 300 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall, and appear on mobile devices. They are one of the smaller ad sizes available, and are reasonably priced. Naturally, the smaller sizing means that brands have less space to include ad copy, images, and interactive media in these ads, however, they can produce big ROI if curated well. They tend to feature at the top or bottom of mobile screens.5. Wide SkyscraperWhile these are the standard sizes of web banners, the format of each ad can be different. For example, ads can be static, animated, interactive, expandable, pop-up or transitional. Whatever dynamic you choose for your ad, try to design with one of the above five sizes in mind.Factors to Consider When Choosing Banner SizesThere are a few things to take into account when selecting the right banner size for your ad and brand. These factors can have a big impact on your ads’ performance, as well as how the ad looks on the page, and how easy it is to read and understand. Before deciding your banner size, think about these elements: Target audienceWho your ad is talking to should play a big role in the size of your banner. The demographics and behaviors of your target audience will change how people engage with your ad and should determine how the ad is formatted and sized. For example, younger audiences may respond better to small, more discreet banners that don’t disrupt the flow of the user experience. Old demographics may prefer larger banners that are clearer and more obvious in their positioning.Similarly, if your target audience most commonly uses Facebook, you may want to research the most popular banner sizes for Facebook ads in order to best resonate with the desired people. Your audience will tell you their preferred platform, and the platform should inform the banner size you choose.Banner placementWhere an ad appears has a direct correlation to its success. Placement affects visibility, click-through rates, and the overall effectiveness of an ad campaign. You should consider what platforms your target audiences use, and prioritize ad banners on these platforms. Likewise, where on the page your ad shows can help yield better results. For instance, native advertising – where banner ads seamlessly integrate with surrounding content – can feel less intrusive to audiences and bring positive results. Alternatively, placing banner ads at strategic points of the customer journey can increase the chance of conversions.BudgetAds cost money and unsurprisingly, your banner ad strategy will be driven by your company budget. Popular platforms and high traffic websites tend to have higher advertising costs, however, if that is where your target audience primarily are, it may be worth the investment. Spend time assessing the cost per impression or click across different platforms and try to allocate your budget accordingly to ensure optimal reach without overspending. Remember to track and analyze performance metrics over time to reshuffle budget allocation toward the best-performing banner ads.Your budget should be centered around your brand goals. If you’re focusing on conversions, budget should be given to ads that have proven conversions. If you’re focusing on subscribers, budget should be given to ads that inspire sign-ups. MessagingYour messaging is what tells people a story and represents your brand – it’s how you capture people’s attention and how you demonstrate that your ad has real value. Your message should be concise and read well within the space that you’ve chosen for your ad. If you have lots of text or detailed images, a bigger sized ad will be necessary.You should also consider if you want to run A/B tests to experiment with your messaging. If so, ask yourself how much will you change the messaging in your ad, and will that require a banner ad size change also? Equally, think about the context that your ad will appear in – if it’s on a platform with lots of text-heavy content, perhaps a smaller ad with animated messaging would be more attractive to users.Creating Banner Ads to Size with AIAdCreative.ai (available in the Semrush App Center) is an AI-powered platform that creates ad creatives for better conversions.
