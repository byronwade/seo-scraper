  "content": "What Are Marketing Reports?Marketing reports are static, data-focused documents that summarize key aspects of a business’s marketing performance at regular intervals. Here’s a peek at an example created with Semrush’s My Reports tool:Marketing reports usually include metrics related to: Reach: The number of people exposed to marketing efforts (e.g., ad impressions) Engagement: Positive interactions with your efforts (e.g., social media likes) Conversion: Desirable actions resulting from your efforts (e.g. purchases) Return on investment (ROI): A measure of profits as related to costsThey can provide an overview of multiple campaigns and channels or focus on one in particular. The right approach depends on your marketing strategy and resources.TipFor a real-time view of performance, you can use analytics dashboards.Why Are Marketing Reports Important?Marketing reports are important because they provide a clear, shared, and comprehensive overview of marketing performance. This helps you get buy-in from internal stakeholders and clients. After all:If you get good results but don’t communicate them, your success might not be recognized.If you get poor results and don’t address them, you might lose your colleagues’ trust.Reporting also empowers your team to make better decisions.Rather than relying on guesswork and limited datasets, marketers can get a good understanding of what’s working and what isn’t. And adapt their future efforts accordingly.Best Practices for Marketing ReportingFollow these best practices when creating your marketing reports: Be consistent. Reporting the same data types at regular intervals allows you to make useful comparisons. Take advantage of the marketing report templates and scheduling features available in My Reports. Don’t overwhelm. While you want to keep stakeholders informed, it’s important not to overwhelm them. Focus on the most important data only and avoid reporting too frequently. Address negative results. It may be tempting to exclude negative results, but this is counterproductive. Take the opportunity to learn and share an action plan. Share insights. Provide your team with any useful context, conclusions, or ideas. It’s also helpful to write a short summary of each report. Collect reliable data. Poor-quality data leads to poor-quality reports. Make sure to collect your data from trustworthy sources.When your report is ready, present it to the stakeholders personally. So you can provide additional context and answer any questions.5 Marketing Report ExamplesWe’ve created five different types of marketing report examples to inspire you.SEO Marketing ReportBelow is a snippet of an SEO marketing report created with My Reports.
