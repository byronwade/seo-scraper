  "content": "In the second quarter of 2021, Facebook had 2.89 billion users. With nearly 3 million people navigating the platform, small- and medium-sized businesses (and their marketers) have the unique opportunity to capture the attention of large targeted audiences through paid Facebook ads. When done correctly, one particular type of ad — Facebook Carousel Ads — can transform images and videos into a dynamic touchpoint between prospective customers and your business. But, are Facebook Carousel Ads right for every business? If poorly executed, can they have a negative impact on your business? Are they worth the investment? In this article, we will walk you through these considerations, demonstrate how to set up a Facebook Carousel Ad, and show you a few helpful examples. What Are Facebook Carousel Ads? Facebook Carousel Ads are a type of dynamic, interactive ad that marketers can use to showcase between 2 and 10 pictures or videos (with links) in one ad space. On mobile platforms, users can scroll through the ad’s slides with the swipe of a finger, and on a desktop platform, users can do a simple click left or right to navigate through the ad. These ads are designed to provide users with an organic experience akin to scrolling through a Facebook or Instagram story feed. Carousel Ads also appear in multiple locations across the Facebook platform, including (but not limited to), the standard Facebook feed, Stories, Audience Network, Marketplace, and Messenger — giving businesses additional saturation and exposure for their ads. Source: Bigbom Should You Use Facebook Carousel Ads for Your Business? Facebook Carousel Ads can contribute measurable value to your brand's inbound marketing strategy. However, there are some important questions to ask yourself and your team before you decide to invest in these types of paid ads: Do you have the budget and creative resources to generate an ad that is likely to convert prospects into customers? In 2021, the average cost-per-click for Facebook ads (in most industries) was between $0.50 and $2.00. Would a Carousel Ad be a good fit for your marketing strategy? If yes, why? Have you identified your target audience and the problem(s) they are trying to solve? Do you have quality images and/or videos of your products or services? “Carousel Ads give advertisers more flexibility to showcase their products than a single image or video ad. Advertisers can include reviews with related products, giving the user a better understanding before clicking.For B2C advertisers, it’s extremely important to get in front of users at the right time with the right products.

However, there are a few cases where a Carousel Ad might be a waste of resources. Here are some things to consider before you buy ad space: Do you need to pay more for additional ad space if you can use a compelling single-image ad to successfully attract customers? Have you identified your target audience and/or their concerns? Is your business’s Facebook page fully built and optimized? If your business page doesn’t have the information they need, Visitors from a Carousel Ad might click away and go elsewhere to spend their money. Do you have someone to manage the comments your business might get on the ad? Make Your Message Clear One of the few downsides to Facebook Carousel Ads is the potential to accidentally create a murky or confusing message. With so many ad slides at your disposal, it’s possible to unintentionally alienate users through confusing visuals or convoluted text. If you’re not sure whether your Carousel Ad is ready for prime time, we’ve included a few example ads just a bit further down the page that will give you a sense of what clear ad messaging looks like. Lean on Visual Space to Demonstrate Your ProductCarousel Ads are limited to 125 characters for text and 20 characters for link descriptions. If your product or service requires a lot of instructions, you may want to use multiple image slides to visually demonstrate the product. You could also create a video demonstration of your product. Use High Definition Video There’s nothing less visually appealing than a grainy video. Carousel Ads are designed to capture users’ attention quickly and keep them engaged with your content. For that reason, you should aim to post high-definition videos.Feature Best-Selling Products FirstIt might seem obvious, but you’ll want to make sure your top-performing products first. If there’s even a small chance that your audience won’t scroll past your first two ad slides, you’ll want to move your show-stopping slides to the front of the ad. Engage With Your AudienceFacebook Carousel Ads give users the ability to comment and react directly to the ad. This can be a great place to answer product-related questions, address concerns, and share general information about your business. With Carousel Ads, you have the opportunity to reach an individual right at the beginning of their purchasing journey. If you plan on using multiple Carousel Ads, it can be a good idea to assign your social media manager, online reputation manager, or other staff member to address these ad comments in a timely fashion.
