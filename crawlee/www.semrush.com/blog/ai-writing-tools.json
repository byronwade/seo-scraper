The Blog Post workflow is one of Jasper's most popular features. We tested its ability to produce human-like content by asking it to write a blog post on ‚ÄòHow to decorate a room like an interior designer.‚Äô First, you‚Äôll need to input lots of details to generate your article.For example, the tool asks you to specify the target audience, the outline, and the target keywords. You can use its AI suggestions, although they‚Äôre not based on real-time data.Jasper AI generated a decent piece of content with many bullet points. While it was not optimized for search intent, it could still be useful as a starting point.However, the blog post wasn‚Äôt in-depth and looked more like an outline. The tone of voice was rather neutral‚Äîeven somewhat robotic.Pros and Cons üî• Pros ü§î Cons Quickly generates different types of content for various channels (from social media posts to product descriptions) Offers the Jasper Brand Voice feature Generates AI images (with a separate tool) Limited capabilities for SEO optimization and long-form content No AI image generation directly in the content editor Might not be suitable for small teams and beginners without deep SEO and content marketing expertise Pricing Jasper ‚ÄúCreator‚Äù costs $49/month (one seat).

For the Business plan pricing, you‚Äôll need to contact the sales department.Final Verdict: Is Jasper AI Worth the Hype?Jasper's output for long-form content is not perfect and not optimized for SEO. However, it‚Äôs an awesome tool for creating content outlines and generating short-form copy at scale.3. Copy.ai: AI Content Tool for Marketing and Sales AutomationCopy.ai shares several similarities with Jasper. They both offer content creation features, cater to the enterprise audience, and are powered by AI. However, Copy.ai is designed to work with various AI models like GPT 3.5, GPT 4, Azure, and Anthropic, which makes it more flexible for delivering high-quality results. And, the tool‚Äôs main use case is automating various marketing and sales workflows. This makes it somewhat different from the rest of this list, but it might come in handy if you‚Äôre part of a large marketing or sales team.Key Features Over 100+ copywriting templates and tools An AI-powered language translator which supports 25+ languages A robust AI marketing and sales automation platform Tools to design your own workflows and complete tasks fasterCopy.ai User Experience Copy.ai offers a 14-day trial to test its features.

The Pro plan costs $36/month, and the Team plan comes at $186/month.Final Verdict: Is CopyAI Worth the Hype?Copy.ai can do wonders for large teams looking to create complex workflows and generate AI content at scale. However, it‚Äôs not optimized for SEO-friendly content creation and might come off as too complicated for beginners and smaller teams.4. Anyword: AI Writing Platform for Enterprise Marketing TeamsAnyword is another data-driven AI tool designed for enterprise marketing teams.Its superpower is using data to help teams understand their audience and create content that resonates more.Like Copy.ai, Anyword offers a variety of templates to generate marketing content. But it has several advanced features, such as predictive scores to identify the most effective copy. This tool can be especially useful for marketers who need to launch complex ad campaigns and optimize multi-channel content performance. Key Features Predictive performance scoring to evaluate copy effectiveness Versatile copywriting capabilities for emails, ads, websites, and more Customization options to align with brand voice and audience preferencesAnyword User Experience Anyword is quite easy to use and it won‚Äôt take you long to understand the interface and its features. You can specify the copywriting formula and the target audience. We tested Anyword‚Äôs capability by prompting it to generate Instagram caption copy to promote a webinar for a wellness company. Here are the results: The tool quickly generated multiple ads with different targeting options in minutes. Another feature we tested was the Blog Wizard, which was also easy to use. It generates articles based on the keyword, topic, and description you provide.We got a detailed outline with short paragraphs for each section. However, the tone of voice turned out quite robotic and the piece was fragmented, without content scoring or SEO optimization.Overall, the tool looks like a great option for creating short-form marketing copy and launching campaigns. However, its long-form content leaves much to be desired.Pros and Cons üî• Pros ü§î Cons AI and data analytics integrations for smarter copywriting decisions Helps to improve content engagement and conversion rates across your campaigns Generates various types of marketing copy Might have a bit of a learning curve to fully leverage predictive scoring Might not be ideal for small teams and individual creators because of its complexity Doesn‚Äôt offer its own SEO data to optimize your content for search PricingThe Starter plan with one seat costs $49/month. The Data-Driven plan costs $99/month/seat, and the Business plan costs $499/month.Final Verdict: Is Anyword Worth the Hype?Anyword is a quality tool for marketing and ad campaigns. However, right now it‚Äôs not well adapted for long-form content creation.5.

The AI writer was also a little slow to load and lagged as we interacted with the interface.The tool created a blog post and added an AI-generated cover image.The image was generic and looked like one of those corporate stock photos‚Äîalthough creating visuals for B2B topics can often be challenging.The overall output was also a bit generic and not very in-depth. Some important sections were missing and the existing ones looked more like an outline.The tool attributed the piece a content score of 67. However, it was quite fragmented, needed more details, and didn‚Äôt tackle many target keywords.Nevertheless, the ‚ÄúCompetitor Keywords‚Äù feature is helpful for ensuring that you have added all target phrases in your copy.Pros and Cons üî• Pros ü§î Cons Supports a wide range of content types Helps create SEO-friendly content in a consistent tone of voice Offers additional tools such as Chatsonic, Audiosonic, etc. The tool‚Äôs functionality and pricing can seem complicated It requires a more comprehensive content creation workflow You might still need additional SEO tools like Semrush‚Äôs Keyword Magic Tool to create organic content Pricing You can test Writesonic with the freemium option or sign up for ‚ÄúSmall Team‚Äù (a team of one) for $19/month. A monthly Writesonic subscription for a larger team is $500+ a month. Writesonic also offers different pricing options for its Botsonic tool.Final Verdict: Is Writesonic Worth the Hype?Writesonlc seems promising in terms of its features for assembling blog posts and integrations for SEO analysis.
