Choose the Right TopicYour infographic should be relevant and valuable to your target audience (the people your content is for).It should: Answer questions Solve problems Offer new insightsAsk yourself these questions to achieve that: Who is your audience? What kind of information would be helpful to them? What problems can you help them solve with an infographic?You can leverage Semrush’s Topic Research tool to brainstorm ideas and find relevant topics that are worth covering in the form of infographics.Here’s how to do that:Let’s say you’re in the health and fitness niche.And you want to create something around nutrition.First, enter your main theme, such as “nutrition,” in the search bar. You can also specify your target location if your content is for a specific geographic audience.Then, click the “Get content ideas” button:The tool will generate subtopics related to your main theme.In our case, the main theme was “nutrition.” So, we see subtopics like “healthy food,” “nutritional facts,” etc.:Click on each subtopic to see popular questions people ask about that specific topic:These questions can inspire infographic content that addresses your audience’s queries.2. Conduct Comprehensive ResearchConduct comprehensive research to get a deeper understanding of your topic.That’s a crucial step in crafting an effective infographic. Because it ensures that your content is accurate, relevant, and valuable to your target audience.Here’s how you can use the Keyword Magic Tool for your research:Let’s take our nutrition example.First, type “nutrition” into the search bar and click “Search.”The tool will generate a list of ideas you can explore in your infographic:You can further use the filters to refine your search and generate even more focused keyword ideas. For example, if you click on “Questions”:This will generate questions people ask about nutrition.You demonstrate your expertise and understanding of the industry by directly addressing common queries or concerns.This can position you as a go-to resource for valuable, accurate information. And also foster a sense of reliability and credibility with your audience.Next, you can also use “Intent” to filter the results. So you can quickly find keywords related to your informational needs.In our case, if we want to curate an infographic about nutritional facts, we’d click on “Informational” in the “Intent” section:After analyzing related keywords, questions people ask, and the intent behind them, you’ll end up with phrases like: “What is nutrition,” “Why is nutrition important,” and “Watermelon nutrition facts.”And your nutritional facts infographic could have the following information on it: What is nutrition Why is nutrition important Nutritional facts about watermelon, bananas, avocados, etc.3. Pick the Right Type of Infographic DesignAfter you’ve gathered insights for your infographic, it’s time to choose the type of infographic you’ll use.Base your decision on the nature of the information you’ll be sharing in your infographic.For example:If the information is primarily statistics, then consider using statistical infographics. If you’re trying to convey a particular process, use process infographics.Once you’ve decided on the type of infographic, start organizing your information so it flows logically.You can use many of the following elements to organize your information in an infographic: Lists Tables Charts Graphs Diagrams Timelines PictogramsThis is how an infographic looks after all the information is organized:4. Understand Visual HierarchyVisual hierarchy is a design principle that helps you arrange elements in a way that draws the viewer’s attention to the most important information first.Here are five ways to use visual hierarchy effectively in your infographic design: Size: One of the simplest ways to establish a visual hierarchy is through size. Larger elements naturally draw more attention and appear more important. Use this to your advantage by making key points or critical data bigger in your infographic. Color: You can also use colors to establish hierarchy. Bright or contrasting colors stand out. Muted tones blend into the background. Use bold colors for important info and lighter shades for secondary details. Positioning: People notice elements at the top of a page or along the natural reading path first. So, place key information along these paths. This ensures it receives the attention it deserves. Typography: Different fonts and text styles can also create a sense of hierarchy. Bold, large, or unique typefaces stand out and show importance. Smaller fonts work well for less essential details or supporting information. Whitespace: Whitespace (empty space) can separate and highlight important elements. Provide breathing room around critical points. This makes them stand out and keeps your infographic from appearing cluttered.5. Make Smart Color ChoicesColors evoke emotions and direct attention.That’s why you should select a color scheme that aligns with your brand and message.Here are three tips for effective color choices in your infographic design: Use the 60-30-10 rule. Choose three harmonizing colors in a ratio of approximately 60%-30%-10%. Your primary color should take up about 60% of the infographic. The secondary color about 30%. Apply the accent color to the remaining 10% of elements. Choose complementary colors. Choose a harmonious color palette. Choose colors that go well together for a harmonious design. Instead of using conflicting shades. Understand color psychology. Colors can stir emotions and ignite ideas. Blue symbolizes trustworthiness and stability. Yellow represents optimism and energy. Think about the message you want to convey when selecting infographic colors.6. Pay Attention to TypographyFonts play a crucial role in readability and mood.Here are some typography tips to consider: Keep it simple. Choose an easy-to-read font. Sans serif styles like Arial and Helvetica are perfect for infographics. Because they’re clear and versatile. Mix fonts carefully. To include multiple fonts, choose two complementary ones. Use one font for headlines and another for body copy. Size matters. Pick a font size that is readable from a distance or on mobile devices. A recommended minimum font size is 16px. Limit text length. Keep the text concise and easy to read. Limit lines to six to eight words. Too much text can overwhelm your audience.7. Test and RefineFinally, always test your infographic. Testing and refining your infographic ensures it effectively communicates the intended message and resonates with the target audience.Here are three ways to do that: Invite a small group from your target audience to review the infographic. Consider their feedback and make any changes if needed. Test the design on various devices and browsers. Ensure everything functions as expected before publishing. After your infographic goes live, track its performance. Track page views, shares, and other key metrics to see how it resonates with your audience.Further reading: 7 Common Infographic Designs & Why We Use Them4 Ways Infographics Transform Content Marketing CampaignsEnhancing EngagementInfographics have the ability to draw the attention of readers, far more than plain text or even standard images.With a combination of relevant imagery, concise text, and organized data, they offer a quick snapshot of a topic.
