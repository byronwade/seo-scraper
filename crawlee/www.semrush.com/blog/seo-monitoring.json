Improving its content, visuals, or CTAs should keep your visitors engaged for longer.You can find your exit pages using Semrush’s Traffic Analytics Top Pages Report.Navigate to “Top Pages.”Scroll to find the “Exits” tab. Sort the page results by highest exit rate.Look for commonalities across the top exit pages. Is there a specific type of content that doesn’t retain visitors?

Direct user feedback can provide invaluable insights into why they’re leaving.Lastly, while high exit rates on certain pages might be concerning, it’s essential to contextualize the data. For instance, a high exit rate on a “Thank You” page after a successful purchase or signup is expected. Remember: Regularly monitor SEO and adapt your strategy based on this data so your website continually meets users’ needs and expectations. Conversion RateConversion rate is the percentage of visitors who come to your website and take a predetermined action. Like clicking a button, buying a product, or signing up for a newsletter.Not all conversions contribute to revenue directly (e.g., an ebook download or newsletter signup).
