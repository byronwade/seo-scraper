  "content": "What Is Mobile-First Indexing?Mobile-first indexing means Google’s web crawler prioritizes indexing the mobile version of a website’s content over its desktop counterpart. Which informs rankings. With Google’s original desktop-first indexing, their system would crawl pages from your site with the desktop and mobile user agent (crawlers). Then, it would get page information from the desktop page’s content.And show it in search results if the search engine thought the information was relevant to the user’s query. But with mobile-first indexing, the indexing system will look at the mobile page instead of the desktop page for information. What Does Mobile-First Indexing Mean for SEO?Mobile-first indexing has a significant impact on SEO. It affects how Google crawls, indexes, and (hopefully) ranks your site. Which means:If your site isn’t optimized for a stellar mobile user experience, it could negatively affect how it performs in search results. Or even prevent it from appearing in results.To check your site’s mobile-friendliness, run a quick audit. Sign up for a free Semrush account and open Site Audit—it’ll crawl your site with a mobile bot, just like Google. In the settings, double-check that the crawler is set to “SiteAuditBot-Mobile.” And, click “Start Site Audit.”You’ll see a dashboard showing your site’s SEO health.Like this:Head to the “Issues” tab, and you’ll see the “Errors,” “Warnings,” and “Notices” holding your site back. And the number of affected pages. Mobile-First Indexing Best PracticesFollow these best practices to make sure your site is optimized for Google’s mobile-first indexing:Make Your Site Mobile-Friendly and ResponsiveA responsive web design automatically adapts to multiple screen sizes, orientations, and devices. It rearranges elements, adjusts font sizes, and hides unnecessary content. Making your site look great and work well on any device. That’s key for user experience. And mobile-friendliness. Here’s what responsive design looks like on a real page:So, instead of having multiple URLs (one for mobile and one for desktop), pick a theme for your site that’s responsive. As you browse themes for your site, check if it’s responsive by seeing the demo page. Most website builders have this option.Alternatively, you could try shrinking your browser window. To see if everything resizes appropriately. You can also use your phone or tablet to visit the page. Can you explore the site easily? Note: If the theme you’re currently using isn’t mobile-friendly, you might need to find a new mobile-friendly theme for your site.

It measures how real-world users perceive the quality of your webpages. And looks at factors like loading speed, visual stability, and interactivity (also called the Core Web Vitals). But providing a good page experience also depends on other signals like ensuring mobile-friendliness, using secure HTTPS pages, and avoiding intrusive pop-ups or banners. These signals have been part of Google’s ranking algorithm for a while, but they’re now more important than ever.Which means:Your site needs to be easy to use on mobile devices. With readable text, clickable buttons, and no unplayable content.Both page experience and mobile-first indexing focus on improving the user experience on mobile devices. Each requires you to pay attention to your site’s performance and usability on mobile devices. And both can affect your rankings and traffic.
