Many users have already discovered the value of our tool for six different networks: Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest LinkedIn Google My BusinessSemrush Social consists of tools and reports for social publishing, social monitoring, social benchmarking, and social analytics. All the tools and reports are linked, giving you full access to all the data and resources needed to create and manage a strong social media presence.Below we’ll outline how you can use Semrush Social, along with its unique features, for each platform. The tool functions similarly for each platform but with some nuances that we’ll discuss below. First, let’s take a deep dive into how to use Semrush Social for Facebook. Semrush Social for Facebook Facebook is not new, but it’s still an essential social media platform for marketing your business. Let’s take a look at how Semrush can help you grow and refine your Facebook presence. Social Media Editorial Calendar Our social content calendar is the first thing you’ll see in the Social Poster tool. The calendar has options for monthly and weekly views, making it easy to visualize your social content for each platform.From this screen, just click on New post to begin creating content.Curate Industry-Relevant News On the same screen as your editorial calendar, click on Content ideas to set up an RSS feed. This will help you stay on top of industry news and use your social accounts to show that you are doing so. Our RSS feed feature automatically curates content from your chosen thought leaders and lets us instantly create content to share with your audience. Scheduling and Publication Options for FacebookIn the New post screen, the Social Poster tool gives you several options for scheduling your posts for each platform, including Facebook. You’re able to: Write posts Add photos, videos, gifs, and emojis Save your draft to revisit or approve later Schedule it to post automatically on a specific date and time Add your new post to your queue to post automatically and fill empty slots in your posting schedule Post the same content regularly on a predetermined scheduleCreate DraftsJot down content ideas or even full-fledged posts you want to circle back to. Save your content in drafts to edit and publish later. This is an excellent asset for team collaboration, as it allows multiple team members to review a post before it is scheduled.Post Preview See how your post will appear on both desktop and mobile before it goes live so you can make sure everything looks great.Image Editing OptionsSocial Media Poster has a built-in image editor that contains filters, stickers, drawing tools, and more to keep your posts engaging. Hover over the image and click the pencil icon to quickly add the image effects of your choice or adjust the size. You can also create a Facebook profile pic, cover photo, or post image.While this feature is available for all platforms, the ability to create profile pictures and cover photos is exclusive to Facebook.Read more here about creating attractive, high-quality images that will appeal to multiple audiences with the Image Editor.Add VideosSemrush Social allows you to upload any video in an MP4 or MOV format of up to 100 megabytes. Add your post to the queue—post it now, schedule it for later, or save it as a draft.Short, Trackable UTMsFrom the New post screen in Social Poster, you can also set UTM parameters. UTMs help you better track where your online traffic is coming from, and knowing that they came to you from social media is a huge advantage. Our UTM builder and link shortener allow you to create short, likely-to-be-clicked, highly trackable links.Add TagsYou now have the opportunity to create custom tags to categorize your posts. For example, you can add tags like “Memes,” “Discounts,” and “Promo” to tailor your approach to different content types. These tags are invisible to your customers but provide you with valuable data on the most impactful content types or campaigns on Facebook. You can easily filter this data in your admin panel within Social Poster.Suggested Time for Scheduled PostsFrom the New post screen, you can schedule your content for publication. You will also see insights into when your fans are most active online right on the screen, so you can schedule at the time with the most possible traffic.Analyze Your Facebook PerformanceIn the Social Analytics tool, you’ll discover valuable insights, including information about your posts’ performance, audience, brand mentions, page likes, and engagement. This tool is available for Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, but let’s continue our deep dive into Facebook.Facebook AudienceSelect the Facebook option in the Social Analytics tool, then click on the Audience to see information about your Facebook audience. First you’ll see helpful statistics about your core audience, such as your largest country, gender, age group, and what time of day they’re most likely to be active on the platform.Then you’ll see a further breakdown of location, age, and gender.Page LikesUnder the Page likes tab, you will see your total number of page likes, both from organic and paid search, and how this number compares with the previous month.Social EngagementThe Engagement report shows how much engagement your posts have received over the selected period:If you notice a spike or dip in likes or engagement on a particular day, click on the red icon at the bottom of the report to see what exactly you posted on that day. Insights on Your Published PostsFinally, visit the Posts tab to analyze each post in more detail. Depending on your goals and metrics, you can analyze posts in terms of their engagement, impressions and reach, clicks, and negative actions.Social Inbox for FacebookNext, let’s talk about Social Inbox. Use this tool to reply to comments, mentions, and private messages for Facebook.Brand MentionsScroll carefully through the Mentions report to keep track of what people are saying about your brand, who mentioned it, and what kind of reactions this mention has received:Track Your Facebook Competitors with Social TrackerWith the Social Tracker tool, you can compare your performance against that of your competition. Compare their growth and engagement levels to yours and identify the top-performing content in your niche. For example, in the Overview tab, scroll down to the Comparison With Competitors chart. The Audience tab shows you your number of followers on each platform compared to your competitors.For each platform, and Facebook specifically, scroll back up to the Posts tab to see how specific posts performed. You can even search based on the hashtags, photo, video, or text-only content within them.

If you want them to stand out from the pack, then making the perfect enhancements is crucial.

Check out the Where are my followers? graph to see how far your reach really extends—and potentially find new audiences you didn’t know you had.You can also evaluate your current followers, looking at demographic information like their Company Size, Industry, and Job Function. Monitoring Your Competitors on LinkedInCheck our Social Tracker to assess your competitors’ follower counts and compare them to yours. Start by identifying your top competitors, looking at both their total followers and their recent growth rate. Don’t count out newer accounts with slightly smaller follower counts if they also have more aggressive growth rates. You can also spot significant gains (or losses) in their follower count, and see when they happened.Identify Top-Performing LinkedIn ContentOur Social Content Insights tool also lets you get an overview of your LinkedIn posts’ engagement metrics. Using this tool, you can understand key statistics about your LinkedIn performance all on a single dashboard.Social Content Insights can beconnected with your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest accounts to identify what content drives more engagement among your audience.

In fact, Pinterest recommends that you start saving seasonal content 30-45 days in advance to ensure that you get the maximum traffic. And you can still queue content or post immediately for those bursts of spontaneous inspiration.Add URLs to Pins A designated area in our scheduler for pins allows you to place the link you want to send users to.This option will create a rich pin that users can click to access your site, instead of just featuring the URL in the pin’s description. If you don’t want a pin to take users to a landing page, you can skip out on the URL altogether.Because Pinterest doesn’t like to see shortened links, you won’t see a link shortener for this platform. You can still do this manually off-platform, but it is best to use the full URL here in most cases.Image EditorText overlay is copy that you can apply directly to your pins, adding valuable context and telling users why they should click while helping it to stand out. Our built-in image editor will not only allow you to adjust brightness and saturation to help your pin pop but will also add that text overlay.Semrush Social for Google My BusinessGoogle My Business posts are a great way to improve your customer experience with timely information about your business. Not only does it aid your visibility and help to boost traffic to your website, but it also helps your customers make better decisions as they browse.Post and Schedule on Google My BusinessStart by choosing the locations you want to post to and connect them in Social Poster.
