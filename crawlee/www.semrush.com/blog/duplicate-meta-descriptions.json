  "content": "What Is a Duplicate Meta Description?Duplicate meta descriptions are meta descriptions that are the same for two or more pages on your website.A meta description is an HTML tag that holds a short summary of a webpage’s content. Search engines like Google often use them to generate descriptive snippets in search results.Let’s see what duplicate meta descriptions look like in practice.This is an example of two pages on a single website having the same meta description.But why are duplicate meta descriptions an issue?Here’s Why Duplicate Meta Descriptions Are ProblematicDuplicate meta descriptions can have a negative impact on the user experience and click-through rates from search engine results.When two or more pages have the same meta descriptions, users may not be able to figure out what kind of content they can expect on each page.That can cause confusion among your potential website visitors and cause them to seek answers elsewhere—possibly on your competitors’ websites that are ranking on the same search engine results pages (SERPs).That can lead to a lower click-through rate, a dip in organic traffic, and potentially harm to your brand’s reputation.How to Fix Duplicate Meta Descriptions in 4 StepsLet’s explore how to easily find and fix duplicate meta descriptions in four steps.1. Find Pages With Duplicate Meta Descriptions You can easily find pages with duplicate meta descriptions with Semrush’s Site Audit tool.Let’s see how it works.Go to Site Audit.If you’ve never used the tool before, have a look at these configuration instructions to set up your first project.Once your audit is complete, go back to Site Audit.Click on the “Issues” tab.You’ll see a list of all issues, warnings, and notices your website has.Type “duplicate meta descriptions” in the search bar.Click on the “# pages” to see a list of pages affected by this issue.You’ll see a list of all pages that have duplicate meta descriptions.By clicking on the “# pages” next to each URL, you’ll see which other URLs have the same meta description as the one in the list.Pro tipSet up daily or weekly automatic Site Audit re-crawls so you’ll be informed of duplicate meta descriptions and more than 140 other issues via email.2. Prioritize the Key PagesIf your website has a lot of duplicate meta description issues, it’s best to fix the key issues first.The key pages to fix are those that have: High business importance: For example, sales landing pages with high conversion rates and/or pages that recently experienced a drop in traffic High search traffic potential: For example, pages intended to target keywords with high search volume that are seeing lots of impressions but relatively few clicks in search enginesLet’s see how you can find pages with high organic impressions and few clicks.Go to Google Search Console.Click “Full report” in the “Performance” section.Click “Total clicks” > “Total impressions” > “Average CTR” to examine all three metrics at once.Scroll down to the list and click “Pages.”Double-click “CTR” to see low-performing pages.On top of the list, you’ll see pages with the lowest CTR and high number of impressions.These pages are showing up in search results often. But users are choosing not to click on them.By improving meta descriptions on these pages, you may be able to increase the click-through rate and organic traffic.3. Create Unique, Descriptive Meta DescriptionsFor each page you selected, write a unique meta description.Let’s have a look at some of the best practices when it comes to meta descriptions: Include the primary target keyword. By doing that, you’ll let the reader and search engines know what to expect on your page. Answer the search intent. Reassure users they’ll find what they’re looking for on your page. For example, if someone is looking for “how to style crocs,” you can start your meta description with “learn how to style crocs…” Make sure it aligns with the content on the page. If something’s not on the page, don’t mention it in the meta description, as that will lead to disappointment and higher bounce rates. Keep it short. A meta description of 105 characters (680 pixels) will be visible on both desktop and mobile. Start with the key information: This ensures that the keywords appear even if a portion of the meta description gets cut off by Google.Use meta description checker tools (like To The Web’s) to see what it’ll look like if it appears in the SERPs.NoteKeep in mind that this preview won’t always be 100% reliable.Further reading: How Not to Write a Meta Description4.
