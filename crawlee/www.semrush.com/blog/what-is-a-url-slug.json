But he also emphasized that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúvery very lightweight‚Äù one, and it primarily helps to assess the page before Google accesses it.In one of his tweets, Mueller said:In other words:Even if having keywords in the URL is a ranking factor, we shouldn‚Äôt overestimate its effect on rankings.However, it might still make sense to use the target keyword of a page in a URL slug. Especially considering the user experience (UX) point of view, which is closely connected to SEO.Let's take a look at these two examples: https://website.com/blog/rock-climbing https://website.com/blog/82354While the first example provides clear information about the content of the post, the second is just a chain of numbers that doesn't provide any added value. If someone only saw these two URL addresses, they'd be more likely to click the first one. Regardless of the actual content on either page.That's why a URL slug should provide a concise description of a page.URL Slug Best PracticesLet's take a look at some best practices and tips on how to create good URL slugs.Be DescriptiveAs we've already mentioned, the primary role of URL slugs is to make URLs more user-friendly. Therefore, they should describe the content of a page. Good URL slug: /best-air-purifier Bad URL slug: /2575Using the target keyword is a great way to achieve this. Why? Because it‚Äôs usually an accurate, yet very short, description of what the page is about. Make It Concise and Easy to ReadA good URL slug shouldn't be too long. Long URLs are harder to read and remember. Try to use fewer than five words in your slug. Good URL slug: /abs-exercises Bad URL slug: /the-best-abs-exercises-for-all-levels-of-gym-goerAlso, a URL that‚Äôs too long will get truncated in Google‚Äôs search results. While this is not an SEO disaster, it doesn't make the page snippet look very good.Include Your Target KeywordIncluding your target keyword in the URL slug will make it easier for both search engines and users to understand that your page is relevant to a particular search query.Here‚Äôs an example of a good and bad URL slug for a page targeting the keyword ‚Äúkeyword research.‚Äù Good URL slug: /keyword-research Bad URL slug: /10-tips-for-researching-keywordsSeparate WordsHow you separate the words (or not) influences the readability of a URL slug. Separating the words in the slug helps users understand the URL more easily. Good URL slug: /best-travel-tips Bad URL slug: /besttraveltipsUse Hyphens, Not UnderscoresThe best practice is to use hyphens to separate words in URLs. Search engines may not correctly interpret other separators (like underscores). Good URL slug: /good-old-fashioned-pancakes Bad URL slug: /good_old_fashioned_pancakesUse Lowercase CharactersSince URLs are case-sensitive, it‚Äôs best to stick to lowercase characters to avoid mistyped URLs.Lowercase URLs are also easier to type manually. Good URL slug: /new-york Bad URL slug: /New-YorkAvoid Special CharactersGoogle Search Central recommends avoiding non-ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) characters, such as special characters of some languages or emojis.Here‚Äôs an example for a hypothetical page in German: Good URL slug: /kaiserstrasse Bad URL slug: /kaiserstra√üeAnd one using emojis: Good URL slug: /emoji-meanings Bad URL slug: /üòäüöÄMake It Future-ProofIt‚Äôs best to avoid numbers in URLs that are likely to be changed in the future, like a number of tips or ideas or the publishing year.
