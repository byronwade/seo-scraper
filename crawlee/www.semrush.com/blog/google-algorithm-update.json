These updates are designed to improve the quality of search results for users.For example, an update might seek to promote sites with helpful content. Or penalize pages with slow load times.Google confirms the most important ranking updates through its Search Status Dashboard:But Google makes smaller updates every day.See how much search results are changing in your country and category with the Semrush Sensor:And monitor your keyword rankings with the Position Tracking tool:That way, you can stay on top of Google updates. And adapt your search engine optimization (SEO) strategy.How Can You Recover from Google Algorithm Updates? If your organic traffic is suffering because of a Google algorithm update, it’s important to understand what changes Google made. Look at any Google guidance, as well as industry commentary.Conduct an SEO competitor analysis on rival sites, too. To see whether they experienced a similar decline in performance. Or to identify factors that contributed to their success.You can then take corrective action and, if necessary, adjust your SEO strategy. But don’t fall into the trap of taking action too soon. Or making changes based on gut instinct, rather than hard evidence. Otherwise, you can do more harm than good.Also, bear in mind that it takes time to recover your rankings—even if you take all the right steps. You might even have to wait for the next algorithm update.2024 Updates Here’s a quick overview of the latest Google algorithm updates.August 2024 Core UpdateThe August 2024 core update was designed to improve the quality of content found in search results.

And demote unsatisfactory content.If your site is negatively affected by a core update, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve violated any Google guidelines. It could just mean that your competitors have beaten you. Google advises against trying to “fix” anything if a core update has affected your site.

While some sites got less holiday traffic than expected, others benefited from higher rankings.For example, eBay gained 44 positions after the first day of the update.Announced: December 3, 2020Started: December 3, 2020Completed: December 16, 2020Duration: 13 daysMay 2020 Core UpdateGoogle released the May 2020 core update shortly after the COVID-19 outbreak. Many commenters believed this algorithm update tackled health misinformation in the SERPs.Health is a YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) topic.

This blog post advises site owners to self-assess their content using the Search Quality Rater Guidelines.Announced: January 13, 2020Started: January 13, 2020Completed: January 16, 2020Duration: Three daysPre-2020 Major UpdatesThese are the most important Google algorithm updates announced before 2020: BERT Update, October 2019: BERT is a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm that helps Google understand the nuances of users’ search queries. And therefore deliver more relevant results. For example, Google could better understand the difference between “brazil to usa” and “usa to brazil.” Medic Update, August 2018: The August 2018 core update was colloquially known as the Medic update because it seemed to target medical sites. Particularly those that didn’t comply with Google’s E-A-T (now E-E-A-T) guidelines. For example, sites making medical claims without substantiating them. RankBrain Update, October 2015: RankBrain was Google’s first AI system and deep learning model. It helps Google identify related words and concepts. Google began using RankBrain in April 2015 to better understand new queries (which accounted for around 15% of searches). Mobilegeddon, February 2015: The Mobile-Friendly Update, more commonly known as “mobilegeddon,” boosted the rankings of mobile-friendly pages in mobile search results. This meant that mobile SEO became extremely important. Hummingbird Update, September 2013: With the Hummingbird update, Google moved away from matching all words in a query to words on a page. It began to ignore words that weren’t hugely relevant to the searcher’s meaning. This meant Google could better deal with natural language (conversational) queries. Penguin Update, April 2012: Penguin penalized sites engaging in webspam tactics—i.e., sites attempting to manipulate search rankings with SEO tactics that violate Google’s guidelines. It made it harder to influence rankings through keyword stuffing and link schemes. Panda Update, February 2011: The Google Panda algorithm update was designed to reduce rankings for low-quality sites (with unoriginal, unhelpful content). And improve rankings for high-quality sites (with useful, original content). Caffeine Update, August 2009: The Caffeine update made Google quicker at discovering and indexing new content. So searchers could find the latest information more quickly. The update was a change to Google’s indexing system rather than its ranking algorithm.Prepare for the Next Google UpdateTo prepare for the next Google algorithm update, audit your site and look for opportunities to improve.
