  "content": "Definition of Visual SearchA visual search is a search method where a person uses an image—like a photo or drawing—to look for information on search engines.Let’s say you come across an image of an unfamiliar animal. By uploading the image to a visual search engine, you can learn the animal’s name. And habitat.And get more images of the same animal.How Visual Search Differs from Image SearchWhile visual and image searches both produce image results, they have key differences.Search Query FormatVisual search queries are in image format.For example, say you want to use a visual search engine to get more information about a flower in your yard. You’ll need to provide the search engine with a picture of the flower. Image search queries are in text format.To get more information about a particular flower using an image search, you’ll need to type the flower’s name into the search engine. Or a description of the flower.Use CasesVisual search is helpful when: You’re unsure of the object’s name. Visual search engines can analyze the image to identify the object. And provide you with information. You’re looking for similar objects. Visual search engines excel at displaying images similar to the one you’ve shared.Image search is helpful when: You don’t have a reference image. In this case, use text to describe what you’re looking for. You’re looking for images with certain characteristics. Use descriptive text queries to narrow your search.Further reading: 21 Best Search Engines in the WorldHow Visual Search WorksVisual search works by having a visual search engine recognize an image and compare it against other images in its database.The visual search engine then shortlists images, ranks them based on relevance, and displays them to the user. It may also provide related information. Like the names, locations, and prices of objects in the images.In the process, the visual search engine may use one or both of these techniques: Search by example: The visual search engine looks for images relevant to the source image. In terms of shared identifiers like shape and color. Search by metadata: The visual search engine looks for images with metadata relevant to the source image. This metadata includes an image’s filename and alternative (alt) text.For example, when you search for a product image of a sandal with Google Lens, a visual search engine, you get these results: Google Lens shows where to find this sandal online. And others like it. It also tells you how much each one costs for easy price comparison. The Role of AI in Visual SearchVisual search involves various fields of artificial intelligence (AI). So the visual search engine can understand an image’s contents. And identify other relevant images. Just like a human can.These AI fields include: Computer vision: Helps the visual search engine “see.” And recognize images. Machine learning: The visual search engine “learns” concepts by analyzing sample images containing these concepts in a database. By doing so, it can identify whether other images contain—or don’t contain—these concepts.Let’s say you give a visual search engine hundreds of pictures of cars of different makes, models, and colors.The visual search engine uses computer vision to “see” the cars in these pictures. And as it analyzes them, it “learns” what a car looks like.As a result, when you share a new picture of a car that isn’t in the visual search engine’s database, it can correctly identify the picture as a car. Even if it has never “seen” this picture before.Pro tipArtificial intelligence can also help you improve your writing. Try the SEO Writing Assistant. This AI-powered tool can evaluate your writing’s readability, rephrase text, and provide keyword suggestions.6 Visual Search Engines and ToolsVarious brands have added visual search engines and tools to their platforms.Here are six of these tools.

This is helpful if you want to: Ask the website owner to credit you for the image. And give you a backlink. Take legal action against websites that have used your images without permissionTo do a visual search of your images, use a visual search engine like Google Lens or Bing Visual Search.For this example, we used Bing Visual Search. And selected “Pages with this image.” To get a list of pages with highly similar images. Or identical images to the one we uploaded. Go through the list of pages. And decide on your next steps. For example, ask for image credit and a backlink. Or reach out about potential copyright infringement.Repeat this process for each image you want to search.Enhance the User ExperienceVisual search provides a more intuitive and convenient way for users to find what they're looking for online. Instead of typing in search queries, users can simply upload an image. To find similar products or information.Increase Brand AwarenessVisual search tools provide a unique opportunity to reach new audiences. For example, if someone comes across one of your products and wants to learn more, they can take a photo. And run a visual search.This will pull up relevant pages about your product. Making it a convenient way for the person to learn about your brand. Close More SalesVisual search makes it convenient for users to buy your products.After uploading an image, visual search engines list the sites selling that item. Or similar items. They also display pricing. For easy comparison shopping.How to Optimize Your Images for Visual SearchOptimizing images for visual search can help you rank higher for relevant search queries. Produce High-Quality ImagesVisual search engines have an easier time understanding—and ranking—high-quality images. Follow these best practices: Ensure the image’s object(s) are in focus. Visual search engines may have trouble recognizing blurry objects. Photograph your objects in a sufficiently bright environment. The image should be bright enough for visual search engines to recognize the objects in it. Make the main object the focus of your images. Prominently display the main object in the center of the image.Optimize Image File SizesKeep your images’ file sizes as small as possible. This helps your pages load faster. And potentially rank higher than slower pages with equally relevant content.To reduce your images’ file sizes, follow these tips: Use the appropriate file format. For example, saving your photo in JPG file format can help significantly reduce its file size without too much quality loss. Use the appropriate image dimensions. Images with larger dimensions tend to have larger file sizes. Produce your images in their required dimensions. Don’t upload an overly large image and shrink it on the page later. Compress images. Tools like Compressor.io and Optimizilla can help you reduce your images’ file sizes. Before you add them to your webpages.Test Your Images’ RecognizabilityUse visual search tools like Google Cloud’s Vision AI. To check whether visual search engines can recognize your images.Scroll down to the “Demo” section. Drag your image file to the upload box or click the upload box. To select your image file from your computer’s file directory.Vision AI will analyze the image and display tabs with various details: Objects: A list of objects Vision AI has detected in the image. And a confidence score out of 100% for each object. A higher score indicates the tool’s increased certainty it has identified the object correctly. Labels: For object characteristics like items, locations, and animal species Text: Any text Vision AI has detected in the image Properties: These include the image’s dominant colors and crop hints—i.e., suggested aspect ratios for cropping the image Safe Search: How likely your image is to trigger Google’s SafeSearch filters for adult, violent, or other potentially sensitive contentToggle between each tab to access the information.If Vision AI has identified your image’s objects inaccurately, reported low confidence scores, or displayed other unexpected results, try to diagnose the cause of the issue.Adjust your image accordingly. Then, test your image again.For example, if you think Vision AI has wrongly identified your photo’s objects because it’s too dark, retake the photo. And have Vision AI analyze your new photo. To see if it can correctly identify the objects this time.Use Descriptive File NamesUse a short description of your image as its file name. Search engines may consider it when trying to understand your image. And display and rank it for relevant visual search results.For instance, if your image is of the Golden Gate Bridge, its filename could be “golden-gate-bridge.jpg.”Avoid using generic filenames like “IMG_3410.jpg” and “image1.png.”Mark Up Images with Structured DataStructured data, or schema markup, is a type of code that tells search engines your content’s category type. Examples of categories are carousels, products, and recipes.Adding structured data to images and the pages they’re on helps them appear in the visual search results. For relevant categories of information.The structured data can also make your image’s search result more visually appealing. And informative. So that it attracts more clicks.For example, a page with product structured data can display special labels for a product’s price. And availability. Pro tipLearn more about schema markup and how it’s helpful for SEO in our guide: What Is Schema Markup and How to Implement ItAdd Image Alt TextAlt text is a descriptive attribute added to images on webpages. To provide information about the image’s contents. Alt text is visible if an image doesn’t display properly. Like this: Visual search engines can use alt text to understand an image’s contents better. When ranking it for search queries.Pro tipUse Semrush’s Site Audit tool to mass-check your website for missing alt text. Site Audit can also detect over 140 other technical issues, including broken links, slow pages, and 404 errors.Your image’s alt text should be descriptive. Just like its file name. But it can be longer to accommodate more details.For example, the alt text for the image below could be: “A white board with the quote ‘Coffee is the most important meal of the day’ in black letters.”Image Source: UnsplashFurther reading: Image SEO and Alt Tags: 10 Image Optimization TipsCreate an Image SitemapAn image sitemap is a set of code that tells search engines about your website’s images. Having a sitemap helps search engines discover your images. And rank them for visual search queries.Search engines recognize two forms of image sitemaps. The first form is a dedicated image sitemap separate from your main website sitemap.Alternatively, you can have a main sitemap that contains image sitemap tags. This is what The Guardian has done:Your website platform may offer options for automatically creating and managing either form of image sitemap.For example, if you run a Squarespace website, the platform will generate a main sitemap for it. Squarespace will automatically update the sitemap whenever you add new content. Including images. If you’ve built your website on WordPress, install a sitemap generator tool like Yoast SEO.Apply New Search Technology to Your BusinessUse the methods above to help your website rank higher for relevant visual searches. And capture more traffic. But visual search isn’t the only way for users to find your website.Help searchers discover your site using digital marketing tools.
