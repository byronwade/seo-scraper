saw mixed performance in September, with several major sectors experiencing fluctuations. Overall, most major platforms experienced month-over-month (MoM) declines, suggesting a slowdown in user engagement across a number of categories.Some of the biggest winners last month included instructure.com, which saw a significant traffic boom of more than 110%. In addition, espn.com saw an impressive 27% uptick, and chatgpt.com (22%) also saw traffic growth.There was much more action on the negative side last month, with sites like outbrain.com (-37.7%), accuweather.com (-21.7%), and roblox.com (-19.3%) struggling to maintain engagement. Rounding out the biggest September losers, quora.com saw a -16.8% traffic decline, and cragislist.org (-16.9%) didn’t fare much better.Major tech and social media platforms faced some of the biggest challenges. Industry-leader youtube.com, for instance, saw a -4.2% decrease in traffic, and facebook.com (-6.4%) saw traffic fall similarly. In addition, amazon.com saw a -5.5% decline, and both linkedin.com (-8.1%) and twitter.com (-8.8%) saw more serious declines.E-commerce sites also faced turbulence. Big players like walmart.com (-8%) experienced significant drops, despite sites like target.com (2%) posting modest gains. Traffic to apple.com managed to grow 2.7% as well, contrasting the trend with other major players.On the news front, sites like cnn.com (-6.6%) and nytimes.com (-5.8%) experienced substantial dips, while nbcnews.com (1.9%) saw gains. Despite continued election coverage, foxnews.com (-10.9%) struggled, while sites like bbc.com (2.3%) managed to find some traction. Overall, September was a challenging month for a number of sectors, with declines across tech, social media, and e-commerce. Although a few standout gains were seen in education and sports, most sites will need to regroup in October.It’s Not Just About the TrafficAlthough observing position changes through traffic volume can help to analyze global trends and benchmark your performance against the competition, Semrush’s Traffic Analytics reports also include important metrics to keep watch on:•Mobile vs. desktop traffic share shows which devices people use to enter a site page. When doing competitive benchmarking, this metric can help to determine whether you need to implement certain steps (e.g. ensure further mobile optimization or come up with additional desktop traffic generation tactics) to strengthen your traffic acquisition strategy and stay in the game.•Number of pages per visit, average visit duration, and bounce rate reflect the quality of site content. If you spot that your competitor’s website shows better performance, it's a sign that you have to work on your SEO and content strategy, comparing the structure, content, and design of your site pages against theirs.Explore traffic patterns in your industry with Open .TrendsGet insightsInsights on the Most Popular Sites in the US by IndustryTo spot more granular market patterns and provide more useful insights, we decided to show the leading U.S. websites in terms of traffic volume by different industries: Education, Fashion, Travel, Retail, Teamwork, Social Networks, Media, Food Delivery, and Streaming Services.EducationFashionTravelRetailTeamworkSocial NetworksMediaFood DeliveryStreaming ServicesEducationUnited States, September 2024The Most Visited Websites - US, Education CategorySeptember was an incredible month for the education sector, which saw a significant uptick in traffic across the board. Overall, top education sites were up 104.7% month-over-month (MoM), with all but one site seeing big-time growth.Leading the pack was goguardian.com, which saw traffic to its site explode by nearly 220%. Mheducation.com (120.6%) followed close behind, along with pearson.com (117.7%), and industry-leader instructure.com (112.7%). Cengage.com saw a 107.3% increase, followed by quizlet.com at 93.3%, chegg.com at 87.1%, and schoology.com at 84.5%.The sole loser last month was duolingo.com, which saw its traffic drop by nearly -6%. As more of a leisure learning platform, it makes sense to see traffic fall as students turn their attention back to the classroom.Overall, September proved an exceptionally strong month for education platforms, with widespread traffic growth while students are returning to school. Expect the category to stabilize in the coming months as the school year continues.The Most Visited Websites – US,Social Networks CategoryPositionDomainMonthly traffic1youtube.com11.0B2reddit.com2.9B3facebook.com2.4B4instagram.com1.0B5twitter.com612.1M6linkedin.com455.1M7tiktok.com415.4M8netflix.com366.0M9imdb.com251.4M10pinterest.com246.7MThe Most Visited Websites – US,Education CategoryPositionDomainMonthly traffic1instructure.com467.9M2clever.com156.8M3quizlet.com82.7M4blackboard.com45.6M5schoology.com41.1M6pearson.com37.0M7mheducation.com34.6M8powerschool.com33.3M9cengage.com26.0M10chegg.com24.7MThe Most Visited Websites – US,Streaming Services CategoryPositionDomainMonthly traffic1netflix.com366.0M2hianime.to185.6M3hulu.com137.4M4xfinity.com111.9M5max.com81.6M6peacocktv.com66.7M7disneyplus.com66.2M8crunchyroll.com66.1M9paramountplus.com49.1M10fmovies.co41.6MThe Most Visited Websites – US,Teamwork CategoryPositionDomainMonthly traffic1office.com378.1M2sharepoint.com267.4M3discord.com219.2M4zoom.us182.4M5app.link126.1M6adjust.com119.3M7github.com118.2M8appsflyer.com100.4M9office365.com91.6M10dropbox.com57.6MThe Most Visited Websites – US,Fashion CategoryPositionDomainMonthly traffic1missyusa.com21.5M2stockx.com11.6M3depop.com10.9M4hottopic.com8.8M5uniqlo.com8.5M6zara.com7.6M7jcrew.com7.2M8llbean.com7.0M9landsend.com6.6M10bloomingdales.com6.4MThe Most Visited Websites – US,Retail CategoryPositionDomainMonthly traffic1amazon.com2.4B2ebay.com462.6M3walmart.com359.4M4etsy.com200.0M5temu.com149.1M6target.com121.8M7costco.com91.7M8wayfair.com63.7M9aliexpress.com56.3M10kohls.com48.5MThe Most Visited Websites – US,Travel CategoryPositionDomainMonthly traffic1tripadvisor.com62.6M2airbnb.com58.0M3expedia.com52.8M4aa.com51.7M5booking.com45.0M6united.com41.6M7delta.com40.5M8southwest.com38.4M9marriott.com37.5M10hilton.com24.3MThe Most Visited Websites – US,Media CategoryPositionDomainMonthly traffic1yahoo.com1.7B2cnn.com526.8M3nytimes.com474.3M4msn.com360.9M5foxnews.com331.2M6dailymail.co.uk174.4M7bbc.com163.5M8news.google.com141.5M9nypost.com132.9M10finance.yahoo.com130.2MThe Most Visited Websites – US,Food Delivery CategoryPositionDomainMonthly traffic1doordash.com62.2M2toasttab.com35.1M3kroger.com32.8M4instacart.com32.1M5dominos.com30.6M6ubereats.com18.4M7opentable.com17.2M8publix.com17.1M9square.site16.8M10pizzahut.com16.7MReveal the top market players for any industry with Open .TrendsTry for free",
