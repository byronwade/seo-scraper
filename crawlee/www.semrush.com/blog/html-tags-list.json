You can use tags to format italics, line breaks, objects, bullet points, and more. These tags live in the HTML (or the Hypertext Markup Language) of every webpage. Simply put, HTML is the language of web pages. Examples Of HTML Tags<p> Paragraph Tag </p>The <p> and </p> are the HTML tags and “Paragraph Tag” is the HTML element, i.e. the on-page text. This tag formats any text between the opening <p> tag and the closing </p> tag as a standard paragraph or main body text. <h2> Heading Tag </h2>In this example, <h2> and </h2> are the HTML tags and “Heading Tag” is the HTML element, i.e. the on-page heading. Using this tag will format any text between the opening <h2> tag and the closing </h2> tag as a Heading 2 (a type of subheading.) <b> Bold Tag </b>Here the <b> and </b> are the HTML tags and “Bold Tag” is the HTML element, i.e. the on page text. This tag will format any text between the opening <b> tag and the closing </b> tag as bold.<i> Italic Tag </i>Here, the <i> and </i> are the HTML tags and “Italic Tag” is the HTML element (the on-page text.)This tag will format any text between the opening <i> tag and the closing </i> tag as italic.<u> Underline Tag </u>Here the <u> and </u> are the HTML tags and “Underline Tag” is the HTML element, i.e. the on page text. This tag will format any text between the opening <u> tag and the closing </u> tag as underlined.How to Check Your Site’s HTML TagsIf you already have HTML tags on your web pages and want to check if they’re used correctly, you can do so by looking at the HTML of your page.
