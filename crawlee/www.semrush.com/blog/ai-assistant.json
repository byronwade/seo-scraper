It also offers quick access to information, like the chance of rain in the next hour, so you can go about your day more efficiently.If you own an Androidsmartphone, Google Home, or Wear OS device, you can activate Google Assistant with the touch of a button. Or turn on voice activation and start using it by saying, “Hey, Google.”Once you do, Google’s artificial intelligence is ready to help you get things done in a natural, conversational way.Say you tell the AI assistant, “Hey, Google. Remember that I parked my car in Zone B.” Google will respond with something like, “Ok. I’ll remember that you parked your car in Zone B. I’ll also save a map of your location.”You can use voice commands to ask Google Assistant to do anything you’d typically use your phone for.

ChatGPT: Get Support with Everyday Work TasksChatGPT is an AI chatbot that can help with a range of tasks, from writing content to simplifying complex ideas.Give ChatGPT a prompt and it uses its natural language processing (NLP) to provide a helpful, conversational response.For example, you can ask ChatGPT to come up with content ideas for your marketing. Here, we’ve asked ChatGPT to generate five blog post ideas. These are the results:If you’re not satisfied with the output, you can ask ChatGPT to regenerate the list. When you’ve found a result you’re happy with, you can ask follow-up questions to turn an idea into an outline.That’s just one use case. There are all kinds of other scenarios where the tool can help, depending on your needs.ChatGPT can assist with: Market research: Ask Chat GPT to find competitors, gather publicly available data, or develop buyer personas. Keyword research: Ask Chat GPT to generate a list of unique terms related to your business. Translation: Paste in your content and ask Chat GPT to rewrite it in a different language. Editing and proofreading: Paste in your content to spot typos, improve clarity, and suggest ways to make writing impactful. Learning new subjects: Ask Chat GPT to explain complex ideas in simple terms or give you the need-to-know information about a topic. Writing code: Ask Chat GPT to generate snippets of HTML, Python, PHP, C#, Java, or Javascript. Or have it create Excel spreadsheet formulas.To get the most out of ChatGPT make prompts specific and detailed.For example, if you want ChatGPT to write an email, give it details on your target audience, product, offer, and tone of voice.And don’t expect perfect results every time. Ask it to provide sources or revise answers where necessary. But accept that it won’t always be accurate.ChatGPT is language-based, not experience based, so it cannot offer unique perspectives about a topic. So, it’s important to edit any content it generates before publishing.Simply put: use ChatGPT to assist you in your work, rather than to do it for you.PriceChat GPT is free. OpenAI also offers ChatGPT Plus, with benefits such as faster responses and priority access to new features for $20 per month.Further reading: How to use ChatGPT: Your Step-by-Step Guide7.
