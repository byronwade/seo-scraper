  "content": "ChatGPT is a hugely versatile tool. And with the right ideas and a little practice, it can make your marketing workflow more efficient and effective.In this article we’ll cover eight of the best ways to use ChatGPT for marketing. We’ll also include specific prompts to get you started.But first, here’s a quick refresher on what ChatGPT is.What Is ChatGPT?ChatGPT is a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (AI). It uses natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning technology to understand your queries and prompts. And respond to those prompts using a conversational tone.For example, it can answer simple questions like, “What planet is known as the ‘Red Planet’?”It can summarize information, solve problems, generate creative works, and more.And it’s available to anyone for free through a web app.Here are eight ways youcan use ChatGPT for marketing.1. Get Inspiration for ContentChatGPT can generate all sorts of marketing content, increasing your output and speeding up your production. It’s especially helpful for long-form content like blog posts.With the right prompts, you can fine-tune content to match your content marketing or copywriting approach. And fit your target audience or objectives. Start with a simple prompt like “write a blog post covering [topic]” to get a first draft.You can use this draft as an outline. Or you can refine your prompt to get a second draft that’s closer to what you want.How?Add new information like a word count, target keywords, or tone of voice guidelines. ChatGPT will factor all your requests into a redraft.Keep in mind that the content ChatGPT produces isn’t perfect. Here’s why: Results are imperfect: Unless your prompt is spot-on, the output will need editing. ChatGPT isn’t a mind-reader, so low-detail prompts won’t generate exactly what you want. It’s subject to “hallucinations”: It can make things up and cite false sources ChatGPT can’t access the internet: So it won’t be able to write about things that have happened since its training, which took place in early 2022That means you need to edit heavily and verify any output produced by ChatGPT. Again, use ChatGPT’s drafts as an inspiration instead of the final version of your content.Here are the steps you might take to produce an SEO blog post: Use the SEO Content Template to generate a blog post brief that meets the search intent for your primary keywords. Paste the brief information (including keywords, suggested content length, and recommended readability) into ChatGPT and request a first draft. Edit the output manually to flesh out details and check that all the included information is accurate. Use the SEO Writing Assistant to optimize the blog post for your target keywords.You can streamline this approach to fit your needs.Content Generate ChatGPT Prompt Ideas Write a blog post covering [topic] Generate three emails that will be a part of a newsletter series about [topic] Generate a Facebook or Twitter post about [topic]. Please make sure to include [subject]2. Brainstorm Seed KeywordA vital part of helping your content succeed is ensuring it ranks for desired keywords.ChatGPT can help you brainstorm keywords for your next article.Here’s how.Say you’re writing an article about Taylor Swift for a music website. Find relevant keywords with this prompt:“What keywords should I use in an article about Taylor Swift?”Here’s the response:You might notice that these terms are very basic (and outdated).And ChatGPT doesn’t have data about keyword volume or difficulty, so you have no way of knowing whether these terms are relevant, popular, or easy to rank for.Which is why this is a brainstorming list and by no means the end product.To get more specific and accurate keyword data, go to Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. First, type in one of the ChatGPT keyword suggestions. Let’s stick with “Taylor Swift.”You’ll then see a list of potential keywords and their search volume and keyword difficulty (KD).The search volume column shows you an estimate of how many times a keyword is searched per month.And the KD tells you how easy or difficult it is to rank for that specific keyword. The keyword “Taylor Swift” has a good search volume (3.4 million searches per month). But is very difficult to rank for at 100% KD.Look for terms that get over 100 searches per month by entering “100” in the “from” field of the volume filter. And find keywords that are easier to rank for by adding “50%” to the “to” field of the KD filter.You can also filter out irrelevant keywords or terms you’re not interested in by using the eye icon.Now you have a list of keywords that you can choose from. That you can rank for with less effort.Make a shortlist of keywords that you want to use. And add those to your article.Seed Keyword ChatGPT Prompt Ideas I am writing an article about [topic]. Give me a list of keywords to include in the article. My target keyword is [keyword]. Give me related keywords to target. Generate a list of long-tail keywords related to the keyword [keyword].3. Edit Content QuickerUse ChatGPT as an editing tool to clean up your content and speed up your production process.ChatGPT can both proofread and make content suggestions. It supports inputs of up to 3,000 words, which means it’s great for blog posts.Start by pasting your content into the chatbot.Before you hit enter, add a prompt to the top of the chat. Like: “Check the content below for basic errors like grammar or spelling mistakes:” “Remove passive voice throughout the text pasted below:” “Correct tense changes in the article below:” “Rewrite this content in a more playful, casual tone:”Here’s what ChatGPT will come up with if you ask it to make your content more playful and casual:But again, ChatGPT’s potential to hallucinate and make mistakes means it’s not a foolproof editor. And its user interface (UI) isn’t as well-suited to editing content as dedicated editing tools like Grammarly.Its lack of internet access also means it can’t make effective SEO edits. Why?Because without live visibility into the top search results for keywords, ChatGPT can’t understand current search intent.Consider using Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant to optimize your drafts, instead. The tool will analyze your content for the following: Readability SEO Originality Tone of voiceThat way, your content stays aligned with your brand. And follows all the SEO best practices, giving you a higher chance of ranking better.Content Editing ChatGPT Prompt Ideas Fix any grammar or spelling mistakes in this content: [content] Rewrite this blog post to be more engaging: [content] Write a new conclusion to summarize this blog post: [content] Rewrite any instances of passive voice in this content in active voice: [content] Make this content more suitable for a teenage audience: [content]4. Translate Copy & ContentChatGPT can translate text into different languages. You can use this feature to expand your marketing by creating content for different regions in international marketing campaigns.OpenAI didn’t specifically train ChatGPT to do this, so there’s no official list of supported languages. But ChatGPT claims to be able to work with most major world languages.To translate text, paste your content into ChatGPT and tell it what language you want.You can also use it to understand how to change specific phrases, like “a piece of cake,” that don’t translate literally. ChatGPT’s translation capabilities have lots of great uses.You can translate website content to roll out new languages in an international SEO campaign. Or you can fine-tune pay-per-click (PPC)ad copy or brand taglines so they make sense in the cultural context of another language.Just be aware, as always, that ChatGPT can make mistakes. Not every translation will be perfectly fluent. And the translated text might lack the personality or nuance of a human translation.Translation ChatGPT Prompt Ideas Translate this text into [language]: [content] Would this translated text read naturally to native speakers of [language]?: [content] What’s the equivalent expression for [expression] in [language]? Generate several variants of this tagline in [language]: [tagline] Rewrite this email in [language] and adapt it to the local cultural context: [email copy]5. Generate Schema for SEOSchema markup (also known as structured data) helps search engines understand the information on a webpage. Google uses schema markup to categorize the site and serve rich results.For example, how-to markup tells Google that your content offers step-by-step instructions. Google can then present those steps to searchers right on the search engine results page (SERP).And having rich results can make a difference on the results page.Home Depot takes up the entire above-the-fold portion of the SERP with all its sitelinks. You can learn how to generate and test schema in our step-by-step guide.Or use ChatGPT to generate structured data markup using the recommended format, JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data).For example, here’s the JSON-LD markup ChatGPT generated for an article about Halloween costumes:In this way, ChatGPT can help simplify some of the most complicated aspects of SEO.Schema Markup ChatGPT PromptGenerating schema markup is pretty straightforward. Simply enter the prompt“Can you generate [content type] schema for me?”And ChatGPT will tell you what information it needs. And give you placeholder examples to make it easier for you to give it information.For example, this is the result for “Can you generate schema markup for me?”Simply replace the placeholders and you’ll have your schema markup.6. Generate Title Tags Title tags show Google what your webpage is about. In fact, they’re a ranking factor.They should be between 50 and 60 characters so they don’t get cut off in the SERPs.Title tags appear in the <head> section of your site’s HTML code. Sites like WordPress or Squarespace will set the title tag automatically when you write a post.You can also use ChatGPT. Ensure you make the prompt as specific as possible to avoid keyword stuffing. And be careful not to duplicate other titles on your webpage. Say you’re writing a piece about the best airlines for a travel blog. Type a prompt like this into ChatGPT:“Generate three title tags of no more than 60 characters each for an article about the best airlines.”Here are the results:That’s a promising start. What’s more, ChatGPT can generate HTML code for each title tag:The most difficult and technical parts of creating content are much easier with ChatGPT.Title Tag ChatGPT Prompt Generate three title tags of no more than 60 characters each for an article about [topic] Rephrase the following title tag to make it less than 60 characters: “[title tag]” Generate a maximum 60-character title tag that will attract more clicks for an article about [topic] Generate a maximum 60-character title tag based on the following introduction: “[introduction]”7. Generate Meta DescriptionsMeta descriptions are summaries that let users know about a webpage’s content. They show up in the SERPs like this:Meta descriptions are usually about 105 characters. They should include the page’s primary keyword, along with a call to action (CTA).As with title tags, sites like WordPress can set meta descriptions automatically. But ChatGPT can also help again here. Let’s continue with the airline example from above. Say we typed this prompt into ChatGPT: “Create an SEO meta description of no more than 105 characters for one of the above articles. Include the primary keyword ‘best airlines,’ along with a call to action.”Here’s the result, complete with character count:ChatGPT can also modify this meta description tag for the webpage’s code. Here’s the prompt:“Create a meta description tag for this article that would appear in the <head> section of the webpage's code.”And the result:<meta name=\"description\"content=\"Discover the top-rated airlines for 5-star travel experiences. Your journey to luxury begins here. Book now!\">ChatGPT helps with the technical aspects of SEO and website maintenance so you can focus on writing the best possible content. Meta Description ChatGPT Prompt Ideas Create an SEO meta description of no more than 105 characters for [topic]. Make sure to include the primary keyword [keyword] and a call to action. Rephrase the following meta description to make it no more than 100 words while still keeping it descriptive: “[meta description]” Create a meta description no more than 105 characters about [topic] based on the following title and headers: “[title],” “[header #1],” “[header #2],” “[header #3]”8. Simplify Data AnalysisGet more insight into your data by having ChatGPT analyze it. It can help you understand complex marketing data, get the most from dedicated data analysis platforms, and find new insights.Say you’re analyzing website performance data using Microsoft Excel. ChatGPT can speed up the process by generating complicated Excel formulas in an instant. You can also use it to get step-by-step instructions on how to use Excel’s more complicated features. If you want to manipulate your data in a certain way, explain what you want to see and ask ChatGPT how to get there.ChatGPT can interpret data directly for you too. Show it raw data or customer feedback with a prompt asking for analysis and it will generate insights instantly.But it has limited value in data analysis tasks because of its chat-based user interface. It’s not as intuitive to use as dedicated data analysis platforms. It’s best used as an assistant that helps you make the most of other tools (like Excel in the example above).Data Analysis ChatGPT Prompt Ideas Create an Excel formula to show my data in [data format] What are the 10 most useful Excel formulas for data analysis? How do I create a pivot table to compare five columns of data? Interpret key insights from this data: [data] Reformat this data into a table and order it from largest to smallest: [data]The Limitations of Using ChatGPT for MarketingChatGPT is the most sophisticated consumer-facing AI tool we’ve seen. But it has notable limitations—which means it works best as part of a larger toolkit.These limitations include: No access to the internet, which means it can’t provide accurate responses to current SEO or PPC queries or answer questions about brand new topics A tendency to hallucinate facts, especially when given leading questions, which makes it unreliable for research Difficulty writing text that isn’t obviously AI-generated when compared with a human-written alternative A reliance on user knowledge and skill, in that its effectiveness depends on how effective your prompts areBut you can mitigate some of these limitations. A subscription to ChatGPT Plus unlocks real-time internet access. And practice will improve your ability to write effective prompts that generate better responses. Add ChatGPT to Your Marketing ToolboxChatGPT is like a digital marketing Swiss Army knife. Its versatility, availability, and growing potential make it useful for any marketer. And it can handle diverse tasks.But it isn’t as good at any of them as dedicated tools. So start by integrating it into your existing workflows. Use it alongside other platforms like the Semrush Keyword Magic Tool, Site Audit, and SEO Content Template to get better marketing results faster.",
