How to Do SEO for a New WebsiteCheck out our top nine SEO tips for your new website:1. Choose a Concise and Effective Domain NameThe first thing your new website needs is a domain name. A domain name is your website’s address on the internet. It’s what people type in their browsers to find your site. For example, “semrush.com” is Semrush’s domain name. And having a concise and effective domain name is really important. It can help you attract more traffic and build your brand. Here are a few tips for choosing a good domain name: Use words that describe your niche or topic, such as “seotips.com” or “seohacks.com” Keep it short and simple, no longer than 15 characters and easy to pronounce Avoid numbers, hyphens, and other symbols that can confuse your visitors and look spammy Be unique and memorable like “backlinko.com,” which winks to one of the main SEO topics: backlinksChoosing a concise and effective domain name can take serious time and thought. But it’s worth the effort. 2. Outline Your Site Structure and ArchitectureSite structure is how you organize and link your webpages. It’s important for user experience. And a way to boost SEO for your new site.Here are the main benefits of having a solid site structure: It helps Google find and index the pages on your site It helps visitors find what they’re looking for It helps you avoid duplicate content issues and keyword cannibalizationSo, where do you start?First, sketch out a “skeleton” of the pages your site needs.For example, you could start with a homepage, an about page, a services page, a contact page, and a blog. Then, each of those could have subpages. Like this:When your site is up and running, run a quick audit to make sure there aren’t any crawlability issues. To get started, sign up for a free Semrush account.Click the blue “+ Create project” button in the “My Projects” section.Then, add your domain, and click “Create project.”Like so:You’ll see a project dashboard. Find Site Audit and click “Set up.”Then, select the number of pages you want to crawl and “Website” as the crawl source. And click “Start Site Audit.” Like this:Now, head to the “Issues” tab and select “Crawlability” from the “Category” drop-down menu. You’ll see a list of your site’s crawlability errors, warnings, and notices. Conduct an audit like this at least monthly. And fix any issues that come up.

Set Up Google Search Console and Semrush Tools Google Search Console (GSC) is a free Google tool that helps you monitor and troubleshoot your new site’s SEO performance—specifically in Google search. To set it up, open Search Console and click “Start now.”On the first screen, choose “Domain.” Then, enter your domain, and click “Continue.”You’ll be prompted to verify your domain. Follow Google’s step-by-step instructions to do this. Once you’ve finished verification, you’ll be able to use GSC and review your analytics. (It’s normal not to see any data at first. Especially if your site is brand new). GSC helps you understand how Google sees your site. And how your site appears in Google results. But it doesn’t provide all the data you need. For example, it offers limited information about the keywords you rank for and the sites that link to you. To see the full picture, you need to set up an SEO platform. Like Semrush. You’ll be able to set up other projects, including: Backlink Analytics to analyze your and your competitors’ backlink profiles and compare multiple domains side by side Position Tracking to track your website’s daily rankings for target keywords, locations, and devices Organic Traffic Insights to combine Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and Semrush data and get an accurate overview of your organic search performanceAnd lots more.

And most web traffic today comes from mobile as opposed to desktop.Which means:If your website isn’t mobile-friendly, you could be missing out on traffic, leads, and revenue. To test your site’s mobile-friendliness, you can use Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test. Enter the URL of the page you want to test and click “Test URL.”Then, you’ll see your test results. Like this:Here are a few recommended guidelines for ensuring mobile-friendliness: Make sure your website theme uses responsive design Optimize title tags (which appear as blue, clickable text in search results) and meta descriptions (the copy that can appear below your title tags) for mobile search character limits Avoid intrusive pop-upsFurther reading: The Complete Guide to Mobile SEO5. Study Your SEO CompetitorsSEO competitor research is the process of analyzing your competitors’ SEO strategies, strengths, and weaknesses.And then using those insights to improve your SEO.A competitor analysis allows you to: Understand how competitive your niche is Discover new content ideas Understand how much effort your competitors are putting into SEO Benchmark your SEO performanceTo start, open Organic Research, enter your domain, and click “Search.” Then, go to the “Competitors” tab and scroll down to see the “Organic Competitors” table. This is a list of your top organic competitors. Now, you need to conduct a keyword gap analysis to compare yourself to these competitors. A keyword gap analysis is the process of finding keywords your competitors rank for, but you don’t. And each “gap” is a chance for you to bring in more traffic. First, open the Keyword Gap tool.Then, enter your domain and up to four competitor domains. And click “Compare.”Scroll down to the table and select “Missing.”Now, the table only shows the keywords all four competitors rank for, but not you. These keywords represent opportunities for you to create content and fill in those gaps. Further reading: How to Use Competitor Keywords to Improve Your Strategy6. Conduct Keyword ResearchKeyword research is the process of identifying, analyzing, and choosing keywords to optimize your content for SEO.And doing keyword research right helps you: Understand what your target audience is searching for Tailor your content to your audience Drive more traffic to your siteDoing a keyword gap analysis is a good starting point.

Like this:This first step will help you see what people are searching for. And group keywords into topics and subtopics. For example, take a look at the column on the left. You can immediately see different groups—like “shop,” “menu,” “recipe,” “review,” etc. Click on relevant groups to find related keywords. And do this with other seed keywords from your niche. You’ll get tons of ideas of pages you can build, services you can offer, and content you can create.

Create Content Optimized for SEOWhen you start a new website, you have a lot of content to create from scratch. And optimizing for SEO is critical.Here’s how:Nail Search IntentSearch intent is the reason or motivation behind someone’s search query. There are four main types of search intent: Informational: When a searcher wants to learn more about something (e.g., “what is specialty coffee”) Commercial: When a searcher wants to do research before buying (e.g., “best home coffee machine”) Navigational: When a searcher is searching for a specific website or page (e.g., “starbucks login”) Transactional: When a searcher wants to buy or complete an action (e.g., “buy specialty coffee”)And satisfying intent is one of Google’s top priorities. Which means:If you want to rank high on Google, you need to understand intent. And create content that matches it. For example, you should create a page that makes it easy for the user to buy if you’re targeting a keyword with transactional search intent. Don’t create a blog post. Similarly, create a helpful and comprehensive blog post if you’re targeting a keyword with informational intent. Not a product page. To quickly find any keyword’s intent, run it through Keyword Overview. You’ll find its intent in the widget box labeled “Intent.”Further reading: What Is Search Intent? A Complete GuideOptimize for On-Page SEOOn-page SEO is the process of optimizing specific elements of a webpage so it can rank higher and bring in more traffic.

Select or enter your domain and click “Get ideas.”You’ll then see a dashboard with tons of optimization ideas conveniently grouped by category. Click on the “Optimization Ideas” tab. And you’ll see a table with the ideas sorted by priority. Like this:This priority is based on the number of optimization ideas, the page’s potential traffic, and how easy it would be to implement those ideas. Start with the highest priority pages first. These will likely yield the best results. To do this, click on the blue “# ideas” button. And you’ll see a report with all of the ideas for that specific page. Hover over “Why should I do this?” to learn more about the reasoning behind the idea. Work on implementing the ideas the tool suggests. And you’ll boost the chances of your most important pages ranking higher. Further reading: On-Page SEO: What It Is and How to Do It8.
