And the percentage of traffic their websites get compared to the total traffic for your market.Once you’ve identified competitors, you can visit their websites and analyze the following: Product/service and features: What are the core features of their product or service? Does it have any features you’re missing? Growth strategy: Are they using a product-led or sales-led growth strategy? Pricing: What does their pricing look like? Do they offer discounts?
