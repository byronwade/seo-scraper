Drag them to isolate an object you want to do a reverse image search for. Google will display image results relevant to the isolated object Click the image result you’re interested in Click “Visit” to visit the image result’s pageReasons to Use a Reverse Image SearchReverse image searches are useful if you want to:Build BacklinksDoing a reverse image search for visuals you created to be shared is a good way to find websites that use them. And ask for backlinks (links from other websites that point to your website) in the image credit.Why?Because the more backlinks your website gets from authoritative websites, the higher it may rank in the search results.Let’s say you created an infographic you’re hoping others will share on their websites.Do a reverse image search using it and visit each image result.Check whether there’s an attribution line that links to your website. (If there’s no credit at all and you haven’t granted the website permission to use your image, that’s image theft. Which we’ll cover later on.)If you find websites that haven’t included backlinks, reach out. And ask them for one.Use the Link Building Tool to simplify this process.Follow the Link Building Tool configuration guide to set up your project. Then, head to the “Prospects” tab. And click “+ Add” under the “Uploaded” box.Add the domains you found using your image without linking back to you and click “Add new domains.”Click “Show results” in the pop-up that appears to add these domains as prospects.They’ll then show in the tool. Like this:Then, click the arrow next to the “To In Progress” button for each of these domains and select “Link from mention.”This will send them to the “In Progress” tab. Where you can craft personalized emails asking those who’ve used your image to include a link to you in the attribution.Learn More about an ObjectDoing a reverse image search is especially helpful if you don’t know what the object is called. Which makes searching for it with text difficult.Getting this information is simple. Just upload an image of it to a visual search engine like Google.Find an Image’s SourceYou can discover an image’s source or creator using a reverse image search. So you can provide appropriate credit if you’re using it.Follow the instructions above to do a Google reverse image search using an image URL or an image you’ve saved to your library. And click “Find image source” at the top.Then, browse the results to learn who the image’s creator is.Even if a website you click through to isn’t the image’s original source, it may have provided image credit. Use that credit to identify the image’s creator.Looking for older publish dates may also help. Why?Because the oldest result may be for the image’s first use. By the creator themselves.Just know this technique isn’t perfect. For example, a page that was published 10 years ago and then updated just a few months ago to include the image you’re searching can appear to be the original source when it’s not.Finally, make sure you have permission to use the image in the first place (there’s more on copyright law below). If not, you’ll want to reach out to the original source to ask whether you can use the image. Check for Image TheftConducting a reverse image search with one of your images can reveal which websites have used it without your permission.If they haven’t received permission, they might be violating your copyright. And you may be able to send a takedown notice.The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) empowers copyright owners to send takedown notices to internet service providers (ISPs) when others use their content—including images—online without permission. These ISPs include search engines and social media platforms.After receiving the takedown notice, the ISP is required to disable access to the infringing image (or other content) as soon as possible.Or, reach out to the website owner directly to discuss a copyright licensing deal.You may consider speaking with an intellectual property lawyer to learn more about your legal rights.Reverse Image Search ToolsNeed more advanced reverse image search tools?Try these platforms.TinEyeThe TinEye reverse image search engine looks for images similar or identical to an image you provide.It offers in-depth results.
