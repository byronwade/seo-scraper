  "content": "There are a lot of SEO keyword tracking tools out there. And picking the right one can be challenging.Our list of keyword rank tracker tools gives you the run-down on 11 of our favorite platforms, including pricing, who we recommend them for, and each tool’s coolest features.But before we dive in, let’s recap why these tools are worth the investment.Why Are Keyword Tracking Tools Important?Whether you’re tracking 10 keywords or 100, keyword rank tracker tools save you time. You no longer have to type individual keywords into Google to see how you rank, browse competitors’ websites to figure out which keywords they’re targeting,ormanually update row after row of keyword info in a spreadsheet. With these low-level tasks out of the way, you can focus on more thoughtful keyword optimization.Here are some of the specific ways these tools make your life easier:Frequent Updates on RankingsMost keyword tracking tools automatically update keyword rankings at least once a day. Meaning you get a timely, bird’s-eye view of all your keyword fluctuations in one convenient spot.This makes it easy to figure out which keywords and content you should focus on to improve your SEO.If you’re manually tracking desktop, mobile, and local keyword rankings, it’s easy to fall behind. Then, you can get blindsided by substantial ranking drops or miss opportunities to promote a piece that recently climbed the search engine results page (SERP).Fast Competitive AnalysisKeyword tracking tools let you skip the hassle of manually comparing yourself to competitors with tons of open tabs and messy spreadsheets.Many of these platforms stack up the keywords you and your competitors rank for in one central spot. This clear overview helps you uncover new keywords to target. Clear Visibility Into Keyword Cannibalization Many keyword tracking tools can easily detect keyword cannibalization—where you’ve targeted the same keyword and search intent on different web pages. This is important because keyword cannibalization hurts your ability to rank.Why?Because it makes it hard for search engines to figure out which page is the most relevant for that specific keyword.Automated Performance Reporting Most keyword tracking tools automate tedious reporting. With a click or two, you can pull key info like search engine rankings and traffic numbers into digestible reports for stakeholders.Besides giving you a deeper understanding of your SEO results, this saves you a lot of time. So you have more bandwidth to analyze reports instead of just building them.Top Keyword Tracking ToolsThese 11 platforms all cover keyword ranking basics. But some are more advanced than others.
