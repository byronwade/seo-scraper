  "content": "In this post, you’ll learn exactly how to create and implement an effective SaaS SEO strategy—step by step.This is the same strategy we’ve used to grow our own blog to over 1.5 million organic search visitors around the world per month.So if you want to get higher Google rankings, you’ll love the actionable steps in this guide.Let’s get started.What Is SaaS SEO?SaaS SEO is the process of optimizing your SaaS website to improve its visibility and rankings on search engines like Google and Bing. To attract more organic traffic, leads, and customers who are interested in the software solution your SaaS company offers. It involves implementing different SEO techniques, such as keyword research, technical SEO (optimizing your site for search engines and the user experience), and link building (gaining links that point to your site)—and requires a SaaS-specific approach. For both B2C and B2B SaaS, SEO efforts can help you: Attract potential customers Build trust and authority Improve conversion rates Reduce customer acquisition costsAnd more.Why SEO Is Important for SaaS BusinessesSEO helps you reach and attract potential customers looking for software solutions like yours. Whether you do it yourself or work with a SaaS SEO agency.Compared to most other types of businesses, SaaS companies rely more heavily on their websites to showcase their products, features, benefits, pricing, and testimonials. Which means:Having a high-ranking site that provides relevant and valuable information is crucial for generating leads, conversions, and revenue.Here are some of the main benefits of SEO for SaaS companies.Scale Growth ExponentiallySEO can drive consistent and qualified organic traffic to your site. Organic traffic is traffic that comes from unpaid search results. And it’s valuable because it represents visits coming from people who are actively interested in the topics surrounding your business and offering.As you create more content, your site ranks for more keywords. And you can attract more traffic from different regions, countries, and languages. Which can help you expand your customer base and increase your global presence.Imagine this at scale.The more high-quality SEO content you create, the more traffic you'll likely drive. And this is exactly one of the techniques SaaS companies use for growth.Reduce Customer Acquisition CostsSEO can reduce customer acquisition costs (CAC) and increase customer lifetime value (CLV). CAC is the money you spend to acquire a new customer. While CLV is the money you earn from a customer over their entire relationship with your business. And SEO is one of the most cost-effective ways to lower your CAC and increase your CLV.Why? Because in pay-per-click (PPC) search campaigns like the one below, you pay for every single click to your website. Drive more clicks, pay more money. And with paid ads, traffic stops when you stop paying.SEO is quite the opposite. The cost per acquisition is initially high. But it continuously drops as growth compounds over time. Because the content you create can continue to rank and attract visitors for months or even years with very little additional investment.Let’s say you sell project management software to other companies. With SEO, you could rank for keywords like: \"best project management software\" \"project management software for agencies\" \"how to manage multiple projects\"These terms can represent different segments and stages of the buying process. And SEO allows you to capture them all, without paying anything aside from what it takes to create and maintain your content.Especially for B2B SaaS, SEO’s cost efficiency can be huge. Because those companies tend to have higher acquisition costs than their B2C counterparts.Further reading: The ROI of SEO: How to Measure SEO ROI (with Formulas)Convert Customers from Other ChannelsSEO can complement and enhance your other marketing channels. Such as social media, email, and paid ads.How?It can provide additional touchpoints and opportunities for prospects who already recognize you to interact with your brand. For example, you can use SEO to drive traffic to high-converting pages focused on keywords your customers are likely to search after they’ve seen your Google ads and LinkedIn posts. And then use those pages to convert visitors into leads or customers.How Is SaaS SEO Different from Traditional SEO?SEO for SaaS companies is different from regular SEO in two main ways:First, SaaS SEO is all about personas and problems. You need to know who your target customers are, what they struggle with, and how your software can help them.Second, SaaS (particularly B2B SaaS) SEO is often more about conversions than traffic. You’re not selling a one-off product. You’re selling a long-term solution. So, you need to optimize your site and content for sign-ups—not just clicks.How do you do that? By using different types of content (like case studies, demos, and free trials) to show your prospects your software’s value and benefits. Across the entire customer life cycle. SaaS SEO and the Marketing FunnelIn SaaS SEO, it’s important to understand the different stages of the marketing funnel. And how to target the right keywords for each stage.The marketing funnel is a model that describes the customer journey from awareness to purchase in three main phases. And if you align your SaaS SEO strategy with the marketing funnel, you can attract more qualified leads, nurture them with relevant content, and convert them into paying customers.Let’s look at the different types of keywords across the funnel. We’ll use customer relationship management (CRM) software company Pipedrive as an example:NoteWe used Organic Research to uncover all the keywords in this section.Top-of-the-Funnel Keywords for SaaS Top-of-the-funnel (ToFu) keywords are search queries people use when they’re looking for a solution to a problem or need. They’re not necessarily aware of your product or brand, but they are interested in learning more about the topic. For Pipedrive, a good example of some ToFu keywords they're ranking for are: “sales pipeline” “gross sales” “gross sales vs net sales”Someone searching for these keywords isn’t looking for Pipedrive, specifically. But they’re likely working in sales and browsing for a solution Pipedrive offers. The point of targeting ToFu keywords is to generate awareness and interest in your product category. And to educate prospects about the benefits of your solution. You should create content that answers their questions, provides value, and builds trust. Some types of content that work well for ToFu keywords are: Blog posts Ebooks Guides VideosMiddle-of-the-Funnel Keywords for SaaSMiddle-of-the-funnel (MoFu) keywords are search queries prospects use when they’re evaluating options and comparing features and benefits.They’re aware a solution exists, but they aren’t ready to buy yet. They’re looking for more information and guidance to help them make a decision. For Pipedrive, this means keywords like: “simple crm” “crm experience” “format of a business emails with an example”The point of targeting MoFu keywords is to generate consideration for your product. And to persuade prospects that your solution is the best fit for their needs. You should create content that showcases your product’s value proposition, differentiators, and success stories. Some types of content that work well for MoFu keywords include: Case studies Testimonials Product features DemosBottom-of-the-Funnel Keywords for SaaSBottom-of-the-funnel (BoFu) keywords are search queries prospects use when they’re ready to buy or sign up for your product. They know a solution exists, and they know who provides it. They just need a final push or incentive to take action. For Pipedrive, this means focusing on keywords like: “pipedrive pricing” “pipedrive quickbooks integration” “pipedrive forms”The point of targeting BoFu keywords is to generate conversions and sales for your product. And to overcome any objections or doubts your prospects might have.You can create content that reinforces your product’s benefits, offers discounts or bonuses, and provides social proof and guarantees. Some types of content that work well for BoFu keywords are: Landing pages Sales pages FAQsPiecing Together the Entire Marketing FunnelKeep in mind that there will always be people at different stages of the customer journey. And that the journey isn’t always linear. Some prospects might be in the BoFu stage, but then go back to some of your ToFu content to learn more about a high-level topic. Or be in the ToFu stage but ready to purchase soon after.The key is creating content that connects these different stages. So prospects can move forward at their own pace. For example, this article focused on “sales pipeline” covers the basics and establishes Pipedrive as an authority on the topic. Within the article, they have internal links to other valuable content. And also include a form that allows users to download a guide in exchange for their contact information. To convert them into leads.They also give a prominent spotlight to their own solution.Finally, interested readers who want to rapidly move through the funnel are just a click away from signing up for a free trial. By strategically connecting your content across the funnel, you're better able to guide prospects toward becoming paying customers.Further reading: ToFu, MoFu, BoFu: A Practical Guide to the Conversion FunnelA 9-Step Plan to Create Your SaaS SEO StrategyHere’s a step-by-step SaaS SEO strategy you can use to boost your organic traffic, leads, and conversions.

Set Your Goals and KPIsSetting goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) is the most important part of any SEO strategy, SaaS or not. You need to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve and how you’ll measure progress. First, your goals. Goals are the big-picture outcomes you want to achieve with SEO, such as: Boosting brand awareness and authority Attracting more qualified leads and customers Lowering customer acquisition costs and increasing customer lifetime value Educating and engaging your target audience with valuable contentKPIs are the specific metrics that show how well your SEO efforts are working. And how close you are to your goals.For example: Organic traffic: How many visits your site gets from search engines Organic conversions: How many people take a desired action on your site. Like signing up for a free trial, requesting a demo, or subscribing to your newsletter. Organic rankings: How high your website ranks in the search engine results pages (SERPs) for your target keywords Organic click-through rate (CTR): The percentage of clicks on your site in the SERPs Organic bounce rate: The percentage of visits that end without engaging with your content Organic retention rate: The percentage of people who come back to your site after their first organic visit Organic revenue: How much money your site generates from organic trafficThink about your business goals. And which KPIs can help show your progress. It’ll help you have a clear sense of direction and a way to measure success. Further reading: SEO KPIs: 12 KPIs for SEO to Track & Measure2. Define Your Customer PersonasThe next step in SaaS SEO is to figure out who your target audience is.And the best way to do that is to do research and create customer personas.Customer personas are fictional characters that represent your ideal customers. And include details like: Demographics: age, gender, location, education, income, etc. Psychographics: interests, hobbies, values, attitudes, etc. Behaviors: online habits, search patterns, social media usage, etc. Needs: problems, challenges, goals, desires, etc.And they’re important for SaaS SEO.Why?Because they allow you to understand who your target audience is, what they’re looking for, and how they make decisions. Which helps you create content that matches their search intent (the purpose behind their query), solves their problems, and guides them through the buyer’s journey.Start by having a customer persona template you can fill out. Like this one:Then, use a tool like One2Target to learn more about your audience.Add your domain and click “Analyze.”The tool will provide four reports with information about your audience’s demographics, socioeconomic status, behaviors, and more. Use this data to segment your audience. Then, divide prospects into different groups based on their similarities and differences. For example, you can segment them by location, industry, education level, budget, etc. Or a combination of characteristics.Then, create a different customer persona for each segment using the templates. Finally, validate and update your personas. Test them with real customers and prospects. And get feedback from your sales and customer service teams. And update your personas regularly to reflect any changes in your market and target customer behavior.3. Find Your Competitors and Analyze Their StrategiesOne of the best ways to improve your SaaS SEO performance is to learn from your competitors. Why? Because they can show you what does and doesn’t work in your niche. So you can capitalize on their weaknesses and replicate their strengths. Here’s how to find and analyze your competitors:Open Organic Research, enter your domain name, and click “Search.”Then, choose the “Competitors” tab to see a list of your top organic search competitors.Click on any competitor in the chart to learn more about their organic traffic trends, top keywords, top pages, and more. Then, find keywords your competitors rank for but you don’t. To do this, use the Keyword Gap tool. Enter your domain and up to four competitors’ domains. Then, click “Compare.”Scroll down to the table and select “Missing.” To show only keywords you don’t rank for but your competitors do. You can also conduct a backlink gap analysis to find sites linking to your competitors but not to you. Open the Backlink Gap tool, add your domain, add your competitor’s domains, and click “Find prospects.”The table below shows the referring domains that send backlinks to the competitors you entered. You can get more specific information about the links and URLs from each referring domain by clicking on the drop-down arrows.This will show the domain’s Authority Score (a number out of 100 that indicates how reputable a site is), anchor text (the clickable text used for the link) and target URL, the date the backlink was first found, and more.Like this:Now, you have a list of sites you can reach out to for backlinks to your content (more on that later). All of this probably sounds extensive. And it should be extensive.You'll want to know as much as possible about what's driving your competitors' strategies. Then, you can feed this insight into your own roadmap.Further reading: What Is a Competitor Analysis & How to Do It4. Build a Keyword List Around Pain PointsOne of the secrets to SaaS SEO is to understand the problems or challenges your target personas have. And how your product can solve them. That way, you can create content that attracts and educates potential customers at the top of the funnel.Top-of-the-funnel keywords are usually informational in nature. And often have high search volumes but low conversion rates. But that’s OK. The goal now is to bring people in to build awareness and trust with them. Here’s how you can start: Brainstorm the common questions, pain points, or goals your personas have related to your product or niche. For example, if you offer a sales CRM software (like Pipedrive), you might think of questions like: How do you build a sales pipeline? What is a sales funnel? How do you measure and track a sales team’s performance?For more ideas, use the Keyword Magic Tool. Open the tool and enter a seed keyword from your niche. A seed keyword is a broad keyword you can use to find other keyword ideas. And you’ll get a table with tons of ideas based on the keyword you entered. Then, click the “Intent” drop-down menu and select “Informational.” This will show only keywords with informational intent (when searchers want to find answers to questions). Do this for several seed keywords, and you’ll have a long list of ToFu keywords in no time. Then, you need to create content that provides value to your personas based on these keywords. And that positions your product as a potential solution. Here are some tips for creating top-of-the-funnel content for your SaaS company: Use the keywords in your content title, headings, URL, meta description, and body Use storytelling, data, statistics, and examples Add clear and compelling calls to action (CTAs) that encourage your personas to take the next stepTo streamline your content creation process and ensure it's optimized for both readers and search engines, use Semrush's SEO Writing Assistant tool. Just write (or copy and paste) your text in the editor. And the tool will assess your content in real-time for SEO, tone of voice, readability, and originality.If you get stuck, use the AI-powered Smart Writer features to help reword sections, generate new content, or come up with ideas.Once you’re done, you can move the article forward in your editing process. Or publish it directly to your WordPress site. By creating content focused on your personas’ challenges like this, you can educate your potential customers and lead them to your product.Further reading: Keyword Research for SEO: What It Is & How to Do It What Is Search Intent? A Complete Guide5. Find Keywords for High-Value Landing PagesAs you go down the sales funnel, you need to make sure you're targeting the right keywords for your commercial pages.Your commercial pages are your product and feature pages—those that provide insights into what your software offers.Think keywords like: “best sales crm” “crm experience” “free sales crm” “sales pipeline management tools”Once you're ranking for these types of queries, you'll be able to drive more traffic that's closer to converting. These searchers are actively looking for a solution like the one you offer. So, you need to make sure you're covering all bases and aren't missing out on terms your personas are searching.Find these keywords by using the “Intent” filter and selecting the box next to “Commercial” in the Keyword Magic Tool. Then, optimize your landing pages for these keywords. By using them in natural and relevant ways. For example, include your keywords in your page title, meta description, headings, subheadings, body text, images, and calls to action. You should also use synonyms, variations, and related keywords to avoid keyword stuffing (an outdated tactic meant to “trick” search engines) and improve relevance.This is all easy to do with Semrush's On-Page SEO Checker. Follow the steps to configure the tool. And be sure to use the “Manually” tab on the “Add pages to optimize” screen. So you can make sure all your landing pages are included.Click “Collect ideas” when you’re done.Once you run the tool, it will evaluate your content against your top competitors and give you an overview of how much your organic traffic could increase by implementing the suggestions.Scroll down to “TOP pages to optimize” and click “# ideas” next to the first landing page you want to address.You’ll then see a list of recommendations that can help your page perform better.For example, it can help you: Improve readability: To make your content easier to read and understand for both users and search engineS Enhance semantic relevance: To enrich your content with related keywords and topics to include that can make your content more discoverable Avoid keyword stuffing: To ensure you're not overusing keywords, which can hurt your rankings and make your content less appealing to readers Optimize meta descriptions: To create meta descriptions that accurately reflect the content of your pages and entice searchers to click6. Build Out a Comparison Keyword PlanThe next step in your SaaS SEO strategy is to target comparison keywords. Essentially, \"[you] vs. [them]\" keywords.Why?Once your prospects get lower down in the sales funnel, there's a good chance they'll be comparing solutions. Hopefully, one of those solutions is yours.These comparison keywords are important for a few reasons: People who search for these keywords are usually getting ready to buy—they just need a little push Writing content focused on them helps show how your product is different from (and better than) your competitors’ products These terms often attract qualified traffic and leads—people who know you exist and are more likely to purchaseFind these keywords with the Keyword Magic Tool.Just search for your product name, click the “Include keywords” filter, type “vs,” and click “Apply.”And you’ll get a filtered list like this:Once you have a list of comparison keywords, create content for them. Here are some tips to do that: Use the keywords in your page title, meta description, headings and subheadings, body text, and images Present the facts and features for both products without being overly promotional or negative Use a clear and consistent format (like a table, a list, or a chart) to compare the products Clearly explain how your product can solve the user’s problem or meet their needs Provide a clear and compelling call to action, such as a free trial, a demo, or a discountHere's a great example from Pipedrive that compares Pipedrive vs. HubSpot:Even if these keywords have a low search volume, it's important to capture them. Because content geared toward lower-funnel searches can persuade users to convert. Get in there first before your competitors do. And if they're already targeting these queries, make sure your page is better.7. Create Better Content Than Your CompetitorsContent is the backbone of any SaaS growth strategy. It helps you rank for relevant keywords, attract qualified traffic, and convert visitors into customers.But creating content isn’t enough. You also need to create better content than your competitors.First, you need to see what’s already working for them. Open Organic Research, enter any competitor’s URL, and click “Search.” Then, head to the “Pages” tab. These are all of your competitor’s pages sorted by traffic. Review the best-performing pages and look for patterns. For example, consider: Are they mostly blog posts? Or something different? Is the content short-form or long? Do they use lots of videos?Use the answers to these questions to guide your content strategy. And replicate what’s already working in a better way. Here are some tips to help you create better content: Write for humans. Write in a clear, conversational, and engaging tone. Use headings, bullets, images, and charts to break up your text and make it easy to scan. Avoid filler, jargon, and errors. Deliver value to your readers. Don’t just pitch your product. Solve your readers’ problems, and show them how you can help them. Provide practical tips, insights, examples, and case studies. Optimize your content for search engines. Use your target keywords and related terms in your content, but don’t overdo it. Use them naturally and in context. Include them in your title, headings, URL, meta description, and image alt text.
