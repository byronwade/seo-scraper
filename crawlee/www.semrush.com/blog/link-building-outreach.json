  "content": "You might already know that link building is huge for SEO. But how do you actually get other sites to link to your amazing content? The answer: link building outreach. Link building outreach is all about contacting the right people with the right message at the right time. And in this guide, you’ll learn exactly how to do that. What Is Link Building Outreach?Link building outreach is the process of contacting other sites or influencers and asking them to create links that point back to your own website.The purpose is to increase your site’s visibility and credibility—which can help improve its rankings on search engines. But getting links isn’t easy. You can't just spam people with random requests. You need to offer them something valuable in return.That's where link building outreach comes in.Link building outreach involves finding relevant and authoritative websites, crafting personalized and persuasive messages, and building relationships with other webmasters.The goal is to convince them that your content is worth linking to. And that linking to it will benefit them and their audience.TipNot sure who to reach out to? Use the Link Building Tool to find prospects and manage your link building campaign. Why Is Link Building Outreach Important?Link building outreach is one of the most effective ways to boost your website’s visibility in search engine results.Why?Because link building outreach helps you get high-quality backlinks from other relevant and authoritative sites in your niche.And backlinks are like votes of confidence for your website. They signal to search engines that your content is valuable, trustworthy, and relevant to your target audience.The more high-quality backlinks you have, the higher your website will likely rank for your target keywords. And the higher you rank, the more organic traffic you typically get from search engines.That’s why link building outreach is important. It’s not just about getting links. It’s about getting links that matter.How Link Building Outreach WorksSo, you know that link building outreach is all about getting other websites to link to your content.But how do you actually do it?It boils down to three main steps:1. Create High-Quality Content People Will Be Interested inThe first step is to create content that’s valuable, relevant, and engaging for your target audience.This could be a blog post, a video, an infographic, a case study, a guide, or anything else that provides useful information. Or solves a problem.The key is to make sure your content is: Original: Don’t copy or rehash what others have already said. Add your own insights, data, and perspective. Comprehensive: Cover the topic in depth and don’t leave any gaps or questions unanswered Actionable: Give your readers clear and specific steps they can take to apply what they’ve learned Visual: Use images, screenshots, charts, graphs, and other visual elements to make your content more appealing and easier to understand2. Identify Websites, Journalists, or Influencers Who May Want Your ContentThe next step is to find potential link partners who are interested in your topic and have a similar or complementary audience to yours.There are many ways to do this, but here are some of the most common: Use Google: Search for keywords related to your content and see which websites rank. You can also use advanced search operators like “inurl:,” “intitle:,” and “intext:” to narrow down your results. Use social media: Look for popular posts, hashtags, and accounts that are related to your content on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. See who’s sharing, commenting, and engaging with them. Use tools: Use tools like our Link Building Tool to find potential prospects you can reach out to. Or Backlink Analytics to see who’s linking to your competitors and which types of content tend to earn the most backlinks. 3. Pitch Your Content in a Personalized WayThe final step is to contact your prospects and ask them to link to your content.But don’t just send a generic email that says “Hey, I have this awesome content. Please link to it.”That won’t work.You need to: Personalize: Address your prospect by name and mention something specific about their website, content, or profile that shows you did your research and aren’t spamming them. Explain: Express why your content is relevant, valuable, and useful for them and their audience. Highlight your content’s main benefits and features. And how it can help them achieve their goals or solve their problems. Ask: Ask for a link in a polite and friendly way. Don’t be pushy or demanding. Make it easy for them to say yes by providing a clear call to action (CTA) and a link to your content.Here’s an example of a good outreach email:Subject line: Loved your post on SEO trends for 2024Hey David,I’m Carlos, a content marketer at Semrush.I just read your post on SEO trends for 2024 and really enjoyed it.

TipSign up for a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along with the steps in this guide. The Skyscraper TechniqueThe skyscraper technique is a tactic where you find the best piece of content on your topic, create something better, reach out to people who linked to the original, and ask for them to link to you instead.This technique works because you’re not reinventing the wheel. You’re building on what’s already working. And you’re offering something valuable to the people who care about your topic.Here’s how to execute the skyscraper technique in three simple steps:1. Find a Popular Piece of Content on Your TopicThe first step is to find content that’s already attracted a lot of links from other sites. This is your base for creating something better.One way to do this is to enter a competitor’s domain into Backlink Analytics and head to the “Indexed Pages” tab. You’ll see a list of your competitor’s pages sorted by the number of referring domains (i.e., websites linking to those pages). Use the external link icon to view the pages in a new tab. Do this for at least the top five.Analyze them in more detail. And look at the format, style, and length. For example: Do they use lots of visual assets? Are the formats more short-form or long-form? Are they how-to guides, listicles, templates, or something different?Then, click the number in the “Backlinks” column to see all the pages linking to that resource. Those are the prospects you’ll reach out to.Do this for several competitors. To compile a list of potential topics you can create pieces around. Then, choose one that matches your niche and audience. This is what you’re going to create content for to improve upon what your competitor created and outrank them. 2. Create a Better Version of That ContentThe second step is to create a better version of the content you found in step one.This means providing more value, more depth, more insights, more examples, more visuals, and more up-to-date information than the original content.But what does “better” mean?It depends on the content type and format. But here are some general ways to make your content better: Make it longer and more comprehensive: Cover more angles and details. Provide more examples, case studies, and data. And include more images, videos, and infographics. Make it more current and relevant: Update any outdated information, statistics, or references. Add new trends, insights, and developments. And address any recent changes or challenges in the industry or niche. Make it more engaging and user-friendly: Write in a clear, concise, and conversational tone. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and lists to break up the text. Use transitions, hooks, and storytelling to keep the reader interested. And optimize your content for SEO and readability. Make it more actionable and practical: Provide clear and specific steps, tips, and advice. Include tools, resources, and templates that the reader can use. And show the results and benefits of reading your content.The goal is to create a piece of content that’s so good, it makes the original piece look outdated, incomplete, or boring.TipUse the SEO Writing Assistant to check for SEO-friendliness, readability, tone of voice, originality, and more.

Promote Your Content to the Right PeopleThe third and final step is to promote your content to the sites that linked to the original piece. These are your ideal link prospects. Because they’ve shown interest in your topic and are willing to link to similar content.Here’s how you can reach those prospects:Add the URL of the original resource you chose to improve to Backlink Analytics and head to the “Backlinks” tab. You’ll see all the pages that link to the resource.Then, open each page to see if you can find the author and their contact information. If the page doesn’t list an author, try reaching out to someone on the editorial/content team.And know that there are tons of ways to find email addresses. For example, you can use a prospecting tool like FindThatLead Domain Searcher to search a website, see who works there, and gather those employees’ email addresses. Once you have the contact information for each page’s author, craft a personalized and compelling email—don’t use generic or spammy templates. Write a short and friendly email that addresses the recipient by name, compliments their work, introduces your content, explains why your piece is better than the original piece they linked to, and asks for a link.

The key is finding outdated links on pages within your niche that have a quality backlink profile. TipYou can quickly check the quality of any website’s backlink profile by running it through Backlink Analytics and looking at the “Authority Score” widget. 1. Locate Outdated ContentFirst, find resources or sites that are outdated or inactive. Links can often become obsolete due to: Rebranding New URLs Defunct services Defunct products Lack of maintenanceTo find these now outdated resources, you can use the following advanced search strings or search modifiers on Google: “service not available” + [industry keyword/article topic] “we have moved” + [industry keyword/article topic] “page no longer exists” + [industry keyword/article topic] “this website is no longer updated” + [industry keyword/article topic] “this page is no longer updated” + [industry keyword/article topic]Further reading: How to Use Google Advanced Search Operators to Improve Your SEO2. Find Backlinks to Outdated ContentOnce you have a list of outdated resources, use Backlink Analytics to find the pages linking to each of them. 3. Create or Update ContentCreate a new page or update an existing page with high-quality, helpful content. You want your content to be as unique and engaging as possible.For every link building technique, the resource you pitch needs to be excellent. Because you want people to want to link to it.4. Promote Your ContentYour last step is to find the authors or site owners and promote your new, updated content. Let them know about their outdated link. And kindly pitch yours. Guest PostingGuest posting involves writing and publishing articles on other websites or blogs in exchange for a backlink to your own site.Here’s how you can start.1. Find Authoritative Blogs in Your IndustryFirst, find high-performing or authoritative blogs in your industry that accept guest posts. Otherwise, you may be wasting your SEO outreach efforts. To find these blogs, try using different search strings. Like these: “Guest author” + [industry keyword] “Guest post” + [industry keyword]Then, use Domain Overview to analyze each site. And pay special attention to the overall traffic, Authority Score (a metric that estimates how reputable a site is), and backlink profile.2. Request a Guest PostNext, you’ll need to contact these blogs in an approachable manner. Not all are equally as receptive to guest posting. It might help to already have the article created. So they can review it while considering your pitch. 3. Deliver Content with LinksThe final step involves writing the guest post if you haven’t yet. Your guest content should be just as engaging, helpful, and accurate as the content you create for your own website. If not more so. Then, ensure that a backlink to your site with relevant anchor text is included in the article. This step is different for every prospect you contact, so make sure you follow their guidelines.
