Research Your Competitors Identify your competitors. You’ll want to understand the businesses you’re competing with for audience engagement and attention.Then, use these insights to shape your own social media content strategy.Start by looking for direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors sell similar products or services, target the same audience, and compete for market share Indirect competitors sell different products or services, target the same audience, and potentially compete for market shareFor example, let’s say you’re a burger restaurant. A direct competitor could be Five Guys, Shake Shack, or Wendy’s. Chipotle or Taco Bell would be an indirect competitor because they sell different products (e.g., Mexican food) but target the same audience (fast-food enthusiasts). Knowing who your competitors are means you can set benchmarks. And use them to see how your bids for audience attention stack up against the competition.Use Market Explorer to find your competitors. And set your industry benchmarks.First, select “Find Competitors” and enter your domain. Select a location from the drop-down if you want to. Then click “Research a market.”Look under “Market Consolidation” to see a list of important competitors in your industry. Along with their market share. Scroll down to the “Growth Quadrant” widget. This ranks your business and your competitors as either: Game Changers: Emerging businesses growing quickly with a comparatively smaller audience Leaders: Businesses with a large audience and a fast growth rate Niche Players: New or small companies with smaller audiences and a low growth rate Established Players: Large businesses with loyal, developed audiencesThe small and large dots represent the business’ statistics at various times. Hover over a dot to see a more complete read of the business’ snapshot at that time, including total traffic, organic social traffic, and email traffic.Note where each competitor currently stands. And their recent growth compared to yours. Use this to make a list of the top 5 competitors in your market.Next, click on the “Benchmarking” tab. Then click “Organic Social.” Here, you’ll see how much website traffic competitors drive from their organic social media marketing strategy.For example, we see that Dominos’ organic social media drove higher-than-usual website traffic in November 2023. It’s likely they ran a successful marketing campaign. You could explore their social media posts from that time to gather insights for your own organic social media strategy.Scroll down to see the top social media channels used by each competitor.The graph also shows you a comparison of channel usage compared to the market average.In this example, we see that competitor2.com is limiting their social media to just two channels. And they’re using YouTube a lot more than market average.Use this information to help determine which social media channels you should use for your business.Further reading: How to Perform a Social Media Competitor Analysis in 6 Steps.2. Set Social Media Goals and ObjectivesUse SMART goals as a framework to set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound objectives. Setting SMART goals will ensure your social media marketing efforts are focused and efficient. And that you know how your campaigns perform.A small business doing social media marketing for the first time will likely set different SMART goals than an established, larger company. Their team size, available resources, and budget are different.For example, your newly launched burger restaurant might set a SMART goal to “increase organic Instagram engagement rates by 15% in the next quarter.” Or “increase website traffic from Facebook by 5% in the next two weeks.”3. Get to Know Your Target AudienceA target audience is a group of people you’d like to reach with your social media marketing strategy. It’s usually a group defined by traits like age, gender, income, interests, behaviors, and goals. Understanding your target audience helps create social media marketing campaigns that are likely to resonate and drive engagement. Which means you’re more likely to generate results, faster.The best place to start researching your target audience? Your competitors.Because the target audience for their products is likely similar to yours, you can use the information about their existing audience to help define your own.Here’s how:Use Semrush’s One2Target tool to gather information about audience demographics, socioeconomics, and behavior.Let’s use Nike as an example to see what we can learn about their audience.Open the tool, enter the domain, then click “Analyze.”This generates a comprehensive overview of your competitor’s target audience. The “Demographics” tab shows a breakdown by age, sex, and country.The “Socioeconomics” tab shows the audience’s average household size, household income, employment status, and education level.And the “Behavior” tab tells you audience interests, device types, and most-used social media platforms.Here’s what we can tell about Nike’s audience by looking at the data: They are fairly even split gender-wise (53% female, 47% male) They are between 25 and 34 years old The mostly in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom The majority works full time and ranges between low and middle income Most of them completed high school or college Their favorite social media channels are YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram4. Choose the Right Social Media Platforms for Your BusinessDifferent social media platforms are suited for different types of content.For example, Pinterest is more visual and is predominantly used for home, fashion, and style insights. That’s why there are lots of businesses that use photos to promote their products on the platform.LinkedIn, on the other hand, is tailored toward working professionals. It best supports business content.Consider, too, how each channel matches the demographics of your target market. Different social media platforms attract different audiences. For example, Facebook is popular with men aged 18 to 44. Whereas TikTok is most used by women aged 18-24. If your product or service is aimed at adult men, Facebook is an obvious choice to start your social media marketing campaign.The number of social media platforms you manage depends on your goals and your available resources. Consider your business size, social media budget, and the number of social media managers available to run campaigns. Don’t spread yourself too thin. This makes it difficult to provide great experiences on each platform. As a small business, you might want to focus on one or two channels to start with. And grow from there.Pro tipYour audience won’t follow you on every social media channel. It’s OK to post the same content on TikTok and as an Instagram Reel. Or share the same link on Facebook and LinkedIn.5. Develop a Social Media Content StrategyA social media content strategy is a detailed plan that outlines how you’ll create, publish, and manage content on your social media channels. Creating a strategy gives your social media content direction. And it puts you in a stronger position to achieve your social media goals. This is in contrast to posting social media content on the fly. Which can be stressful, confusing, and time-consuming.Start by listing the platforms you’ve chosen to focus on. Include the content formats available in that channel. A list for Facebook might look like this: Text posts Images Videos Carousels Stories Live video Interactive content (e.g., polls, surveys, and quizzes)Then, consider the different types of social media content you could create. For inspiration, here’s an example of using an image to market a product by shoe company Danner:And software company Slack uses Reels to highlight a new feature:Further reading: 8 Best Social Media Campaigns to Inspire You in 2024To help you decide which types of content to create, find out what performs best in your industry.

This helps small business owners extend their social content to reach people who might be unaware of their brand. And target ads to specific audiences and demographics to increase the chances of engagement.Unlike traditional advertising (e.g., television, print media, or radio), social media advertising is a cost-effective way to scale a business. This makes it ideal for smaller companies on tighter budgets.Use native advertising to create a social media ad. This is when you pay for a regular social media post to appear in other people’s feeds. Like this example on Facebook by Good Protein: We know this is a native advert because it says ‘Sponsored’ in the top-right corner.Social media ads run on a pay-per-click (PPC) model. That means you only pay when a person clicks on your ad.Most social media platforms allow you to target ad content to a precise audience.
