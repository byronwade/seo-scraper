  "content": "What Is Social Media SEO?Social media SEO is optimizing your social media profiles and posts so more people discover your brand in search results. Both on social platforms and search engines.For example, social SEO can help your video rank higher in YouTube results:And Google:Higher rankings can translate into more viewers, social engagements, and followers. And more sales.How Social Media Affects SEOSocial media performance is not a Google ranking factor. Google doesn’t look at social signals (like followers, engagement rates, or shares) when ranking your website content.Some studies show that pages with more social shares tend to rank higher in Google results. Just remember that this is correlation, not causation.But if you want to improve your SEO, social media can benefit you indirectly: Boost branded search: People who find and engage with your brand on social media are more likely to search for your brand on Google Increase organic (unpaid) clicks: People who engage with your content on social media may be more likely to click on your results from Google searches Establish authority: Social media can help you establish authority in your field. Google encourages creators to demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). Generate backlinks: Content that performs well on social media is more likely to be found and linked to. This can lead to backlinks (links on other websites that point to your site) that benefit your rankings. Gather insights: Social media metrics and trends can inform your SEO strategy. For example, you can see which topics your audience likes best. Then write blog posts about them. Drive on-site engagement: Social posts can drive traffic to your website. And the resulting engagements can benefit your SEO—as long as they’re relevant to the topic. Improve local rankings: Gaining followers and positive reviews on social media may help your local business listing rank higher in Google’s map results.Plus, social signals likely play a role in Bing SEO. Their webmaster guidelines warn against trying to artificially affect rankings using social media schemes. Which implies that social signals are at least somewhat important.So, it’s well worth incorporating social media management into your SEO strategy. And applying SEO best practices to your social activity.9 Best Platforms for Social Media SEOSome social media platforms offer better SEO opportunities than others. (For reasons we’ll explore below.)The right platform mix depends on your resources and goals.

YouTubeYouTube is one of the best platforms for social media SEO. Because YouTube videos often rank in Google results.Plus, YouTube’s search function is extremely popular.Let’s look at each factor in detail.YouTube Videos Often Rank in Google ResultsGoogle owns YouTube, so it’s no surprise that YouTube videos often rank in Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs)—the pages that display results after a user enters a search term.On September 25, 2023, over 30% of Google desktop SERPs in the U.S. featured a video carousel, video result, or featured video.
