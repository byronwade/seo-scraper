Organic Research and Domain Overview: SERP Feature Tracking and Revamped Position Changes Two of Semrush’s most popular tools, Organic Research and Domain Overview, received some big upgrades to their data reporting in 2023. Now, Semrush takes into account all search results—not just the classic position results. Ranking in Google isn’t just about getting the top links anymore. SERP features have become incredibly dynamic and often get more attention with their front-and-center placement at the top of search engine results.Before this update, you couldn’t estimate how much traffic a domain gets from a specific SERP feature, making it impossible to build a strategy based on competitors' performance as the potential traffic impact remained unclear.The new update helps you unlock your website’s full search potential with an in-depth analysis of SERP features in addition to traditional organic results. You can track any domain’s presence in up to 38 different types of SERP features, including featured snippets, knowledge panels, carousels, recipes, and more. The Organic Research tool now shows all search results, including SERP features.Another big upgrade is the new Position Changes tab in Organic Research, which makes it quick and easy to get a high-level overview of a website’s traffic trends and position changes. The Position Changes tab got a significant makeover. Now, there are several easy widgets that break down the position changes and trends for any domain you choose.Backlink Analytics’ New Authority Score Is More Accurate Than EverThe Backlink Analytics tool empowers you to analyze both your backlink profiles as well as your competitors’, allowing you to compare multiple domains side by side. Previously, the formula we used to calculate Authority Score was based on two complex algorithms that combined data from organic search, traffic, and backlinks to grade a website’s overall quality. Now, we've improved the clarity, reliability, and consistency of the Authority Score.The new formula puts greater emphasis on organic traffic and common factors that indicate link spam, creating the most robust defense against manipulation possible. The result is the most data-driven analytics score on the market, helping to improve insights into your website authority.The Backlinks Analytics tool has a revamped Authority Score with added depth. The Authority Score widget can be located within the “Overview” tab of the tool on the left-hand side. Position Tracking: New Summary Widget with Automatic Generated Text Insights and Bing Tracking Position Tracking (also called rank tracking or SERP tracking) lets you track a website’s daily rankings for a custom set of target keywords. Position Tracking comes with tons of reports, tables with data, graphs, and more. However, we know that some users have found it hard to gain insights from so much data. Not anymore! In 2023, we added a widget called “Summary” to the Position Tracking Landscape report. This new widget provides a short text summary of the latest changes for the main website you’re tracking (either your site or an added competitor). It includes insights, such as: The keywords gained or lost in various topics for the primary domain Traffic growth for certain pages Changes in a competitor’s Share of Voice or Visibility Information about potential competitors and changes in their metrics… and many more. The new “Summary” widget is in the Landscape report in the Position Tracking tool. The widget is the top widget on the right.With Bing’s rising popularity over the last year, we decided to add it as a search engine Position Tracking for improved performance tracking.Along with classic tracking, we also track Bing AI SERP Features and their presence in Bing’s search results. These features are: AI Summary AI Stories Ask AI AI ChatThe addition of Bing is just one of many ways we are trying to improve Semrush to fit your needs.

It provides a list of issues, making it easy to see precisely where a website is struggling.With search engine bots, especially Googlebot, now rendering JavaScript (JS) during website crawls, it's essential to know what your content looks like to visitors when they arrive on your web pages. JavaScript issues can inadvertently be impacting your page titles, description, links, and other elements on your website.In early 2023, we integrated the capability to render JavaScript pages in Site Audit crawls. Alongside this feature, we also introduced a comprehensive JS Impact report.

Get More People to Your Door with Local SEO UpdatesA robust local SEO strategy enhances online visibility within specific geographic areas, allowing businesses to connect with potential customers in their vicinity by appearing more prominently in local search results, local packs, and map listings.Optimizing for local search terms not only increases the chances of attracting nearby customers actively searching for relevant products or services but also fosters trust and credibility within the local community.
