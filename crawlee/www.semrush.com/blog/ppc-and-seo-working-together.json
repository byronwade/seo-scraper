  "content": "Both pay-per-click (PPC) and search engine optimization (SEO) marketing strategies help boost your brand’s visibility and drive traffic to your website. So, marketers tend to focus on one or the other.But SEO and PPC actually work better together. Here’s how. How PPC and SEO Work TogetherPPC ads drive immediate, targeted traffic to your website. And can reach customers who are close to or ready to buy. You control your ad budget and bids, and target specific demographics, locations, devices, and times of the day.Although PPC offers nearly instant visibility in search results, your ad traffic is only going to last for as long as you pay for it. This is where SEO complements PPC.SEO focuses more on long-term gains and generating sustainable, free traffic. By creating quality content that ranks well on search engines. As well as helping users and guiding them along the marketing funnel. Further reading: SEO vs. PPC: What the Differences Are & When to Use EachImproved Visibility in Search ResultsThe more search engine results page (SERP) “real estate” you inhabit, the more visible your brand is to users. This helps you build greater credibility in the eyes of readers. And drive more clicks.Instead of reaching just one position on the first page, you target multiple when using PPC and SEO. This can include a paid ad spot, organic spots (including featured snippets), and even video and image results.By targeting relevant keywords in SEO content and then using PPC to also bid on those and related keywords, you can capture a greater market share and expand your brand’s reach. Pro tipAfter your PPC ads and SEO content go live, monitor your rankings with the Position Tracking tool. A Consistent Brand Experience for Users PPC and SEO work together to create a stronger, more recognizable online presence. One that helps users get to know your brand’s products or services. And its overall vibe. This helps build trust in your brand, which influences purchasing decisions.For example, retargeted PPC ads keep your brand top of mind. And optimizing those ad landing pages with similar keywords, topics, and relevant internal links reinforce the key info you want users to remember about your business. Like using a special product material or offering certain discounts.NoteAs an incentive to create relevant, top-notch ads, Google rewards users who land high Google Quality Scores with lower costs-per-click (CPCs). Both ad relevance and a user’s landing page experience factor into the rating—highlighting why using PPC and SEO together is beneficial.Further reading: What is Retargeting and How Does It Work?Access to More User Behavior DataBy using both PPC and SEO, you have two user data sources instead of one. Giving you a better understanding of your consumer base.So, you can make smarter marketing decisions that allow you to successfully connect with users and reach your goals.There’s a reciprocal relationship between PPC and SEO—one feeds the other.For instance, as users click on your PPC ads, you gain real-time insights into the effectiveness of keywords and ad copy. And you gather concrete knowledge on what works (or doesn’t) from A/B tests, where you run different ad variations to compare their performance.This information then guides your SEO decisions, helping you figure out things like: What factors cause users to convert (i.e., taking the action you want them to take, like buying a product or filling out a form) Which keywords and messaging drive the most traffic Where users go after landing on your websiteImage Source: AdalysisAs a hypothetical example, consider a brand that sells hiking shoes. The company optimized its pillar page for “durable hiking shoes” and “rugged hiking shoes.” But it isn’t ranking for them in search. However, its PPC data shows that targeting the keyword “waterproof hiking shoes” resulted in significant web traffic.Given the PPC success for “waterproof hiking shoes,” it would make sense to create new content centering on that phrase instead to improve the odds of attracting and converting more users. Use your SEO analytics to similarly inform your PPC campaigns. Like the keywords users search before landing on your site, the number of visits to different webpages, and average ranking position. To find these metrics and keywords driving traffic to your website, use Semrush’s Organic Traffic Insights.First, follow the project configuration guide to set up the tool. When you’re done and you’ve connected your Google account, you’ll see an organic traffic report with data from Google Search Console, Google Analytics, and Semrush. Here, you’ll see an overview of your website traffic. Along with details on how different keywords contribute to those visits. To see the full keyword list for a specific page, click the hyperlinked number (“129” in this example) next to the landing page you want to analyze.Here, you can filter the keywords by: Position Volume Keyword difficulty Traffic shareBetter Budget and Time ManagementWhen SEO and PPC are working together, you don’t need to spend as much on PPC.Because you’re using a second channel that also brings in traffic—one that doesn’t need you to continuously pay for it. Which makes this duo more budget friendly.Using both SEO and PPC helps you make the most of the money and time you’re investing. The work you put into each one strengthens the other. And they often benefit from similar approaches.For example, use the Keyword Magic Tool to find and sort keywords by ranking difficulty and search intent to capture ones that work for both SEO and PPC. How to Successfully Use PPC and SEO TogetherPPC and SEO bring the best of both worlds: immediate traffic and a long-term organic presence. Using both strategies helps you leverage the strengths of each. While overcoming the limitations of using one over the other. Here’s how to unify them:Create a Cohesive Keyword StrategyA/B test different ads in your PPC campaigns to see how well certain keywords and messages convert users. Use your findings to shape your SEO keyword strategy, creating thoughtful keyword clusters.Start with the Advertising Research Tool to discover keywords your competitors are bidding on and see real examples of their campaign ads. Enter a competitor’s domain and click “Search.”A dashboard will pop up and automatically show you info from the “Positions” tab. Like changes in the domain’s ranking keywords, traffic, and the estimated cost of the traffic.Scroll down below the “Paid Search Trends” chart to see a list of all the keywords the brand is bidding on. Along with their ad position, volume, cost-per-click, and landing page URL. Look for relevant keywords that fit your budget and that you haven’t targeted yet. Also, click on the “Ads Copies” tab to see the different ads your competitor is running. Including how many keywords they’ve incorporated. Leverage Data to Strengthen Your PPC and SEO EffortsPPC and SEO data points help you improve your efforts in both areas. And in other marketing avenues, like email campaigns and social media. Use the data to either support the direction of the work you're doing. Or as evidence for the need to adjust.PPC and SEO Performance DataHere are key metrics relevant to both channels that’ll help you objectively measure PPC and SEO performance: Impressions: SEO: How many times your webpage appears in search results PPC: How many times your ad is displayed to users Click-through rates (CTRs): SEO: The percentage of users who click on your listing in search results after seeing it PPC: The percentage of users who click on your ad after seeing it Conversions: SEO: How many times visitors complete a desired action on your website (e.g., filling out a form, downloading an ebook, or buying something) after arriving from organic search results PPC: How many times users completed a desired action on your website after clicking on your ad Conversion rates: SEO: The percentage of visitors who complete a desired action on your website after arriving from organic search results PPC: The percentage of clicks on your ad that result in a conversion Using PPC Data to Shape SEOBoost your SEO content by applying these insights from your PPC campaigns: High-performing keywords: Identify which PPC keywords drive the most traffic.
