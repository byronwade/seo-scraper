More Businesses Will Invest in Nano- or Micro-Influencer MarketingInfluencer marketing is when brands collaborate with individuals who have a dedicated online following (i.e., influencers) to promote products. Brands rely on influencers’ credibility and follower trust to drive consumer interest.In 2024, brands were more likely to collaborate with nano- and micro-influencers (i.e., influencers with up to 100,000 followers) over macro-influencers and celebrities (influencers with 100,000 to over 1 million followers).Because nano- and micro- influencers typically charge less than influencers with more followers. But still generate high engagement rates.Nano-influencers get an average engagement rate of 4.59%. Which is the highest of all influencer groups.Micro-influencers have an engagement rate of 2.59%. Followed by mid-tier influencers at 1.71%.Macro-influencers engage their followers less on average with an engagement rate of 1.44%.Pro tipIncrease the odds of achieving a positive return on investment (ROI) with your influencer marketing campaigns by collaborating with influencers whose followers belong to your target audience.Find the right influencers for your brand with Influencer Analytics.Tell the tool what kind of influencer you want. And hit “Create magic.”For example, we entered “pet influencer with a small female audience.”And got a list with over 17,000 influencer accounts.Go through the list. And find influencers whose followers are also members of your target audience. And are within your budget range.Further reading: How to Find Influencers for Your Brand (Not Just on Instagram)4. Marketers Will Continue to Build Trust with User-Generated ContentUser-generated content (UGC) is content created by individuals and consumers. Businesses can repurpose it on social media, in email marketing campaigns, or on a website or landing page. Think of user-generated content as word-of-mouth recommendations. Because it reflects the opinions and views of your real-world customers.Only 30% of consumers say they are able to highly trust companies.Meanwhile, 72% of consumers say customer reviews influence their purchase decisions. And 40% say customer-generated images and videos also influence their decision to buy.Which is probably why many brands use UGC to build trust and authentic relationships with their target audience.Here are six ways you can generate UGC from your audience and existing customers: Look at customer reviews and testimonials on Google reviews, social media, or conversations between customers and your support team and turn them into social media posts Search for brand and product mentions across the web using the Media Monitoring app to find stories that people share about your products. And share those stories on social media or on your blog Engage with communities on social media or forums like Reddit to encourage users to share more about their experiences with your brand Create a brand hashtag, like Nike’s #JustDoIt or Coke’s #ShareACoke, and encourage your audience to use that hashtag when they create posts related to your product Use your purchase confirmation email or page to ask customers to create a photo, video, or leave a review Host a social media raffle to encourage customers to tag your account in a testimonial post for your product or serviceFor example, this is an Instagram post by skincare brand Blume featuring an image created by one of their happy customers, showing the efficacy of their product.The post got a lot of engagement (over a thousand likes and hundreds of comments) which signals that their followers are interested in this type of content.5. Marketers Will Use More Short-Form Videos in Social Media Ad CampaignsIn 2024, spending on short-form videos for advertising was estimated to reach almost $100 billion.That’s likely because short-form videos are generally more engaging. And are highly shareable.Videos under 60 seconds have a 50% average engagement rate. While videos longer than 60 minutes have a 16% average engagement rate.This signals an opportunity for marketers to reach more people. With paid social campaigns and product ads using TikTok or YouTube Shorts.Find inspiration for short-form video topics using the Keyword Analytics for YouTube app.Open the tool and click “Get started” under “Keywords Research.”Then, enter a keyword related to your brand, industry, or market in the search bar and click “Search.”You’ll see a list of related terms and relevant information, including the top videos.Look for keywords with a high search volume and a low competitive rate. Then, target them using short-form video content.6. Brands Will Use Values-Driven Marketing to Show Commitment to Environmental or Societal CausesConsumers often prefer brands that share their values.In fact, 78% of consumers said they made a purchase decision based on a brand’s values. And 55% said they are much more likely to buy from companies that reflect their beliefs.And more than 80% of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainably sourced and produced goods.This means brands can benefit from using values-driven marketing to resonate better with potential customers and foster loyalty among their target market.Here are examples of values-driven marketing in action:Ecologyst shows its commitment to sustainability by creating an Instagram Story highlight about its sustainability efforts.And Adidas’ “Breaking Barriers” campaign highlights its commitment to improving access to sports for women and girls in Europe. 7. Social Commerce Will Drive Greater Conversions for Ecommerce BrandsSocial commerce is the process of selling products directly on social media. It creates a seamless, convenient, and interactive shopping experience. Platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube integrate shopping features directly into their platforms. Meaning people can purchase products without having to leave social media.This ensures users stay on the platform through the entire journey—from product discovery to checkout. Which can lower the risk of cart abandonment.The best part?Social commerce accounted for 18.5% of online sales in 2023. And is predicted to be a $100 billion industry by 2025 because of its ease of use and frictionless checkout. Image Source: eMarketerIn practice, social commerce can mean partnering with influencers to create engaging, short-form videos. Your target audience can then interact with these videos to purchase featured products in a few clicks.It can also mean integrating shoppable products into carousel ads to drive purchases from your social media posts.8. Marketers Will Focus on Creating Personalized Content with AIMarketers who created personalized customer experiences were 215% more likely to say their strategies in 2023 were successful.And 77% of marketers who used generative AI said it helped with creating personalized content.For example, AI-powered tools like Peak can accurately segment audiences. Which allows marketers to analyze their users’ habits and preferences. And craft highly relevant emails, blog posts, or social ads.And ContentShake AI uses Semrush’s SEO data to craft content that targets keywords your audience is searching for.Even chatbots are evolving. Conversational chatbots like Drift use AI to offer instant, personalized recommendations during customer interactions. Making the experience feel more tailored.As AI tools become more sophisticated, personalized content will continue to be a key strategy in improving customer experiences and driving business growth.Pro tipUse Market Explorer to learn more about your target audience’s demographics, socioeconomics, interests, and more. So you can create content they’re interested in. 9. Marketers Will Increase Focus on First-Party DataIn light of growing privacy concerns and shifting regulations, marketers are increasingly prioritizing first-party data over third-party data to drive their marketing campaigns.But what are first-party and third-party data? First-party data is data that you collect directly from your users through interactions like website visits, purchases, and signups. This information is stored within your organization and is rarely shared with external parties. Third-party data, on the other hand, is data you obtain from external organizations (usually data brokers) that collect and aggregate data from multiple sources. In some cases, users don’t consent to their information being shared. One of the biggest drivers behind the shift to first-party data is the growing consumer demand for privacy.Around a third of consumers said they care about their data privacy and want more control over their personal data. These consumers are also willing to take action or have already taken action to protect their online data.In addition to that, more governments have introduced stricter privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU. And the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).This growing demand for privacy has marketers turning away from relying on third-party data. Only 49% of marketers still rely on third-party data, down from 75% in 2022.Here are some ways you can collect first-party data: Track website analytics. Use Google Analytics to track audience behavior on your website. Collect data on page views, click-through rates, and user journeys to understand customer interests and preferences. Collect customer feedback. Gather feedback through satisfaction surveys, product reviews, and customer support interactions. Build loyalty programs. Use loyalty programs that collect data on customer purchase history, frequency, and preferences. Use this data to reward and engage loyal customers. Deploy sign-up forms. Encourage your audience to sign up for newsletters or register for webinars. Then, collect information such as email addresses, job titles, and preferences.
