And optimizes your advertising budget and conversion rates.

Google will notify you via email and the campaign platform once your ad is approved and live.Best Practices for an Effective Google Ads CampaignBelow, we’ll cover some best practices. So you’ll learn how to launch Google ads in a way that maximizes your campaign performance.Target the Right KeywordsKeywords are the words or phrases that users type into Google. Your ads will be displayed to people searching for those terms (if you’re running a Google paid search campaign). Choosing the right keywords is essential because it determines whether your ads will be shown to the right audience—people who are actually interested in your products or services.For example, if you sell car insurance packages, relevant keywords could be “car insurance,” “car insurance quotes,” and “best car insurance.”Use Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to find your target keywords. Input a broad, relevant search term into the tool and click “Search.”The tool will present a list of relevant keywords along with important metrics like: Search volume: The number of times a keyword is searched Keyword difficulty: How difficult it will be to target the keyword compared with competitors Search intent: The motivation behind the search Cost per click (CPC): Estimated amount you’ll pay for each click on your selected keywords Look for keywords with high enough search volume to reach a wide audience, low enough keyword difficulty to optimize your spend, the right intent to serve your business needs, and a CPC that fits within your advertising budget. For example, if brand awareness is your focus, target keywords that have “Transactional (T)” or “Commercial Investigation (C)” search intent. These signify that a user is looking to find relevant companies rather than just gather information. Regularly review and update your keyword list based on the performance of your campaign. Test variations to ensure you get maximum value out of your campaigns.Optimize Ad CopyYour ads should grab the attention of potential customers. Start with your headline—the first thing users see. Include strong calls-to-action (CTAs) like “Buy Now” “Sign Up,” or “Get a Free Quote” to encourage an immediate response. In the description, highlight the benefits of your product or service. Use words that evoke emotion, speak directly to your target buyer, and keep it simple. The user should be able to quickly and easily understand what the ad is about and what action they should take next.For example, take a look at the auto insurance ad below. It starts with the direct headline \"Get Auto Insurance Quotes,\" which motivates users to take quick action. Below the headline, there is a description that provides a clear incentive for users to engage with the ad.Test different versions of your ad copy to see which lead to more clicks and conversions. Focus on varying one element at a time, such as the headline or description.Structure Your CampaignsGroup your campaigns based on your products or services. For example, if you sell insurance, create a separate campaign for “car insurance,” “health insurance,” and “travel insurance.”Within each campaign, set up different ad groups for each product or service within that category.For instance, under the “car insurance” campaign, you could have ad groups for “comprehensive car insurance,” “collision coverage car insurance,” and “new car replacement coverage.”Each ad group will contain a set of closely related keywords. For example, the “comprehensive car insurance” ad group could include keywords like: Comprehensive car insurance quotes Best comprehensive car insurance Affordable comprehensive car insuranceThis ad group structure allows you to create hyper-relevant ad copy and landing page content tailored to each product.This logical campaign → ad group → keywords → ad copy structure is key to driving qualified traffic and maximizing ROI from your Google Ads campaigns.Optimize Landing Pages for ConversionsYour landing pages (where the ads drive users to) are where the conversion action takes place—whether it's a purchase, lead form submission, or another valuable event. Follow these best practices to optimize landing pages for maximum conversions: Ensure consistency with ad copy. Your landing page should reflect the message and offers in your ad copy. So users know they’re in the right place. Simplify the design. A cluttered page can distract users from taking your desired action. Use a clean, straightforward design with ample white space to focus attention on the important elements, like the call to action and the benefits of your product or service. Optimize page speed. Slow-loading pages can lead to high bounce rates. Ensure your landing pages load quickly by optimizing images, reducing server response times, and minimizing the use of heavy scripts that can slow down the page. Use high-quality visuals. Incorporate relevant images or videos that complement your message and enhance the visitor's experience. Visuals should be purposeful, helping to illustrate product benefits or demonstrate how a service works. Include trust signals. Add elements that build trust, such as testimonials, customer reviews, case studies, or trust badges (like security certifications). These can reassure visitors and enhance your credibility. Minimize form fields. If your landing page has a form, keep it as short as possible. Request only the essential information you need from visitors to reduce friction and increase the likelihood of completion.Leverage Negative KeywordsNegative keywords are words or phrases you choose to prevent your ads from being triggered by queries unrelated to your business.Saving you money by reducing irrelevant clicks that will never convert. In our car insurance example, “boat insurance” and “RV insurance” could be ideal negative keywords if you don’t offer those services. To add negative keywords, sign in to your Google Ads account.Then navigate to Campaigns > Insights and reports > Search terms report.This will show you every search query that triggered your ads, along with metrics like impressions, clicks, costs, etc.Carefully scan the list of search queries to find and capture irrelevant terms.Now, go inside the relevant ad group and click on the “Negative search keywords” tab.Click the plus button and add your keywords.Regularly review your search terms report to ensure your negative keywords list is optimized. To save you money. And increase your campaign’s ROI. Research Competitor Ad StrategiesCompetitor research should be a key part of your Google Ads campaign strategy. Because you can see what’s working for them (or not) and use that info to outpace them. Semrush's Advertising Research tool is perfect for this task. Open the tool, enter your competitor’s website, and click “Search.”You’ll see a lot of information here. Including number of keywords, target keywords list, total traffic from those paid keywords, and CPC. Analyze the report to see if you’re missing any important keywords. And add them to your campaign.Now, go to the “Ads Copies” tab to view the actual ads your competitor is running. Review the messaging and CTAs to identify areas for your ads to improve. Click on the headline to view their landing page.Analyze the design, layout, and content for ideas for your landing pages. Leverage A/B TestingA/B testing, also known as split testing, involves comparing two versions of an element (like an ad) to see which one performs better. It’s a powerful strategy that can help improve the performance of your Google PPC campaigns. Here’s how to leverage it for your campaign:First, identify the specific element you want to test. Like the headline, call-to-action, or description. Your goal is to prove a hypothesis, such as “longer headlines work better than shorter headlines for my product.”Create two versions of your ad—one with the original element (A) and one with the changed element (B). Focus on changing just one element to either prove or disprove your hypothesis.Then, run both versions of your ad simultaneously. Google Ads will randomly show one of the two ads to your target audience.Analyze the results. Look at key metrics like click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, and cost per conversion.If version B performs better than version A, consider making B your new default ad. Or vice versa.By leveraging A/B testing, you can make data-driven decisions and continuously improve the effectiveness of your Google Ads campaign.Launch Your First Google Ads Campaign TodayYou now have enough understanding of how to run a successful campaign in Google ads.This is your chance to apply what you’ve learned.
