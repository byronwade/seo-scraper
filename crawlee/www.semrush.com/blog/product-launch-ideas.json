Contributing to increased market share and sustained business growth.Here are 15 creative marketing ideas for launching your new product:1. Influencer PartnershipsPartnering with influencers helps you reach their audiences and gain the audience’s trust.Many influencers have a sizable and/or engaged following. Some of them are also great at content creation. This helps them showcase products in a unique and appealing way. And connect with their followers.This can help you reach a broader audience through collaboration.Now, you might wonder how to find an influencer whose audience overlaps with your target audience.Using a specialized tool like Influencer Analytics can be highly effective in finding the right people to work with.It helps you search for influencers by channel or keyword. And view their metrics.Here’s how you can use it to find the right influencers for your needs:Let’s say you run an Instagram account and would like to find creators and celebrities to promote your products.Start by going to “Influencer Discovery” and selecting “Instagram.”Click “Filters” in the top-right corner.Then set your preferences for subscriber count, category, pricing, engagement rate, etc.You’ll see a list of results based on your criteria.You can click on each influencer’s profile to access more data and contact information.Example: Daniel Wellington’s Influencer Marketing StrategyDaniel Wellington achieved a global presence and boosted sales through successful influencer collaborations.Wellington executed a brilliant strategy by focusing on Instagram (micro-)influencers.

Launch EventsA launch event is a strategic and carefully orchestrated occasion that introduces a new product or service to the market.It allows you to showcase your product in a controlled and curated environment. And it’s a prime chance to connect with customers, partners, influencers, and the press personally and interactively. This can generate buzz, media coverage, and boost brand awareness.

Give them a press kit that includes high-quality images, product information, and key messages about your brand.Another option is to use social media to amplify your event. This could include live-streaming the event, creating a unique hashtag, or running a contest tied to the event.Example: Slack’s Launch EventSlack took a unique approach to its launch event strategy. Instead of a one-time event, they chose to do it in phases over a few months. Starting with a private beta release (or “limited preview release” as they called it).This allowed for iterative improvements and built a strong user community.When the public launch came, Slack had enthusiastic supporters. And established a strong market presence, leading to significant growth.3. Social Media ContestsSocial media contests are online competitions on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter).They can take various forms.
