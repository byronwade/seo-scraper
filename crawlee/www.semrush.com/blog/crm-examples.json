  "content": "Customer relationship management (CRM) tools allow businesses to manage and track interactions with customers across all their platforms. These platforms have evolved over the years and now cover a range of features. We’ll dive into some CRM examples to better understand how these tools actually help businesses. Whether you work at a growing startup, a brick-and-mortar business, or an enterprise company, these CRM software examples will set you on the right track.Let’s get into it.What Is Customer Relationship Management (CRM)?Customer relationship management refers to the process of tracking and handling all interactions between a business and its customers.This is most commonly used to refer to CRM tools that carry out a range of functions normally conducted manually or through multiple spreadsheets and databases. You can track forms, emails, text messages, social posts, quotes, and even purchases in one location using the platform. Customers used to go through only a few steps to complete a purchase. But there are many more avenues to a buyer’s journey in the digital era. CRMs capture the entirety of this journey, data and all, while automating much of the communication process. Essentially, it’s managing the relationship between your business and your customers’. Why Is CRM Software Important? CRM software is important because it allows you to streamline your sales, marketing, customer service, and accounting efforts by moving relevant data into the same platform.This has a positive impact on your business from two main perspectives. You can: Improve current customer relationships Develop strategies to bring in in new customersCRM tools accomplish this by giving businesses a 360-degree view of potential and existing customers as they move through their relationship with the business. In other words, they give businesses the ability to see how customers respond to sales and marketing efforts. Allowing for real-time adjustments that lower costs and increase revenue.CRMs also provide a single source of information to track relationships between your business and each individual customer. That means more transparency and efficient communication between internal teams. All of these beneficial features add up to a comprehensive platform that helps businesses save money, keep customers, and bring in more business.Main Benefits of a CRM PlatformSo, you know that CRM platforms help businesses plan, manage, and track all interactions between brands and customers to provide them with a better overall experience. Now let’s take a look at some of their main benefits: 1. 360-View of Customer ExperienceYour business interacts with customers across numerous digital marketing channels—from social media and SMS messaging to search engines and websites. CRM platforms let you easily track and interact with customers as they move from channel to channel. This is known as a 360-view of the customer. 2. AutomationsOne of the most notable benefits of CRM platforms is that they let marketing, sales, and other departments offload the manual tasks that take up more and more time as businesses grow. Whether it’s sending out automated email responses or automatically sorting and segmenting leads based on their online behavior, CRM automation greatly improves the efficiency of marketing and sales efforts. 3. Personalized Customer ExperiencesCustomers want to have a more personalized connection with the businesses they buy from: around 80% of survey respondents want a personalized experience from retailers. CRMs give businesses the flexibility to craft specific marketing materials for each and every customer; you can sort your leads based on which messaging they respond to, craft more personalized content using templates, and schedule follow ups based on their behavior.4. Data AlignmentCRMs provide a single source of truth for all customer-related data. This means regardless of the department or team you’re on, you will see the same information about existing and potential customers. This seems straightforward, but many companies struggle to keep data aligned, especially as they grow and take on more customers. Instead of having distinct data hubs that are prone to error, CRMs store all data in a single location, so everyone is working off accurate information. 5. Data Tracking and SecurityNot only do CRMs keep data aligned, but they also ensure that data is updated regularly while restricting access on a need-to-know basis. Updating customer data manually means more opportunities for error and giving more people access to key insights about your target audience. CRMs automatically update customer profiles based on their actions and let you keep this information password protected. Okay, now that we’ve gone over some of the main benefits of these platforms, let’s look at some examples of CRMs commonly used by businesses.Examples of CRM Tools in ActionThere are tons of CRM platforms out there that businesses can use depending on their size, industry, and specific needs.
