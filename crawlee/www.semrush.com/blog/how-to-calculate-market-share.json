  "content": "What Is Market Share?Market share is the percentage of a particular market served by a particular company. It indicates how dominant the company is in its niche and what potential it has for growth.More specifically, market share usually refers to revenue market share. (The portion of total industry revenue attributed to a company.)For example, a company that generates half of its industry’s revenue has a 50% market share.But you can also measure your market share of specific metrics like: Monthly active users Website traffic Unit salesAnalyses are always based on a certain time scale (e.g., the last financial year). And can also be restricted based on geographic areas, consumer demographics, etc.It all depends on what's useful for your analysis.What Is Relative Market Share?Relative market share shows what proportion of the market you serve compared to your strongest rival. It helps you understand your competitive standing.For example, if you generate half as much revenue as the industry leader, your relative market share is 50%. As with standard market share, you can calculate your relative market share of different metrics, for different time ranges, and for different segments.What Is the Market Share Formula?The standard market share formula is:Market share percentage = (company revenue / market revenue) x 100Let’s say the U.S. smartphone industry generated $80 billion of revenue last year.If Apple generated $40 billion of those sales, it had 50% market share—(40 billion / 80 billion) x 100 = 50.To make market share calculations of specific metrics, use this formula:Market share percentage of metric = (company metric / market metric) x 100Let’s say the smartphone industry made 1.2 billion shipments last year.If Apple made 240 million of those shipments, it had 20% market share—(240 million / 1.2 billion) x 100 = 20.And this is the relative market share formula: Relative market share percentage = (company market share / strongest competitor’s market share) x 100Let’s say Apple is the market leader with a 25% market share. And its biggest competitor is Samsung, with a 20% market share. Apple’s relative market share is 125%—(25 / 20) x 100). This means they’re the market leader. And their market share is 25% larger than their strongest competitor’s. Samsung’s relative market share is 80%—(20 / 25) x 100). Their market share is 20% smaller than their biggest competitor’s.How to Calculate Market ShareTo determine market share, you need to divide your company metric (e.g., revenue) by the equivalent market metric. Then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.But what data should you use? And where can you find it?Let’s explain how to calculate market share of different values step by step. We’ll also share a free template you can use.TipIf you want to calculate your share of online traffic, visit the next section for the quickest method.1. Source Market DataThe market share calculations you can make are typically limited by the market data available. So, we recommend that you collect market data first. And work from there.Potential sources include market research tools, databases, and industry reports.A Google search like this can help you find the data you’re interested in:If you can’t find data for your niche, try collating it yourself.For example, you can download your competitors’ financial reports. Then, combine their revenue figures with your own to get a market revenue estimate.Market revenue estimate = your revenue + competitors’ revenueSame goes for other metrics, like unit sales.The more competitors you collect data from, the more accurate your market share calculation will be.2. Collect Equivalent Company DataOnce you’ve collected your market data, you need to collect the equivalent data from your company.For example, market revenue and your company’s revenue should relate to the same time range and geographic location. If you don’t use like-for-like data in your market share calculations, you won’t get a valid result.3. Apply the Market Share FormulaAll that’s left is to use your data in the market share formula for your chosen metric.As a reminder, it looks like this:Market share percentage of a metric = (company metric / market metric) x 100If you want to make sure you get things right, make a copy of our market share calculator in Google Sheets.Simply input your market and company data in the upper table.Or fill out the lower table with your own and your competitors’ data. This allows you to calculate a market data estimate and see each company’s market share.(We’ve provided enough space for nine competitors, but you can add or delete rows if necessary. Just make sure to adjust the formulas accordingly.)How to Calculate Traffic ShareTraffic share (or web traffic share) represents the portion of visits that go to your website out of all the website visits made in your industry. This helps you understand how strong your business’s online presence is.And with Semrush’s Market Explorer tool, you can calculate your traffic share in seconds.Just click “Find Competitors,” choose your location, and enter your domain.Then, click “Research a market.”The tool will identify your biggest traffic competitors and conduct a market analysis. (Based on the time scale and location selected at the top.)Go to “All Domains” to see your own and your competitors’ share of traffic:Or go to “Benchmarking” and choose up to five domains to compare.In the table, you can see each acquisition channels’ share of traffic: Total: Visits from any channel Direct: Visits made when users type the URL into a browser or use a bookmark Referral: Visits from links on external domains Organic Search: Visits from unpaid search engine links Paid Search: Visits from search engine advertisements Organic Social: Visits from unpaid social media links Paid Social: Visits from social media advertisements Email: Visits from email links Display Ads: Visits from display advertisements (e.g., banner ads)If your market share is low in a particular area, it suggests you’re missing out on potential traffic. So, you might want to revisit your marketing strategy.For example, if you have a relatively small traffic share in organic search, consider investing more in search engine optimization (SEO).Market Explorer (and your Semrush .Trends subscription) also gives you access to a variety of other insights.

To contribute to a higher share of sales.You can find opportunities with Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool.Enter your domain and a competitor’s domain.Then, choose your country and click “Compare.”Scroll down to the keyword table and click the “Weak” tab. This shows keywords that the competitor outranks you for.You can see both of your positions in the table. It’s a good idea to prioritize keywords that: You already have a high ranking for (so you have fewer positions to gain) Have a high search volume (so the potential traffic gains are higher) Have with a low difficulty score (this suggests it’ll be easier to improve your ranking)Check out our guide for detailed advice on improving your Google rankings.Use a Competitive Pricing StrategyPricing is often one of the main factors in buying decisions. Especially when it comes to products that are available from multiple stores.If you reassure customers that you’re never beaten on price (like Best Buy does), you may be more likely to secure sales.You’ll just need to make sure that this approach works for your brand identity—and your financial model.If you can’t commit to permanently lower prices, try enticing customers with special offers and sales.Once you have the customer on your books, they may be more likely to buy again.

Or what makes you special.Some key elements of Apple’s USP include: Design excellence User-friendly interfaces Emphasis on privacy and securityCreating and communicating a strong value proposition gives customers a reason to choose your brand. So, it can play a key role in increasing your market share.Be InnovativeWhether it’s introducing new product features or bringing a new service to the market, innovations can help your business stand out from the crowd.
