  "content": "What Is an Analytics Dashboard?An analytics dashboard displays real-time performance metrics for a website, department, or project—usually in the form of interactive charts.For example, Google Analytics allows you to build web analytics dashboards that visualize website traffic, conversion rates, etc.Like this: The Semrush Single Project Dashboard, on the other hand, shows you domain analytics, keyword positions, backlink metrics, site health, and on-page SEO suggestions.Users can click each part of the dashboard to access more in-depth reports.Why Use Analytics Dashboards?Analytics dashboards make it quick and easy to understand real-time business performance in a particular area (e.g., digital marketing). This means stakeholders can track progress toward goals without having to dig through lots of data. Or ask colleagues for custom reports.Plus, teams can identify performance issues (and take action) more quickly.Let’s say two websites experience a sudden traffic drop due to a technical issue: Website A monitors a website analytics dashboard daily. They quickly notice and investigate the traffic drop. So, they fix the issue before it causes much harm. Website B only checks traffic metrics at a monthly reporting meeting. They don’t notice and address the traffic drop until four weeks later. After they’ve lost lots of potential sales.In addition to real-time performance monitoring, analytic dashboards also help with creating in-depth reports.Reports document performance over a certain time period. They assist with record-keeping and allow more “hands-off” stakeholders to get regular updates.Plus, there’s scope to go in-depth and include information from other sources (e.g., competitor analysis). That’s why reports beat dashboard analytics for long-term planning.TipHead to My Reports in Semrush to create automated marketing reports every day, week, or month. You can combine data from Semrush, Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Google Business Profile, and more.How to Create a Data Analytics DashboardHere’s how to create an analytics dashboard, step by step:1. Define the Dashboard’s PurposeFirst, define the purpose of the analytics dashboard.You’ll need to consider who will use the dashboard and what questions it should answer.For example, your marketing team might want to create an SEO dashboard that answers: Which search queries do we rank for in Google? How much organic traffic (unpaid search engine traffic) do these rankings drive? What percentage of organic visitors take a desired action (e.g., make a purchase)?Ensure your dashboard’s scope isn’t too broad, or it will become bloated and difficult to navigate.The right choice depends on your business’s size and goals.2. Choose What Metrics to IncludeWhat data to include in an analytics dashboard depends on the purpose of your dashboard.Here are some of the most common types of analytics dashboards and metrics they typically include: Analytics Dashboard Type Commonly Used Metrics Website/web Website traffic, conversion rate, bounce rate Digital marketing Blog traffic, average time on page, email open rate SEO Keyword rankings, organic traffic, backlinks PPC Click-through rate, impressions, cost per click Social media Followers, impressions, engagement rate Ecommerce Average order value, cart abandonment rate, unique visitors B2B sales Sales revenue, average deal size, lead response time Product Churn rate, daily active users, customer lifetime value Customer service Ticket volume, average response time, customer satisfaction score Financial Monthly recurring revenue, gross profit, net profit In the next section, we’ll explain where to find these metrics.3. Identify Data SourcesNext, work out where to collect the raw data you need.If you’re creating a web analytics dashboard, your content management system (CMS) might have analytics built in.For example, Shopify (an ecommerce platform) has an Analytics page that allows users to track metrics like total sales and average order value.Image source: DaasityAlternatively, you can set up GA4. Or a Google Analytics alternative like Clicky, Mixpanel, or Fathom Analytics.You’ll need to create an account and install a tracking code on your site.Other common sources for data analytics dashboards include: Digital marketing tools like Semrush Customer relationship management (CRM) tools like HubSpot and Salesforce Internal databases and spreadsheets Financial systems like QuickBooks and Xero Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn Email marketing platforms like Mailchimp4. Choose a Dashboard Creation ToolNext, decide where to create your data analysis dashboard.Many analytics platforms (or tools with analytical features) have built-in, customizable dashboards. And some offer integrations that let you import data from elsewhere.For example, project dashboards in Semrush display data from various tools.And you can add or remove widgets as you please.You can also collect real-time data from GA4 and Google Search Console.So, make sure to check functionality in the tools you use to collect data. (And take these features into account when you’re next comparing tools.)Alternatively, use a data visualization platform.Data visualization platforms allow you to import data from multiple sources. And tend to offer more customizations.But, if you’re not a data analyst, they can be more difficult to use.Google Looker Studio is one of the most popular choices. It’s a free tool that lets you import and visualize data from various sources, including Semrush.Here’s an analytics dashboard example featuring data from Semrush’s Domain Overview tool:Get started with our Google Looker Studio tutorial and templates.Or check out alternative tools like Microsoft Power BI and Tableau. The right platform for your needs depends on the data integrations, customizations, security features, and collaboration options available. In addition to your budget.5. Design and Share Your DashboardYou’re now ready to customize or build your analytics dashboard.Here are some tips to bear in mind, depending on your platform: Place the most important metrics near the top of the dashboard Group metrics by type so it’s easier to absorb information Use the most appropriate visualization for each type of data Include benchmarks and/or goals to put numbers into context Include data from a time range that makes sense for your needs (e.g., last 30 days)When you’re finished, share your analytics dashboard with relevant stakeholders.And gather feedback over time.Ask relevant stakeholders to share: Which metrics they use the most Which metrics they think are missing Anything they find hard to use or understandThis will allow you to make iterative improvements to your analytics dashboard.Analytics Dashboard ExamplesIf you need inspiration, check out these analytics dashboard examples: SEO Analytics Dashboard ExampleSEO analytics dashboards help users track performance of their SEO strategy.
