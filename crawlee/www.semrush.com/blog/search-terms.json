Search terms are the exact words or phrases users enter into search engines when they‘re looking for information, products, or services online.Think of the last thing you Googled. That was a search term.A search term is anything you type into a search engine. Yes, anything. Understanding the Google search terms people use to find your website, products or services can improve your search engine marketing results.Because it helps you optimize your website and ad campaigns for what people actually search for. What’s the Difference Between Search Terms and Keywords? Search terms are what users type into search engines. Keywords are the terms businesses target and optimize their content for.Often, they’re the same. But not always. For example, in pay-per-click advertising (PPC), keywords are the words or phrases Google Ads uses to match its ads with the terms people are searching for. Synonyms can trigger a match. Someone may type in the search term “best biodegradable cleaners for kitchens.” Which triggers an ad for “green cleaning products.” A keyword an advertiser has bid on.In search engine optimization (SEO), keywords are researched terms selected to target relevant topics. With the goal of improving your ranking in the search engine results pages (SERPs).Someone may type in “pre owned camping equipment” and see the No. 1 result is a page titled “Used Camping Equipment.” The site has targeted this keyword in its content, and Google understands that it matches what the user is looking for. People type all kinds of common words and phrases into Google. They don’t necessarily know or care about using precise keywords. They just want their questions answered. Your keyword-targeted content works to do that. In summary, search terms come from users. Keywords are identified and targeted by you.Why Are Search Terms Important? Search terms provide valuable information to businesses. They tell you exactly what a user is searching for.Use this knowledge to optimize your content and ad campaigns. So you can reach more customers. And scale your business.Why Search Terms Are Important for PPC Analyzing search terms helps you manage your PPC campaigns to maximize your return on investment (ROI).Because you can use search term data to help you identify the most relevant and profitable keywords to target with your ad campaigns.Here’s how:To run a Google Ad, set the keyword match type to dictate how closely a keyword needs to match the user’s search term.There are three types: Broad match: Searches that use related keywords can trigger an ad. For example, an ad for the keyword “fitness equipment” showing when someone uses the search term “workout gear” because they’re conceptually similar. Phrase match: Ads can show when the search term includes the keyword’s meaning. Such as an ad for “running shoes” when the user searches “trendy running shoes.” Exact match: An ad may show when the search term has the same meaning or search intent as the keyword. Like “men's gym shorts” and “gym shorts for men.” To earn traffic that converts, balance reach with relevance. By deciding how closely search terms should match keywords.Choosing the right match type helps ensure your budget is spent efficiently on clicks that are more likely to convert.And that starts with analyzing search terms.To further optimize your ad performance, leverage negative keywords to exclude ads from showing when users use certain search terms.For example, if your photography business targets “wedding photographer” but gets clicks for “wedding videographer,” adding “videographer” as a negative keyword prevents showing ads for that irrelevant search term.This helps prevent wasted ad spend. A key part of PPC strategy. Why Search Terms Matter for SEO Understanding the search terms your target audience uses tells you how people find your website. And what they’re looking for. So you can ensure your content addresses their needs.For example, you’re a florist in Miami with a product page for tulip floral arrangements.But then you use Google Search Console to review the search terms people type into Google before they click on your product page. (More on how to do that later.)And there’s a problem. Hundreds of people type “tulip farm Holland, Michigan” before landing on your site.You’re not running a tulip farm in Michigan. You’re selling tulip arrangements in Florida. In reviewing your product page, a subhead near the top of the page details that your tulips are sourced from a “tulip farm in Holland, Michigan.”That’s likely why your website appears in Google results when people enter that search term. The problem is that those people are looking for tulip farms in Michigan, not florists in Florida.Your page isn’t optimized for the right keyword. Improving on-page SEO includes elements like heading structure. You can still detail your tulips source on the page, but it’s no longer the focus of the content. Instead, you replace it with a subhead that includes the keyword “tulip floral arrangements,” which is your primary keyword for that page. Next time you check Google Search Console, you see that clicks from “tulip farm Holland, Michigan” have decreased. Which is OK. Those visitors weren’t looking for what you were selling. But clicks from “tulip floral arrangements” have increased. Sending you qualified traffic and more potential customers. Google Analytics shows that conversions have increased, too.Understanding search terms means you can optimize for the right keywords. And doing that equals better SEO results.Further reading: SEO vs. PPC: What the Differences Are & When to Use EachHow to Identify Search Terms Identifying relevant search terms for your business is the first step in developing an effective search engine marketing strategy.Here are six ways to do that.View Search Terms in Google Ads Search Terms Report The Search Terms Report in Google Ads shows you the exact search terms that triggered your PPC campaign ads.To access it, go to your Google Ads account.Click “Campaigns” from the left-side menu.

How Search Intent Affects Search Terms Search intent is the underlying goal or motivation behind a user's search query. Their “why.” There are four main types of search intent: Informational: Users are looking for information. Like an answer to a question. A solution to a problem. Or an explanation of a topic. Commercial: Considering a purchase, but not yet decided on which one. They’re browsing product or brand options. Transactional: A user is ready to take action. Like making a purchase. Signing up for a newsletter. Downloading a free ebook. Navigational: Navigational intent indicates the user is trying to get somewhere online. Like logging into their banking account or Instagram profile. Pages that meet the searcher's intent usually have higher SEO rankings. Approach content with search intent in mind. Give the user exactly what they’re looking for. For example: If you’re writing content about “fast dinner recipes,” don’t create four-hour recipe content. Give users what they asked for. They’ll like it. And Google will reward it.Search Term Examples Paid Advertising Search Terms Example Let’s say you’re a plumber in Los Angeles managing your own Google Ads account. You add the keyword “plumber” to your campaign. Which means your ads could show up when potential customers search for \"plumber\" on Google.Someone in Los Angeles Googles “top LA plumbers.” Your ad shows up in their search results.In this example, the search term was “top LA plumbers.” And the keyword was “plumber.” Your ad showed up because you added that keyword to your Google Ads campaign. And the search term the searcher used contained your keyword.Organic Search Terms Example Say you’re creating a page for your website. And you want it to appear in Google search results. Specifically, when someone searches for plumbing services in your area. So, you optimize the page for this keyword: “Los Angeles plumber.”Like this:Not everyone who lands on your new page will type that exact phrase into Google. They’ll use variations. Like: Best plumber in Los Angeles Affordable Los Angeles plumbers Plumbing services LA Los Angeles emergency plumber Plumber near me (if the searcher is in L.A.)These are all search terms. But the result is the same:They share search intent with the keyword you’re targeting, so Google knows your page is the best solution to their query.
