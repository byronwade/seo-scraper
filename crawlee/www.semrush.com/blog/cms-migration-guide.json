  "content": "Your website almost certainly operates via a content management system (CMS). That’s a software platform for creating, managing, and publishing digital content.And there may come a time when your existing CMS simply doesn’t cut it anymore. Perhaps it’s not performance-friendly, doesn’t scale well, or is simply too expensive.When this happens, it’s often wise to consider migrating to a different CMS.In this guide, we’ll give you a step-by-step tutorial to perform a CMS migration. We’ll also touch on the main reasons why you might want to migrate to a new CMS (even though your existing one seems fine). Plus, we’ll go over some search engine optimization (SEO) considerations to keep in mind before you decide to migrate.What Is a CMS Migration?A CMS migration is the process of migrating a website from one content management system to another. For example, migrating your website from WordPress to Webflow.Why would you need to migrate?Common reasons include: Access to more features: While CMSes often have similar features, your business’s specific needs might warrant functionality that’s not available on the platform you’re using (e.g., multilingual support, advanced SEO capabilities, etc.) A need to scale: It’s common to outgrow your CMS platform as your business grows and you start getting more website visits. Requiring you to migrate to one that can handle bigger traffic. Improved performance: Some content management systems simply provide better performance in terms of website loading speeds. And a faster website can improve the user experience (UX) you provide to visitors. Cost reduction: While CMS platforms usually aren’t prohibitively expensive, sometimes it makes sense to switch to another CMS to save on costs. For instance, enterprise-level CMS solutions can get pretty pricey. Enhanced security: If you have any security concerns regarding your current CMS, opting for a platform with upgraded security can give you peace of mind. Think two-factor authentication, granular user permissions, and regular automated security updates.Before you decide to migrate, you should know that a CMS migration can both positively and negatively impact your website’s SEO.How Can a CMS Migration Impact SEO?Migrating to a different CMS can result in several SEO benefits. Giving your website a greater chance of ranking higher in organic search. Further reading: The Importance of SEO: 10 Benefits of Search Engine OptimizationHere are a few common ways a CMS migration might positively impact your website’s SEO efforts: Mobile-friendliness: Your new CMS might have better support for responsive and mobile-friendly design, an important ranking signal in Google Search Page load speed: Migrating to a CMS that offers better website performance can result in improving page load speed—another Google ranking factor Navigation: A CMS that makes it easier for visitors to navigate your website can result in a better page experience (how visitors perceive the experience of using your website). Which in turn might help Google prioritize your website in search results. Structured data: Better implementation of schema markup can help your website align more closely with Google’s structured data guidelines. Making it eligible to appear in Google’s rich results. Multilingual support: If your website is available in multiple languages, a CMS that offers better multilingual support can help you ensure that search engines index all your multilingual pages. And display the correct page variants for relevant organic searches. This helps you maximize search engine visibility in international search results—and consequently increase your global traffic.There may also be instances when a CMS migration negatively affects your site’s SEO. Here are a few possible issues: Broken links: If the URLs of your pages change during the migration, this might result in broken links—which point to pages that don’t exist or can’t be accessed. Having too many broken links potentially signals to Google that your website isn’t up to date or regularly maintained, which could deprioritize it in search results. Loss of rankings: If you don’t use the same URLs for your pages after you migrate to a new CMS, search engines may not recognize them. Meaning you risk a loss in organic search rankings. Indexing issues: If your new CMS makes it difficult for Google to crawl your website (to understand what your website is about), Google may remove certain pages from its index. Which would make them ineligible to show up in search results. Duplicate content: It’s also possible that you recreate the same page multiple times by mistake during the migration process. Duplicate content on your website risks a Google penalty or pages not getting indexed at all.Main CMS Migration IssuesThere are a few common CMS migration problems you should be aware of before you move forward. These include:Loss of DataMigrating to a new CMS can sometimes result in the loss of important data (e.g., content, stylesheets, etc.)This is why you must back up all your data beforehand. And create a detailed CMS migration plan that takes into account all possible risks.Loss of FunctionalityNot every CMS offers the same features. So you need to be careful when choosing a new CMS platform.Make a list of all the features you might need from a CMS (e.g., a WYSIWYG editor, multilanguage support, etc.) Then, ensure that your new CMS supports all of those features before attempting to migrate.Here’s Squarespace, an example of a WYSIWYG editor:Layout and Design IssuesYour website design and layout might not transfer perfectly from your old CMS to the new one. Owing to differences in how the two platforms work.Here are some issues experienced in a migration to WordPress:The issue might be a quick fix—like changing fonts. Or something you’ll need to hire a developer for e(.g., reworking how the website appears on mobile devices).CMS Migration Step-by-Step ChecklistIn this section, we delve into the most important steps to follow when migrating to your new CMS.
