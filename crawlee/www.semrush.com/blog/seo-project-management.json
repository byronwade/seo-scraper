However, since SEO is an asynchronous activity, it becomes challenging to do it on a large scale. Why Project Management?

When a multitude of such projects come to you simultaneously, you must be apt in organizing time and resources for each of them. To make it a little easier for you, we have compiled the following SEO project and process management tips.1. Project Inception This is the first phase where interaction with the client begins. As a project manager, you should discuss an exhaustive list of topics with the client. Out of the discussion, you should formulate a clear set of deliverables on a weekly, fortnightly, or monthly basis. This communication will help you in understanding the client’s requirements in a better way and prepare your team in being in an ideal state to deliver results.

That is why to achieve the desired results, one needs to have a clear action plan.

Structure Each SEO Project in Detail Designing a detailed format SEO project can help you in streamlining the process. For that, you’ll need to identify resources at hand as well as issues at the fore and accordingly prioritize your activities. Below are steps to organize the process: Inception: Start with finalizing a to-do list. Discuss the strategic to-do list and the timelines with your team. Only commit to a to-do list after your team agrees to it. Planning: Plan the work and determine the human resources and the time required. You would then ascertain the tools the team would require. Based on the discussion with your internal team, you can choose to seek external help for activities that your team does not specialize in. And do not forget to add some buffer time in case a thing or two get delayed. Execution: Execute your plan and start your work. But do not forget to keep a record of every single activity and the overall project process. Measurement: Nearly 70% of people fail to achieve their goals. You are no different.

Depending on the workflow, regular check-ins can be daily, or weekly with your team, and weekly, fortnightly, or monthly for the client. Pro tip: Keep the meetings short and specific or otherwise you will be losing on a ton of time. 5. Create an Appropriate Timeline for Progress & Completion of All Tasks An appropriate timeline is the foundation of any project. It contains specific tasks assigned to a team member and a deadline when the task needs to be completed. An organized timeline ensures fast delivery, reduced risk, improved productivity, and progress tracking. With this method, we try our best to ensure that the delay caused by a particular task does not hamper the overall project. 6. Identify the Potential Risks or Roadblocks That May Appear Roadblocks can quite literally stop you in your tracks. Identifying these roadblocks and responding to challenges is a significant component of project management. Whatever the roadblock is, project managers are the closest to being able to identify them, and it is their role to do something about it. For example, a team member who usually works on content optimization becomes ill. A project manager can quickly seek help from a different team or an external freelancer. 7.
