But are your efforts yielding positive results?You need to be tracking the right key performance indicators (KPIs) to know.In this guide, we’ll discuss important social media KPIs, how to pick the right ones, and how to track them.But first, let’s start with the basics.What Are Social Media KPIs?Social media KPIs are the metrics you’ve selected to measure how effective your social media marketing efforts are.They quantify whether your strategy was successful. And highlight which activities are achieving the targets—and which ones aren’t.For example, here’s the Insights dashboard from Instagram that shows several metrics you may be tracking as KPIs:Why Is It Important to Track Social Media KPIs?Here are some of the reasons why you should define and track social media marketing KPIs: To measure progress toward goals: Social media KPIs provide a framework for tracking your progress toward larger department and company objectives To make Informed decisions: Social media marketing KPIs highlight specific successes and reveal patterns. To provide a factual basis for strategic decisions. To benchmark against the competition: They allow you to compare your performance against competitors. To gain insights into your market position and highlight areas where you have a competitive advantage.18 Social Media KPIs to TrackThere are many different types of KPIs for social media marketing. We’ve split them into five broad categories—and included common metrics companies typically track under each category. Visibility Engagement Conversion Customer satisfaction Share of voiceSocial Media KPIs Focused on VisibilityThese metrics show how many people (both your followers and those who don’t follow you) see your content.The more people you’re visible to, the more opportunities you have to engage users, build relationships, and drive conversions. Here are the top social media KPIs to track visibility:1. ImpressionsImpressions are the total number of times your content has been displayed on a social media feed.This metric includes every instance your content is loaded in a user's feed—whether it's an original post or a share.It also accounts for multiple views by the same user. So, the more your content appears in feeds, the higher your impression count will be.Here's an example from LinkedIn showing the number of impressions a post has received:Why Impressions Are Important Impressions give you a sense of how much exposure your content is getting. If your impressions are high, it means your content is widely circulated. Which could lead to better brand recognition—and eventually more followers and higher engagement.2. Video ViewsVideo views refer to the number of times users have watched your video content on social media.Different social media platforms have different criteria for what counts as a view. For instance, a view is counted on Facebook when a user watches the video for at least three seconds. On YouTube, it’s counted when a user watches at least 30 seconds.Here’s an example from YouTube showing the number of video views:Why Video Views Are ImportantVideo views serve as an indicator of the audience’s interest in your video content.A high number of views suggests that your videos are appealing to your audience. And that your content aligns with what they want to see.This can aid your content creation strategy. Helping you produce more of the types of videos that your audience is drawn to.3. Post ReachPost reach refers to the number of unique users who’ve seen your social media post.This is different from impressions.How?Reach is the number of unique users who see your content—counting each user only once, regardless of multiple viewsHere’s an example from Facebook showing the number of people a post has reached when you click “See insights and ads”:Why Post Reach Is Important Reach helps you understand how far your content is spreading beyond your immediate followers. And gives you a good gauge of how large your potential audience may be.4. Follower CountFollower count is the number of users who’ve chosen to follow your social media profile. This count can include both individuals and brands.Your number of followers can go up when new people follow your profile. And it can go down when people decide to unfollow.But a drop in followers isn't always bad. It could mean that your content is becoming more targeted. And that you're narrowing in on a specific audience.Here’s an example of an X (formerly Twitter) profile showing the number of followers it has:Why Follower Count Is Important Your follower count gives you an idea of how popular your brand is. And also indicates whether people like your content and want to see more of it.5. Audience Growth RateAudience growth rate is the pace at which your social media following is increasing (or decreasing). And it’s represented as a percentage change from one period compared to the previous period.The audience growth rate is calculated by finding the difference between the number of followers at the end of the period and the start, then dividing by the number of followers at the start. The result is multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.Here’s an example from an Instagram profile showing its audience growth in a week:Why Audience Growth Rate Is Important Tracking your audience growth rate helps you understand how quickly you're gaining new followers. Rapid growth can be a sign of an effective social media strategy. And slow growth may indicate a need for adjustments in the social media calendar and overall approach.Social Media KPIs Focused on EngagementEngagement metrics measure how users interact with your social media content. They show your audience's level of involvement with your brand. Which helps indicate how much they value your posts. Here are some common social media KPIs that highlight engagement:6. ReactionsReactions are a basic form of engagement. They typically involve users clicking a “Like,” “Love,” “Celebrate,” or similar button. The type and range of reactions available can vary by social media platform.For instance, Facebook offers a range of reactions, including \"Love,\" \"Angry,\" and \"Sad.\" While platforms like Instagram primarily focus on \"Likes.\"These reactions provide a simple way for users to interact with your content and express their sentiments.Here’s an example from LinkedIn showing the number of reactions a post has received:Why Reactions Are Important Tracking reactions helps you understand which content is meaningful for your audience. A high number of reactions is a good sign of your content hitting the mark. And it can inform your social media content strategy. So you keep creating content your audience wants.7. CommentsComments are written responses that users add to your social media content.These responses can be directed at the original post or serve as replies to other comments.Users may also tag your account or other users' accounts in their comments. Fostering a more interactive and engaging conversation around your content.Here’s an example from Reddit showing the number of comments a post has:Why Comments Are Important Comments show a deeper level of engagement than reactions. And they’re a very important KPI in social media. Because content with many comments may get more visibility. You can monitor comments to gain insights into your audience's preferences. To help you improve your social media management strategy.8. SharesShares occur when users repost your content on their own social media profiles.They might share your post just as it is. Or, they might add their own thoughts to it. When they add their own thoughts, it can offer more context and added perspective to the content.Here’s an example from TikTok showing the number of shares a video has received:Why Shares Are Important A high number of shares can significantly increase your social media visibility and attract new followers.And because users are recommending your content, shares act as endorsements.9. SavesSaves are when users save your post for viewing later. (On X, this KPI is called a \"Bookmark.\")Users have the flexibility to save and unsave posts at any time.They can also go to a specific section on their profile to view all the posts they've saved.Some platforms (like Instagram) even allow users to create collections by grouping saved posts into different categories. Helping them organize content that they find valuable.Here’s what the save button looks like on an Instagram post:Why Saves Are Important Saves indicate that users find your content valuable enough to revisit. That's a strong sign of interest and engagement. 10. Average Engagement RateYour average engagement rate can be represented in a few ways. But it’s often the percentage of people that interact with your content relative to the total number of followers you have.You can calculate the average engagement rate by dividing the total number of engagements (likes, comments, shares, etc.) your posts received by the total number of posts in a given time frame. Next, divide that result by the number of followers you have. And then multiply by 100 to get the rate.Here’s what the formula looks like:Why Average Engagement Rate Is Important A high engagement rate indicates that your content is resonating with your audience—sparking their interest and initiating conversations.It demonstrates that your social content is relevant and high quality.Further reading: 11 Ways to Create Engaging Social Media ContentSocial Media KPIs Focused on ConversionsConversion metrics measure how effectively your content is driving users to take a desired action.

With the product, service, or experience.To find your social media CSAT score, you can conduct surveys or polls on social media platforms asking followers how they would describe their overall satisfaction with the product or service.They’ll rate their satisfaction on a scale of one to five. Where one is “very unsatisfied,” and five is “very satisfied.”The CSAT score is determined by dividing the number of satisfied customers (those who rated their satisfaction as four or five) by the total number of responses.
