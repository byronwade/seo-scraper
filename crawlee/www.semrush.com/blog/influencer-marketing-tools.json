PricingAudience Intelligence starts at $150 monthly for one report.

They offer a hybrid agency-SaaS model, with professional services available as an add-on to platform plans. An annual contract is required.PitchboxCompared to the all-in-one influencer marketing tools above, Pitchbox is a more specialized solution for outreach.Use cases: Influencer outreachPitchbox is built primarily for link building use cases.

Or make a custom offer.All outreach and conversations with influencers happen directly within the platform. Collabstr processes the influencer payments, too.What We LikeThe advantage of using a marketplace like Collabstr is that the creators are proactively looking for collaborations. And their pricing is often publicly listed. Together, those two things make recruitment much faster.The flip side is that the potential pool of influencers is much smaller, and they’re likely working with similar brands already. But if you need to move quickly, it could be a good option for your brand.PricingCollabstr has no upfront cost. The platform charges a 15% fee on the creator’s earnings and offers optional managed services for brands.StoryclashStoryclash is a multi-purpose influencer marketing platform.Use cases: Influencer discovery Influencer campaign tracking Reporting on influencer marketing Influencer CRMLike some of the tools above (Modash, Grin, Upfluence), Storyclash is an all-in-one tool.It has features for: Influencer discovery: Including AI search to find influencers using natural language.

For example, you can add negative keywords to remove irrelevant conversations. Or, filter by platform or country. PricingAwario pricing starts from $49/month (paid monthly) or $29/month (paid annually).How Influencer Marketing Tools Fit Into Your StrategyInfluencer marketing tools can’t create a strategy for you. But they help you to execute tasks more efficiently.That means you need to have a basic strategy in place before onboarding a tool. Once your strategy is clear, you can better discern which influencer marketing tools align best with your needs.Here are some key considerations you should address:Goals for Influencer MarketingWhat do you want to achieve with influencer marketing? Is it: A performance channel measured by directly attributable sales? A brand awareness channel measured by reach and engagement? A mix?Your answer could change your tool requirements.For example, if your goal is sales, you’ll need a tool that supports link clicks and promo code redemptions for attribution.How to Compensate InfluencersThere are several ways to compensate influencers. Like: Gifting free products Affiliate commissions Flat fee payments Free trips and experiences(It’s common to use a mixture.)The type of compensation you plan to use will impact your tooling decisions. For example, some tools can support affiliate links and payouts, while others can’t. Similarly, some tools help with shipping products to influencers—while others don’t.The Type and Size of Influencer You’ll Collaborate withYour budget and strategy will change the type of influencer you aim to collaborate with (which, in turn, changes your tool requirements).For example, if you’re compensating via affiliate commissions or free products, you’ll probably need to find a high volume of nano influencers (1,000-10,000 followers). Since larger influencers are more likely to require upfront fees.You should also think about which social platforms your target audience hangs out on. Not every tool in this list supports every social platform. Some can’t find Instagram influencers, others can’t find Twitch influencers (etc.).Accelerate Your Influencer Program with ToolsYou might not need influencer marketing tools from day one. But once you’re starting to gain traction with influencer collaborations, tools quickly become a no-brainer to scale your program.The best tools for you depend on your strategy and budget.If you want to find and work with YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok influencers, try a free trial of Influencer Analytics. It has everything you need to research competitors, find your first influencers, and manage the campaign.",
