You want to provide valuable and engaging information that answers your visitors’ questions and solves their problems. Style: How your website looks and feels.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO)SEO is the process of improving your site’s visibility in search engines. It can help you drive more organic (unpaid) traffic, leads, and sales.SEO is one of the most effective digital channels because it helps you reach your target audience when they’re looking for the products or services you offer.For example, investment firm Charles Schwab created a landing page targeting the keyword “Roth IRA.”The landing page is optimized using secondary keywords like “what is a Roth IRA” and “why consider a Roth IRA,” among other things.And that page ranks number one on Google. With a featured snippet, at that.So anyone looking up Roth IRAs will probably see and click on the link to Charles Schwab’s landing page.Which is probably why the page gets around 327K organic visitors per month, according to the Organic Research tool.How to Get Started with SEOHere are three steps to get started with SEO:Do Keyword ResearchKeywords are the words and phrases users type into search engines.Your first step to effective SEO is to find which keywords your target audience is using to search for products or services like yours.You can use keyword research tools like the Keyword Magic Tool to discover and analyze keywords. Start by choosing keywords with high search volume, low competition, and high relevance for your website.Further reading: How to Do Keyword Research for SEO (A Detailed 3-Step Guide)Optimize for On-Page SEOThe second step is to optimize your pages for your target keywords. On-page SEO is the practice of crafting your content to match searcher intent. I.e., turning your content into what searchers want to see when they search for a specific keyword.And optimizing some technical aspects of your pages to make them more user-friendly for visitors.You can use a tool like On-Page SEO Checker to crawl your site and get optimization ideas.Like this:Common tasks associated with on-page SEO involve optimizing aspects of your content such as: Title tags: Title tags are the clickable headlines that can appear on the search engine results pages (SERPs). Include your target keyword and a compelling value proposition in title tags. Meta descriptions: Meta descriptions are snippets of text that can appear below the title tags on the SERPs. Include your target keyword and a clear call to action in meta descriptions. Headings: Headings are words or phrases that structure your pages. Use headings to organize content and include your target keyword and related keywords in your headings. Content: Content is the main text and images that convey your message and offer on your pages. Create content that is valuable, engaging, and relevant for your target keyword and audience. URLs: URLs are the web addresses that identify your pages. Create URLs that are short and descriptive. And include your target keyword.Further reading: On-Page SEO: What It Is and How to Do ItOptimize for Off-Page SEO Off-page SEO is the practice of increasing a website’s popularity and reputation through external factors, such as links, local SEO, and reviews. Which means that the third step is to build your website’s authority and trustworthiness. You’ll want to focus on aspects such as: Backlinks: Backlinks are links from other websites that point to yours. They’re like votes of confidence for your website. Which is why pages with lots of high quality backlinks often rank higher on Google. Try to get backlinks from high-quality and relevant websites that have authority and trust in your niche. Local SEO: Local SEO blends both on-page and off-page optimization. It involves using the Google Business Profile, reviews, local citations, and other key features to rank in Google’s map results.

Paid AdvertisingPaid advertising is a type of digital marketing channel that involves paying to display ads to a targeted audience on different online platforms. Here is what paid ads look like on Google.Companies pay to show up first on the search results page for relevant keywords. Which is why there’s a “Sponsored” tag above each ad.Two common paid ad models are pay-per-click (PPC) and cost per impression (CPM). Both can be cost effective since you only pay every time someone clicks on or sees your ad.Unlike organic marketing, where you create content and optimize your site for search engines, paid advertising lets you reach potential customers faster and more directly.Among many other things, paid advertising is important because it can help you: Drive more highly targeted traffic to specific pages Test and optimize your marketing messages and offers Target specific audience segments based on demographics, interests, behaviors, and locations Retarget people who visited your site but didn’t take action Track and measure your return on investment (ROI) and performanceHow to Get Started with Paid AdsTo get started with paid advertising, first choose the platforms that match your goals, budget, and audience. One of the most popular is Google Ads. It lets you show your ads on Google’s search results, as well as on millions of websites that are part of the Google Display Network.Which means your ads can appear on websites like this:Plus, you can also use Google Ads to create video ads on YouTube, shopping ads on Google Shopping, and app ads on Google Play.Other paid advertising platforms include Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and X Ads. Once you know where you want to run ads, do a bit of competitive research. Especially for Google Ads. Open Advertising Research, enter a competitor’s domain, and click “Search.” The “Positions” tab will show the keywords they’re bidding on and the target URLs. Click the “Ad Copies” tab. You’ll see the exact ads they’re running. And the keywords that trigger those ads. Then, you can head to the “Competitors” tab to discover new rivals. Repeat this tactic for each of your main competitors. And use the insights to get more out of your marketing efforts. Finally, create your ad.You can use Canva to create the image for your ad. Or use AdCreative.ai to generate one with AI.And then either write the copy manually or get help from AI with the free Social Media Post Generator.Get more in-depth knowledge about paid ads by checking out Sermrush’s guides (listed below).Further reading: Online Advertising: All You Need to Know What Is Retargeting and How Does It Work?7.
