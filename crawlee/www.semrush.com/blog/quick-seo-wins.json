  "content": "Search engine optimization is a long-term approach. But you can take steps to speed up your progress. Here are 10 quick SEO tips that can rapidly improve performance:1. Add Descriptive Internal LinksInternal links point from one page on your site to another. They help readers and search engines discover more of your content. And let you distribute link equity—or link “juice”—throughout your site’s pages.That can give your pages an SEO boost.So, include links to lower-authority pages (pages with low traffic and few backlinks) on higher-authority pages (pages with solid traffic and plenty of backlinks).To find your most authoritative pages, use Semrush’s Backlinks Analytics tool.Enter your domain and click “Analyze.”Click “Indexed Pages.”Sort by “Domains” (the default) to find pages with the highest number of referring domains, meaning websites that link to yours. When you have a lot of high-quality domains linking to your content, this tells Google that those pages are the most authoritative.Add internal links on those pages to distribute their link equity to more of your content.Pro tipUse descriptive anchor text—the clickable part of your internal link—and avoid phrases like “click here.” Descriptive anchor text helps search engines (and readers) understand what the linked page is about. For example, the anchor text below tells us that the linked page is about buyer persona templates: 2. Optimize Title Tags Title tags—or <title> tags—are what search engines often use as clickable links on search engine results pages (SERPs). They can give Google and users an impression of what your page is about. And how relevant it is to users’ search queries.Title tags are also important because they tell readers what your content is about. And help them decide whether to click on your site. So, title tags can impact your organic (unpaid) traffic.Here’s what a title tag can look like when it is displayed on a Google SERP:And here’s what a title tag can look like in your site’s HTML code:A title tag that satisfies search engines and users is: Relevant: It accurately describes what’s on the page and meets search intent Keyword-friendly: It contains the page’s primary keyword Appealing: It’s written to capture reader attention An appropriate length: It’s between 50 to 60 characters to avoid getting cut off (truncated). Like this:Using these guidelines, here’s an example of a good title tag:Review your title tags in your content management system (CMS). Most CMSs have built-in functionality or plugins to let you easily update your title tags. Yoast is a good example of a WordPress plugin that lets you easily adjust title tags:Rewrite any title tags that don’t hit the previous bullet points.Then, monitor your click-through rate (CTR)—the percentage of people who click your site in the search results—in a tool like Google Search Console (GSC).Follow Google’s instructions if you haven’t configured GSC yet. Then, click “Performance.” Select “Average CTR” and click “Pages.” (Click “Total clicks” and “Total impressions” to turn them off.) Now, you can review the CTR of your pages. If your CTR increases after rewriting your title tags, you’re on the right track. But if it decreases, make a list of new title tag variations. Think about where you might be missing the mark—does it match search intent? Include your primary keyword? Stand out on the SERP?If you’re stuck, head over to our free AI Title Generator. Just enter your keyword or topic, click “Get my titles,” and pick your favorite.3. Improve Image SEOImage SEO is the process of optimizing pictures on your site to help them rank in Google Images:This offers you another source of traffic besides clicks on the regular Google results.Prime your pictures for search by: Compressing your pictures with a tool like TinyPNG. Compression gives you a smaller file size, often without affecting picture quality. (Smaller image sizes also improve page speed, which is a ranking factor. Writing descriptive alt text. Alt text describes what a picture shows. It helps search engines understand the picture content, so they know what keywords to associate it with. And it makes your website more accessible to people with visual impairments. Include relevant keywords and try to describe each picture in 125 characters or fewer. Using keyword-rich file names. Instead of naming your picture 12345.jpg, succinctly describe it and include relevant keywords. Like red-cotton-tshirt.jpg.Then, track your image performance in GSC.Head to “Search results” and change the “Search type” to “Image.”If your pictures are ranking on Google Images, you should see an increase in “Total Impressions.” And possibly “Total Clicks” (if people are clicking on them).Scroll down to “Top queries” to see which keywords your pictures rank for.Further reading: Google Search Console: The Ultimate Guide for 20244. Fix Broken LinksA broken link is an internal or external link that doesn’t work.

Claim Brand MentionsFinding sites where someone mentioned your brand without linking to it is an opportunity for a quick SEO win: new backlinks.Let’s say we came across a piece that included “Semrush” without a backlink to our site:We could reach out to the author and them to change the brand mention into a link to our site.Start by making a list of branded names, like: Your business name Variations of your business name (like common misspellings) Your business URL Trademarked product names Names of influential people within your company (like your CEO and founders)Then, use the Brand Monitoring tool to track these key terms.Select “Brand” from the drop-down.Enter your brand name. And specifics like certain countries or languages you want to monitor.NoteUnder “Sources,”deselect social media sites. Since we just want to view websites that mention you but don’t link to you. Then, click “Create query.” And create new queries for each brand-related keyword you want to monitor by clicking “New query.”When you’re done, click on “Query list” to view them all. Pick a query and then click “Filters” and “Article backlinks.” Select “Without backlinks” and click “Save.”Now, you can see websites that mention your brand but don’t link to you. Pay attention to the site’s Authority Score (AS)—a Semrush authority metric calculated via the site’s quality and SEO performance, among other factors—and the estimated reach of the page. Prioritize reaching out to websites with the highest AS and audience reach on your list. Getting a backlink from them will give you a stronger backlink profile than getting a link from a smaller or less credible site.Further reading: How to Use Outreach for Link Building8. Add a Table of ContentsWhile having a table of contents (ToC) isn't a ranking factor, those separately linked sections can help you rank for different keywords. And get more trafficFor example, our ToC below has headings like “What Is Content Marketing” and “Why Is Content Marketing Important?” Each heading has a jump link with a unique URL that takes readers to that specific section.
