Getting the Most Out of AI SEO SoftwareAI SEO software tools aren’t a direct substitute for human-generated content. Human involvement in the content creation process is needed to maintain high-quality standards.Why?AI can access data quickly. But it doesn’t always accurately cite sources or understand context, nuance, and subjective factors that content creation requires. Marketing tech founder Nate Materson shared an example of how AI-created content initially worked for a company but later saw diminishing performance. The charts in the example show how organic traffic and keyword rankings dropped off:The takeaway is clear: AI SEO tools should complement human content creation. Keep this in mind as you incorporate AI SEO tools.A Ticket to SEO SuccessWe covered the 10 best AI SEO tools to help marketers and SEO professionals optimize their content, analyze their competitors’ strategies, and plan their own strategies with data-driven insights.
