The interface is user-friendly, providing accurate and reliable information so you can make the right decisions. Suppose you want to target \"best hiking boots.\" First, the Keyword Overview tool will show you the search volume, intent, and level of competition for this keyword. That gives you an idea of the query’s popularity and demand.Intent tells you if this search indicates a need for informational, commercial, transactional, or navigational results. Nailing down the search intent of a results page is necessary before planning your content. When you understand the intent, you can plan your page to offer people what they’re looking for and leave them satisfied. Down towards the bottom of the report you can see the SERP Analysis table.
