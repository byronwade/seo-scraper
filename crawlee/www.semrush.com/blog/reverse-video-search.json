Then, the tool references its index to display similar matches in your search results. The caveat is you usually need to search for videos using a thumbnail—not a video.Here’s why:Search engines don’t index all of the frames from videos because it’s uneconomical. And would require the storage of quadrillions of images. They usually only index a video’s thumbnail. If the video doesn’t have one, Google will extract a frame from the video to use as its thumbnail.This is why you might not find videos if you search using screenshots from random points in the video. Because those frames aren’t likely indexed anywhere.Further reading: Video SEO: How to Get Your Videos Ranked on GoogleHow to Reverse Search a Video on DesktopUse one—or more—of the tools below to perform your reverse search.

This can be an effective way of enforcing copyright if you publish your videos to YouTube.Further reading: YouTube SEO: How to Boost Your Channels’ VisibilityContent IdeasReverse searches display related content, which can help inspire new content ideas.
