Such as PDFs, spreadsheets, presentations, Adobe files, and more.Let’s see how.How to Search Google by File Type Search Google by file type using the “filetype:” search operator. This operator narrows the search results to a specific file type.For example, a search for “filetype:pdf health” will show PDF files that contain the word “health.”A search for “filetype:ppt travel” will show presentations related to travel. This is possible because Google is able to crawl and index different types of files.

So they can be indexed by Google. And rank in search results.Key Takeaways You can use Google to search for more than just your standard HTML webpages. The “filetype:'' search operator allows you to search for non-HTML files. Google can crawl and index different kinds of files. For example, xls, ppt, pdf, txt, etc. Ensure Google is able to crawl and index your files with the Site Audit tool",
