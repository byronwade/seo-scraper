In this guide, you’ll learn about the essential slides your presentation should include to impress investors. And get inspiration from seven pitch deck examples.Let’s get started. What Is a Pitch Deck?A pitch deck is a presentation that founders use to explain their business model or idea to potential investors. And why investors should consider funding the venture.A pitch deck alone won’t help you secure funding. Because acquiring financial support is a complex, multi-step process.But a good pitch deck can spark enough interest among potential investors to earn you a follow-up meeting.With that in mind, let’s go over what your pitch deck should include. Pro tipUse our Market Explorer tool to learn about your market size, audience demographics, and top competitors. And create a data-backed pitch deck that wows investors.11 Essential Pitch Deck Presentation SlidesHere’s what goes into a pitch deck that wows investors: 1. IntroductionYour introduction slide should communicate what you do. And how your company solves a problem for your target audience. This makes a memorable first impression. And sets the stage for the rest of your presentation.For example, Careerist did this with one brief sentence: \"We finance, train, and place job seekers in tech and beyond.\"Need more inspiration? Check out these value proposition examples from other companies' pitch decks: Airbnb: \"Book rooms with locals, rather than hotels.\" Softr: “No-code SaaS platform for SMEs to turn their data into custom apps.” Youreka: “Digital assistant for frontline workers.” Synder: “Easy accounting focused on ecommerce.”2. ProblemPotential investors need to understand what your business solves to understand why you matter. Ideally, this means highlighting a gap in the market that you address.Focus on two or three core problems. And keep the content clear and concise.Cloud application hosting platform Render listed three core problems its product solves that others don’t. 3. SolutionInstead of listing your features, highlight the benefits. Because focusing on how your solution helps your target market is much more impactful.If possible, include evidence such as early test results, customer testimonials, or case studies.Don’t overpromise. Realistically show what your product or service will deliver. 4. Market ValidationThis slide is about proving there’s demand for your product or service. To increase your chances of being funded. To do this, present concrete evidence that shows your target market would be willing to buy your offering. Which you can do with market studies, customer surveys, or sales data.Apollo, a sales intelligence and engagement platform, used its past sales data to prove market validation in its pitch deck.5. Market SizeIt's also important to demonstrate your target market’s size. To show your idea has the potential for substantial revenue and growth.Provide hard numbers on things like the overall market value and expected growth over time. Use Semrush’s Market Explorer to research your target market’s size. The tool can tell you how big your market is. You’ll also see overall traffic trends.And gain insights into your audience’s locations.6. Product Use this slide to show off your product or service. And what makes it special. Include high-quality photos from multiple angles. And if possible, add a short video to help investors see your product or service in action.For example, equity management company Pulley used screenshots to demonstrate its product interface and features in its pitch deck.Pro tipTrying to get a business off the ground?

Business ModelGive investors a clear understanding of your business model, revenue streams, key partnerships, and how you plan to achieve profitability. So they can see that you have a clear path to success.Product discovery and development platform Fibery provided a quick overview of its business model in its pitch deck. And if you’re already driving traffic to your website, consider including information on which marketing channels are performing best.If you’re not using Google Analytics or a similar web analytics tool, use Semrush’s Traffic Analytics tool to quickly identify the top contributors to your website traffic. Launch the tool and enter your domain. Then, click “Analyze.”Scroll to the “Traffic Journey” section to see a visual representation of your top traffic sources.Use this information to make your pitch deck more persuasive. 8. Competitor AnalysisUse this slide to show investors who your main competitors are and how your business will beat the competition. Use Semrush’s Organic Research tool to discover your top competitors. Launch the tool, enter your domain, select your country, and click “Search.”Click the “Competitors” tab and look at the “Competitive Positioning Map.”Here, you’ll see a visual representation of your top organic search competitors. Scroll to “Organic Competitors” for a list of companies that compete in Google’s top 20 search results for relevant keywords. View each competitor’s estimated organic traffic to identify your biggest threats. Now, research your competitors by visiting their websites and gathering more data. And do a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis (SWOT analysis) for each one to gain a comprehensive understanding of their market positions: Strengths: Identify what each competitor does well. Like maintaining a positive brand reputation, creating proprietary technology, etc. Weaknesses: Recognize competitor shortcomings. Like negative feedback, lack of certain features, or high prices that aren't justified by additional value. Opportunities: Look for external factors you can use to improve your market position. Such as emerging market trends, changes in consumer behavior, or technological advancements. Threats: Determine what external factors could threaten your success. Like regulatory changes or economic downturns.Now, use your competitor research to create a slide that shows what sets your product or service apart from others. And consider visually comparing your product against competitors. 9. TractionIf your business has been operating for a while, provide a summary of your financial history. Including revenue and significant financial milestones. And be transparent about any debt or liabilities.Enterprise software company Fulfil.io clearly highlighted traction in its pitch deck. With a graph that shows revenue growth.10. Team Investors often say they invest in people—not just ideas. So, demonstrate your team’s strength, expertise, and credibility.Include photos, names, roles, and key contributions. This is something software company Hologram did well. The company highlighted top executives and their achievements in its pitch deck. 11. Financial ForecastOutline your future financial projections (based on market growth research and other data) to show you you expect revenue to grow over the next several years. And help solidify that you have a solid plan.For example, fintech app Relief highlighted its projected revenue with a graph. 7 Inspiring Pitch Deck Examples AirbnbAirbnb has raised billions of dollars to date and is now a publicly traded company.
