  "content": "Frequently asked question (FAQ) sections are a great way to enhance the user experience.They include common questions your business receives and provide visitors with answers.You’re about to learn why FAQ sections are important, how to find the right questions, and how to showcase them on your website. You’ll even see some FAQ page examples and get access to our free FAQ templates.Let’s begin.Why Do You Need an FAQ Section?FAQ sections are important because they help answer questions users have in a quick and easy way.Like our FAQ page for Semrush Content Marketplace:FAQs benefit customers by helping users navigate your site more easily and by making answers to their questions readily available. So they won’t need to contact anyone for help.Plus, a well-thought-out FAQ section can indicate to your customers that you understand their needs.FAQ sections can also decrease the burden on customer support teams by reducing the number of questions you may get via emails or support tickets. Is an FAQ Section the Same as a Knowledge Base?Generally speaking, an FAQ section is not as complex or comprehensive as a knowledge base.Knowledge bases contain many resources like detailed guides, video walk-throughs, and more. They aren’t just focused on common questions.So, a knowledge base is a much more extensive directory with more comprehensive content.Here’s an example of our knowledge base. You can see that it contains how-to articles, videos, toolkits, etc.Where Can You Find Questions to Include in Your FAQ Section?Gathering FAQs from multiple sources helps you create a comprehensive, helpful FAQ section on your website.You can find questions for your FAQs from the following sources:Customer ServiceYour customer service team knows exactly what questions are asked most often. And they also know the answers.So, speak to your customer service department to gather FAQs based on customer questions that come in via emails, phone calls, and support tickets.Google Search ConsoleGoogle Search Console (GSC) can show you which question-based keywords people are searching for in Google that your site ranks for. You can also use GSC data to see what FAQ pages need to be updated or may be missing.In GSC, click on “Search results” on the left-hand menu.Click “+ New,” then select “Query.”Choose “Custom (regex),” and then “Matches regex.” In the the “Enter regular expression (regex)” box, copy and paste this text: \\b(who|what|where|when|why|how|was|did|do|is|are|arent|wont|does|if|can)\\bThe “|” means “or” and “/b” sets boundaries around the words (meaning they stand alone as opposed to appearing within another word). So, the results will be filtered to include all search terms you’re ranking for that contain those question words. Comb through the queries you see in the table. And make note of ones that are specific to your business. Because those are good options to include on an FAQ page. People Also AskPeople also ask (PAA) boxes in search results can show FAQs that are related to your main topic. So, it’s a good idea to leverage them.For example, let’s say you provide organic lawn care. Go to Google and type in “lawn fertilizing,” and then scroll down to the PAA section. NoteNot all Google searches will show a PAA section.If you want to see more PAA questions, open and then close one of the questions. This will trigger more to appear below.Quora, Reddit & Other Question SitesQuestion sites such as Quora and Reddit are a gold mind for finding even more FAQ topics for your customers. Because they usually include a lot of detail and come with personal experiences. Many questions on these sites are niche-specific as well.Simply visit one of these sites and enter a topic related to your business into their search bar. You’ll likely get a long list of questions and posts that can inform your FAQ page.Keyword ResearchDoing keyword research can help you find valuable keywords related to your niche that would fit perfectly on an FAQ page. And that can also improve your visibility in search results.You can use our Keyword Magic Tool for this.To get started, enter your brand name, choose your country, and click “Search.”You’ll be taken to the results. Which show tons of keywords related to your brand.Click on “Questions” on the left-hand side.This will show you a list of questions related to your brand name that users are searching for on a regular basis. You can even see the keyword search volume—the average number of times a keyword is searched for per month.If you don’t have much brand awareness, you can enter a competitor’s brand name that can be translated to your brand.It’s also a good idea to use search terms that are about your broader niche.In the tool enter your niche-specific keyword, choose your country, and click “Search.” In the results screen, Click on the “Questions” tab on the left-hand side.You can now see a list of relevant questions users are asking that aren’t directly related to your brand but are still relevant to your business.You can narrow down the questions even more by looking into specific types of questions. Here’s a list of question modifiers that you may find helpful for this: Are Aren’t Can Did Do Does How If Is Was What When Where Who Why Won’tTo do this, click on “Include Keywords,” choose “All keywords,” enter your modifier, and click “Apply.”FAQ Page Best Practices for Your WebsiteNow that you’ve gathered your questions, here’s how you can create an FAQ page that satisfies users and search engines:Choose the Right Format and LayoutThe best FAQ formats keep things visually organized so users can easily navigate to what they want to find.And there are multiple FAQ formats that can be used.If you’re a small brand or just getting started, a simple webpage will do. You can display FAQs in normal text on your webpages.Using accordions or tabs helps present a lot of information in an organized format if you have a more complex FAQ section. Accordions and tabs also have the benefit of keeping a user on one page.Here’s an example of what tabs look like.And here’s an example of what accordions look like.Here are some other elements you may want to include on your FAQ page: Search box: Adding a search box can help users find answers much faster by typing in keywords Categories: Grouping FAQs by category (which can be part of an accordion or tab setup or not) allows users to quickly navigate to the answers they’re looking for Featured questions: Including the most commonly asked questions at the top of the page creates an information hierarchy Related FAQs: Linking to related FAQs within the main section of a question-specific FAQ page can help users explore more questions they may not have thought of asking just yet Related content: Linking to related articles and resources that are outside of the FAQ section may also be helpful to users who want to dive into more knowledgeUse a Logical URL StructureUsing a consistent and simple URL structure can make it easy to keep your FAQ page (or FAQ pages) organized for both users and search engines.Some businesses will only have one FAQ page. Large brands may even have category pages and FAQ child pages—more specific FAQ pages that fall under the category pages.Here’s an example of a good URL structure for a brand with many FAQ pages: Page Type URL Example Main FAQ page /faqs/ FAQ category page /faqs/shipping/ Individual FAQ child page /faqs/how-long-does-shipping-take/ Leverage Internal LinkingAn internal link is when you link from one page on your website to another page on your website.Adding internal links will help users navigate your FAQs easily and can also help rankings. Because it makes it easier for search engine bots to crawl (discover) your pages. Increasing their odds of being indexed (stored in a database) and ranked.An important part of internal linking is anchor text (the clickable text used to link to other pages). So, make sure to use anchor text that describes the page you’re linking to. Like this:The example below is a help center that serves as an FAQ page.You can see that the FAQ category pages are linked to from “See all articles.” But there are also links to individual FAQ child pages such as “How to tweet.”Include Contact InformationIf a user isn’t able to find answers to their questions, they may not end up becoming a customer.By adding your contact details to your FAQ section, you can make it easier for users to get their questions answered, and increase the chances of them doing business with you.Keep Your FAQs UpdatedHaving outdated information in your FAQ section is very frustrating to users. The whole point of FAQs is to be helpful and answer questions accurately.If users are getting outdated information, they may not take your business very seriously. Or even lose trust in your company.Outdated Best Practice: Use FAQ SchemaSchema is a type of code that helps search engines make more sense of the information on your webpages. Adding schema to your webpages can also help your webpages stand out more on search engines results pages (SERPs).One type of schema relevant to FAQs is FAQ schema.Here’s an example of what FAQ schema looks like on a Google SERP.In August of 2023, Google announced that: “Going forward, FAQ (from FAQPage structured data) rich results will only be shown for well-known, authoritative government and health websites. For all other sites, this rich result will no longer be shown regularly.”This means that adding FAQ schema to websites that are not well-known, authoritative government or health websites likely won’t trigger FAQ schema on Google’s SERPs.FAQ Templates and Examples to Inspire YouThere are many ways to display your FAQs.
