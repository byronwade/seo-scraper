  "content": "In this guide, we’ll teach you how to detect and deal with SEO plagiarism. We’ll also introduce the best plagiarism checker tools on the market. And give you tips on how to prevent plagiarism in your content.What Is SEO Plagiarism?SEO plagiarism is the act of copying content from other sources—without proper attribution or permission—as part of an effort to rank higher in search engines. Plagiarized content can include text, videos, images, and data.For example, let’s say someone directly copied paragraphs from your highly ranked blog post in order to compete for the same keywords. This could be considered SEO plagiarism.SEO plagiarism can result in reputational damage, problems with search engines, and even legal action. These consequences can occur even if the work was plagiarized by accident.You can use SEO plagiarism tools to check your own content. And find out whether others have plagiarized your work.Types of SEO PlagiarismThere are four main types of SEO plagiarism: Copying and pasting content. This is when someone directly copies and pastes content someone else created and owns onto their website. Without asking permission or giving appropriate credit. This is the most straightforward form of plagiarism. And the one that is easiest to find. Content spinning. This is when someone rewrites third-party content—either manually or using software—to make it appear original. This is usually done to create large volumes of content in a short period of time. Generative AI writing. Not all AI writing is plagiarism. But even the most advanced AI tools can plagiarize existing web content. This is more likely when AI tools are instructed to model their writing on existing web content. Self-plagiarism. This is when you duplicate your own content across multiple domains. This can still cause SEO problems, despite the fact that it’s your content.What Isn’t SEO Plagiarism?It isn’t SEO plagiarism when you: Read and analyze high-ranking content when writing. It can be useful to look at competing content, including doing topical research and conducting SERP analyses. This will give you insight into what Google thinks people are searching for, otherwise known as search intent. But be careful not to plagiarize anything, even accidentally. Use generative AI tools. While AI tools have the potential to produce plagiarized content, that doesn’t mean you can’t use them. We recommend running any AI-generated content through one of the SEO plagiarism tools discussed below. Duplicate content on a single domain. Posting identical or near-identical content in several places on a single domain is not SEO plagiarism. But be aware that this type of duplicate content is generally not a good idea for SEO.Is All SEO Plagiarism Copyright Infringement?No, not all forms of SEO plagiarism are copyright infringement.SEO plagiarism is a much broader offense than copyright infringement. And acts that wouldn’t meet the legal definition of copyright infringement are still plagiarism. Content spinning, for example, may not always infringe copyright. But it is certainly SEO plagiarism. Further reading: Learn more about the most common legal aspects of blogging and content marketing.Does Plagiarism Affect SEO?Yes, plagiarism negatively affects SEO. Plagiarism can lead to lower search rankings in engines, reputational damage, and lower content quality.Search Engine PenaltiesIf a search engine believes you are plagiarizing content in a way that violates its policies, it can penalize your website by lowering your search rankings or removing your website from its index altogether. For Google, some forms of plagiarism may be a violation of the “Scraped Content” section of its spam policies. As the policy states:Scraped content, even from high quality sources, without additional useful services or content provided by your site may not provide added value to users. It may also constitute copyright infringement.If Google believes you have violated its policies, it can issue penalties in the form of manual actions. You can see if your site has a manual action issued against it, along with a description of each issue, in Google Search Console (GSC). To get Google to undo any penalties incurred with manual actions, you can request a review in your GSC Manual Actions report. You’ll need to describe and document all the steps you’ve taken to fix the issue. For SEO plagiarism, this might include rewriting sections of offending content. Reduced Content QualityPlagiarized content does not offer unique value to users. That means Google has no incentive to add it to its index or rank it in search results. Plus, plagiarized content is generally not as effective at generating engagement and conversions as original content.Because quality content is highly tailored to your target audience and brand identity—not someone else’s.SEO Plagiarism ToolsThe easiest way to detect SEO plagiarism is to use software.There are many SEO plagiarism checkers on the market.

If you wish to attempt to check for SEO plagiarism without using tools, you’ll need to be a careful reader and a patient researcher.Here are some techniques you can apply: Read carefully. Plagiarized content is often inconsistent in its grammar, syntax, and word choices. If you read content closely before publishing, you should be able to see if content has been copied from another source. Google suspicious sections. Sometimes, catching copied content is only a web search away. Use quotes to search for an exact phrase (for example, “Our analysis unearthed a curiously positive trend”). Cross-reference high-ranking pages. A Google search won’t pick up content-spinning plagiarism. But if you’re still not sure if your content contains plagiarized sections, read other high-ranking pages carefully.Preventing SEO Plagiarism: Best Practices to ConsiderTo prevent SEO plagiarism—and the consequences that can occur—you need to build originality into your content creation process. Here are some tips on how to do that.Cite Your SourcesIt’s far too easy to unintentionally borrow ideas and concepts and copy wording from other sources without acknowledgement. To help avoid this trap, you should require everyone who writes for your business to cite their sources. Advise your writers to take detailed notes during the research process. And be sure to check every quote and statistic for a citation before publication.Use AI Tools CarefullyOne of the biggest risks for accidental SEO plagiarism in your content today is generative AI. AI copywriting tools can provide large amounts of content in an instant and make the research and editorial process more efficient. But remember: AI tools are trained on public websites. As a result, the content they produce can trigger plagiarism detection tools. If you have incorporated AI into your content creation workflow, take extra care before you publish. One way to avoid these risks is to use AI copywriting tools with built-in SEO plagiarism checkers. Like Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant and the AI Writing Assistant.Vet Your WritersIf you’re working with freelance writers, make sure you do a thorough check of their work history first. Established freelance writers are much less likely to risk their reputation—and, potentially, their careers—by plagiarizing content. If you are working with new writers who have less work history, pay special attention to their first few pieces.And, make sure to share content writing best practices and brand writing style guidelines with them.We’ve covered preventing SEO plagiarism in your own work. In the section, we’ll run through your options if someone plagiarizes your content.Dealing with Stolen ContentIf you have found that someone has stolen your content, you should do your best to get them to take it down. This is because search engines can sometimes rank plagiarized content above original content.This is especially the case if Google considers the plagiarizing website to be of higher quality than your own. As Google’s John Mueller says:From my point of view, it [plagiarized content] is something that we can determine to a large extent. But even if we know which one is the original and which one is the copy, sometimes it makes sense to show a copy in the search results.To deal with stolen content, you have a range of options. We’ve listed them below, starting with the simplest. Contact the PublisherThe first thing to do to quickly remove stolen contact is to send a polite email to the publisher. The publisher may then remove the potentially plagiarized content.This resolves the issue and means you don’t spend time making formal requests.You can usually find contact information for a website in the “Copyright” or “Legal” sections of their website. Most websites are sensitive to potential copyright infringement due to potential monetary damages, so you should receive a response within two or three business days. If you can, be patient with smaller websites before you escalate, as they may not have processes in place to deal with requests.Contact GoogleIf contacting the publisher doesn’t work, you can submit a formal request through Google.The Report Content on Google tool is a simple form for reporting content that violates the law or Google’s terms and conditions.If Google finds the content to be illegal, it will remove it in those countries where it is illegal. If it violates Google’s terms and conditions, the content will be removed from the index globally. File a DMCA NoticeFor some forms of plagiarism, you can take legal action in the United States under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).The DMCA allows copyright owners to ask that plagiarized material is taken down from a website. You can file a DMCA takedown notice with the website’s web hosting company or a search engine. If you submit a DMCA request to Google, it will post this request publicly in its Transparency Report.How to File a DMCA NoticeBefore you file your DMCA notice, remember that you are required to swear to the facts. If you are found to be lying, you could face legal issues yourself.If you have found plagiarized content and wish to file a DMCA notice, you can follow the steps below.Note: This is not legal advice. We recommend consulting a legal professional before issuing a DMCA notice or pursuing legal action of any kind. Take a screenshot of the plagiarized content. Before you can submit your DMCA notice, you need to have proof of your claim. This should include both the infringing and source URLs. Prepare your DMCA notice. This is the formal notice requesting that the service provider or search engine removes the plagiarized content. The DMCA notice needs to include: Your contact information, including address, email, and phone number Identification of the work being infringed A statement indicating that you have a good faith belief that the use is unauthorized and violates your copyright A statement that you are the copyright owner or an authorized representative and that the information in the notice is accurate Your signature—electronic is fine Georgetown University has published a DMCA takedown notice template you can use. Send your notice. You’ll need to send your notice to the online platform's DMCA agent. This information should be available in the website’s copyright or legal sections. Review their response. If your DMCA notice is valid, the website will usually take down the infringing content. However, they may submit a counter-notification, which states that they do not believe your notice is valid. If you receive a counter-notification, the next step is to either drop your complaint or consider taking further legal action. The DMCA gives you 14 days to file a copyright infringement suit.If you have submitted a DMCA notice and the plagiarized material is still on the web with no counter-notice, the infringing party may lose safe harbor from copyright infringement liability. This means you may have the option of taking legal action. The DMCA says service providers must act “expeditiously,” though we recommend contacting a legal professional to figure out the options for your particular case. Take Legal ActionIn addition to the DMCA, there may be other legal options available to you, such as filing a lawsuit for copyright infringement. These options are sometimes expensive, and your options will depend on where you reside, where the content was published, and the resources you have. Again, we recommend consulting a legal professional to understand your rights and determine the best course of action.Build Originality Into Your SEO ContentCreating quality content is about so much more than avoiding SEO plagiarism.To learn more, check out the following resources: What Is Quality Content & How to Create It.
