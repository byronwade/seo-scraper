These usually have built-in tools for lead scoring, A/B testing, SEO, ecommerce, and more.A potential drawback is that you may end up paying for features you don't need. Also, all-in-one tools often involve a steep learning curve. So you may have to invest in employee training or outside help.That said, consider the following when choosing a marketing automation solution. Specialized vs. All-in-One ToolsSpecialized software can help with specific aspects of a marketing strategy, such as content creation or social media planning. All-in-one platforms, on the other hand, offer a wide range of tools with different uses.In general, all-in-one solutions are suitable for large enterprises. These have more complex needs than smaller companies and deal with large amounts of data. Plus, they have multiple teams and departments that collaborate on campaigns.With an all-in-one marketing platform, large enterprises can manage their data in a centralized location. They can also connect their existing CRM and ERP systems to the platform to gain a holistic view of their marketing efforts.But if you're a small or medium-sized business, you probably don't need all these bells and whistles. Think about what marketing tasks you want to automate. Then, choose a couple of tools accordingly.For instance, SEO automation tools can streamline competitor analysis, reporting, website monitoring, and other routine tasks. This will give you more time to fine-tune your SEO strategy and focus on revenue-generating activities. Features and CapabilitiesCheck your marketing stack to determine what you need help with.For example, you may want to automate repetitive tasks like posting on social media or sending out surveys. Or perhaps you're looking to automate specific workflows, such as cross-selling or upselling to potential customers.Also, think about which features are most important to you. These may include: User-friendly interface Clear navigation AI assistance Analytics and reporting Learning resources 24/7 customer supportScalabilityLook for digital marketing automation tools that can grow with your business. For instance, a scalable email marketing platform can handle increasing subscriber numbers. The best marketing automation tools usually include several subscription plans. Each plan targets companies in different stages of growth, from startups to enterprises with a large customer base. This means you can switch to a more compressive plan as your business evolves. Integration CapabilitiesSelect a marketing automation platform that integrates with your existing systems and apps.First, make sure it's compatible with your CRM—if you have one in place. Second, consider the following integrations, depending on which marketing tools you already use or plan to use soon: Email service provider (ESP) Ecommerce platform Live chat Enterprise resource marketing (ERP) system Accounting system Content management system Analytics appsWith these integrations, you'll create a single source for your data and unlock new capabilities.For instance, say you connect your CRM to an email marketing automation platform like Mailchimp.The two systems will continuously exchange data, leading to better insights into customer behavior. This allows for a higher degree of personalization, which can result in more effective email campaigns.Further reading: CRM Integration: What It Is, Why It Helps, and How to Do It PricingDigital marketing automation tools vary in price from $20 to $2,000+/month. The higher their complexity, the more you can expect to pay.However, many platforms include a free trial, so try them out before committing to a paid plan.Alternatively, start with free marketing automation tools like Zoho Campaigns, MailerLite, or SendPulse. These include a free basic plan with limited features, but you can upgrade later on.For instance, MailerLite's free plan appeals to solopreneurs with up to 1,000 subscribers. Users can send up to 12,000 monthly emails and have access to basic automation tools, like an email builder.NoteThe cost usually depends on the software's features, the number of users, and the size of your customer base. Check all pricing options to see what you'll pay if you exceed your plan's limits.
