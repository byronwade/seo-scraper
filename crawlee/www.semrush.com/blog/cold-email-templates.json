It doesn’t have to be that way.We put together 11 cold email templates that will save you time and help attract the leads your business wants most.How to Write a Cold Email That Actually Gets ResponsesBefore we dive into the pre-written cold email templates, let’s first understand what makes a great cold email. This way, you’ll know how to customize each template to ensure you get the best possible response.1. Research Your Recipient’s Pain PointsBefore crafting your cold email, thoroughly research your recipient’s pain points. Understand their unique challenges and struggles. Why?Because then you can include content that answers them.Dive into social media posts, explore relevant online forums, and stay up to date with industry news. Personalize your message in a way that resonates with their needs.2. Write a Short IntroductionYour email recipient is busy. So keep your intros short.Introduce who you are and what you do. Then, dive straight into the meat of your cold email.3. Personalize Your PitchYour recipient shouldn’t feel like they’re one of many people to get a cookie-cutter email. Take the below email: The recipient isn’t addressed by name, there’s no personal reference, and worst of all, the pitch isn’t relevant to the business.Make sure every email you send is unique. Customizing each one might take a few extra minutes, but it’s worth the effort.4. Define a Clear Value PropositionYour value proposition—how your offer benefits the email recipient—is crucial.Clearly state what the recipient gains from accepting your pitch. You’ll be most effective when you tie your value proposition to their pain points.For example: Let’s say you want a backlink from a blogger. That blogger’s biggest pain point might be driving traffic to their blog posts. A value proposition you include in your email could be an offer to share their blog post in your next newsletter. They’ll get more traffic in exchange for your ask. Bottom line: Help your recipient understand how they’ll benefit by helping you.5. Include a Strong Call to Action (CTA)By the time your recipient is done reading your email, it should be super clear what you need from them.Should they click a link? Book a time to meet? Email you back?Spell it out with a clear call to action (CTA).It helps if you include just one CTA. And make it super easy and simple for the recipient to do. If you want them to visit a landing page, provide just one link, not three. If you want to schedule a meeting, suggest a time and ask them to simply email back yes or no. This email asks the recipient to respond if they change a link:Make it as easy as possible for them to do what you ask.6. Finish With a Professional Email SignatureA well-designed email signature adds a professional touch to your cold email. It can also help you build trust and a human connection with the recipient. Increasing the chance of response.Include the following elements: Social media links Headshot Name and job title Business information and logo Contact detailsTo generate an email signature like this:7. Write a Compelling Subject LineYou want people to open your email. For that, you need a clear and compelling subject line.Here are a few tips: Keep your subject lines accurate (clickbait will irritate your recipient and might get your message marked as junk) Use around 45 characters—or less—to avoid truncation on mobile (this happens when the subject line is shortened due to space limitations) Make it personal by adding a name or referring to the industry your recipient works in Avoid spammy tactics like capitalized words or excessive exclamation points8. Review Your Email’s FormatMake sure your email is readable.Long paragraphs and large walls of text are overwhelming to read. Introduce white space by breaking up paragraphs and trimming long sentences. It makes emails feel more approachable and makes it easier for recipients to scan.11 Powerful Cold Email Templates You Can Use TodayNow that you know how to write a compelling cold email, let’s dive into our cold email templates.
