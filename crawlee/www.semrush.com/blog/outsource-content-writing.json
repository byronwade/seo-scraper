Identify Your GoalsFirst, determine why you want to outsource content writing. Setting goals for your content marketing strategy will help you identify the types of content you’ll need. For example, if your goal is to boost organic traffic, you might outsource these content types: SEO blog posts Evergreen content Guest posts Social media posts Email newsletters If you want to generate leads, you could outsource: Ebooks/white papers Press releases Product-focused blog posts Case studies Webinars Defining your goals ahead of time will also help you source the right talent. And effectively communicate assignments. Setting key performance indicators (KPIs) is important when outsourcing content writing. This can help ensure the work meets your expectations. And is contributing effectively to your business goals. Consider these KPIs: Engagement metrics: Track page views, time on page, and social shares SEO performance: Monitor keyword rankings, organic traffic, and backlinks Conversion metrics: Measure conversion rate and lead generation Customer feedback: Gather feedback through surveys, comments, and reviews Cost metrics: Calculate cost per article and ROI2. Determine the Type of Writer You NeedWriters come in all forms. Including: SEO writers: These writers create content to help websites and blogs rank in the search engine results pages (SERP) Technical writers: Instructions, documents, how-to manuals, and frequently asked questions. For example, a technical writer might create a step-by-step guide for implementing software. Copywriters: Sales specialists who create ad, web, and social media copy. To generate leads. Awareness. And sales. User experience (UX) writers: Content that guides the user experience. For example, UX writers might write instructions and tooltips for a software funnel. Email marketing writers: Emails, promotions, announcements, and offers Social media writers:These writers specialize in capturing an audience through platform-specific trends and features. Like leveraging hashtags and relevant lingo. Thought leadership writers: Content based on a unique point of view. To build authority in your niche. Thought leadership pieces can be used for sales, engagement, promotion, or even SEO. You’ll also want to consider skill level. Do you need an expert? Or is it a beginner-friendly topic that a newer writer can handle? This can affect your budget. As more experienced writers often charge more. 3. Select the Person Responsible for the Outsourcing ProcessOutsourcing generally frees up the time of your in-house team. But that doesn’t mean it’s a set-it-and-forget-it solution. Designate a lead for your outsourcing efforts. To handle these tasks: Content types and topics: Will you outsource blog posts, web copy, social media posts, or email marketing? What topics will you cover? Content briefs: Write briefs that outline what should and shouldn’t be included in the content Hire freelance talent: Post a job or source writers, vet talent, and manage the contracting process Manage communications: Oversee communications. From sending new assignments to answering questions about ongoing projects. Review/edit outsourced content: Review the quality of finished content. And request revisions if necessary. Develop processes and documentation: Write freelancer guidelines. And training materials.These tasks may fall on different team members. Depending on the size of your content operations. Communicative, organized, and detail-oriented team members are vital to outsourcing success. 4. Budget for Content OutsourcingOnce you’ve established your goals and how to measure them, it’s time to set a budget. Consider the following factors to determine an adequate budget: Will you use a content outsourcing platform that charges membership fees? Or commissions? Do you plan to pay by the word, the article, or the hour? Does the rate change based on the number of revisions? What level of experience do you want your freelancers to have? Do you need someone with specialized expertise? Note that this can affect your costs. For example, legal and medical writers may charge more.Thirty-four percent of businesses spend $1,000 to $5,000 on outsourced content each month. According to Semrush’s State of Content Ops and Outsourcing Report. Your budget will depend on the type of content you need. Writer expertise. And niche. Here’s an idea of what different freelance writers charge, according to Upwork: Technical writer: $20-$45 per hour Social media writer: $25-$40 per hour Content writer: $15-$40 per hour Copywriter: $19-$45 per hour SEO writer: $15-$35 per hour Grant writer: $35-65 per hour Blog writer: $15-35 per hour 5. Choose the Right Content Outsourcing PartnerThere are different ways to outsource content writing.Options include:FreelancersThis is one of the most common methods of outsourcing writing tasks. There are a number of freelancing platforms (more on that later) where you can find talented writers. But you also can reach out to freelancers directly. On sites like LinkedIn. Here’s how: Search “freelancer,” “freelance writer,” or “freelance + [niche]” on LinkedIn to find potential candidates. NoteYou can only message your first-degree connections for free on LinkedIn. As you find writers you’re interested in working with who aren’t in your network, send them a connection request. With a brief message explaining your project. Otherwise, pay for a LinkedIn membership to message non-connections.Alternatively, post ads for freelance writing jobs on popular boards like: All Things Freelance Writing Freelance Writing Gigs Superpath ProBloggerHiring freelancers is a good option for companies of all sizes. It allows you to negotiate contracts and rates with freelancers directly.AgenciesContent marketing agencies offer extensive content marketing solutions. If you have the budget but lack the internal team, a content agency can take ownership of your content marketing efforts. Content marketing agencies can often handle all aspects of content creation. Including: Content strategy Outlines Content briefs Writing Editing Writer management Performance trackingMany agencies can act as a third-party marketing team if needed. Others may only offer writing services. Determine your needs and find an agency to match. Content MillsContent mills, also called content farms, focus on quantity over quality. These platforms employ freelancers to produce mass quantities of content. If you need a large amount of non-specialized content, this is an affordable approach. The downside is that you usually can’t handpick your freelancers. Or find writers with niche expertise. Because content mills tend to be more affordable, the writers are also usually paid less. This means many freelance writers are just starting their careers when they work for content mills. All of this generally means you get less experienced and less specialized writers. Niche ExpertsIf expertise is what you’re after, focus on finding niche experts. This can help you produce high-quality content written by industry specialists. But you’ll need to budget accordingly. According to the Editorial Freelancers Association, medical freelance writers make $82.50 to $110.00 per hour. While non-specialized, work-for-hire writers make $50 to $79 per hour. If you can commit the time and money, finding an expert writer can positively impact your content beyond how well it’s researched. It can also help you demonstrate E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness). Which is part of Google’s framework for assessing content quality. (Not a part of its algorithms, but an essential directive given to human search quality evaluators who work for Google.) This is especially important for “Your Money or Your Life” (YMYL) topics. Like finance, medical, and health-related topics. If you publish YMYL topics, it could be worth budgeting more for highly experienced writers. 6. Vet Writers with Test AssignmentsWhether you require a test assignment is up to you. The writer may have enough relevant examples in their portfolio that you feel confident hiring them on the spot.In some cases, it may still be helpful to ask writers to complete a writing test. Before hiring them for a project. NoteIf you hire a content marketing agency or content mill, they may provide a test assignment for free to ensure it’s a match. Inquire about test assignments before signing a contract. Or paying for a subscription.Keep the test short. And consider compensating writers for the work. This can help increase the quality of candidates you receive.The test should measure the freelancer’s writing abilities. Like grammar, spelling, and logical flow. And also reflect your content needs. For example: If you’re looking for niche expertise, ask them to incorporate industry knowledge into a test article If you’re looking for an SEO writer, ask them to incorporate keywords into a test article and format anchor text Provide specific instructions. Like word count, keywords, brand voice, subjects to address, and links to include. This will help you gauge how well they follow direction. And if they’re a fit for your brand. 7. Establish Communication and WorkflowEstablish your outsourcing workflow early in the process. So your outsourcing lead and your freelancers have a smooth system in place. Create a content calendar: Your content calendar should outline all your upcoming content. And designate what should be outsourced. Establish your communication flow: This includes deciding which team member manages freelancer communications. And setting a cadence for those communications. Set deadlines: Set deadlines for drafts and revisions. And make them clear to your outsourcing partner. Depending on the scope of the content, deadlines may be anywhere from one week to one month. Define your invoicing process: Ensure freelancers know when and how to submit invoices. And when those invoices will be paid. Ideally, these processes will be clearly outlined in your contracts. 8. Consider Legal and Contractual MattersTo protect your company and respect your freelance talent, draw up a contract. And make sure someone with legal expertise and credentials reviews it.Generally, an outsourced writing contract should include: Description of services: What type of content they’ll write. And what website they’ll write for. Expectations: Production expectations. Like the number of articles required. And word count. Payment terms: Rates, how often they’ll be paid, and when and how you’ll send payments Rights: Who has ownership rights over the content Attribution details: Whether the writer will have an author byline on content they produce. And what information that byline will include. Like whether they can link to their own website in their byline. Terms and conditions: Confidentiality agreement, non-disclosure agreements, non-compete terms, contract termination terms, and other applicable terms and conditions To ensure you include the right terms and clauses, consult your legal team or use an online contract service. Once your contract is set, get signatures from relevant parties before you begin outsourcing work. 9. Generate Topic IdeasWhether you hire freelancers or a content agency, you or someone on your team will likely need to provide the content ideas. To identify content ideas, use Semrush’s Topic Research tool. Open the tool, enter a topic idea, and click “Get content ideas.”For this example, let’s say you need content for a pet grooming website.The tool will generate various ideas related to pet grooming. Click on an idea to see more details. Including “Subtopic Volume.” This is the keyword search volume—the estimated number of Google users searching this term each month. Higher Subtopic Volume indicates more interest in that topic. Build out your content calendar using the ideas you generate with Topic Research. To ensure you cover all relevant topics. And then assign them to writers. Based on expertise. 10. Create a Detailed Content BriefA content brief is a document that communicates expectations to the freelancer. Pro tipUse our SEO Content Template to automatically generate content templates based on your target keyword. You’ll get recommendations for length, semantically related keywords, readability, and more. Content briefs should include the following: The goal of the content: The goal of the content may be to teach the audience about a topic. Or sell a product. Include this information in your brief. So the freelance writer can use the appropriate tone of voice. And include the necessary information. What keywords you’re targeting: Include your primary keyword. And secondary keywords if applicable. Use the Keyword Magic Tool to identify what keywords you should target. What stage of the funnel you’re trying to reach: Is the aim of this specific page to bring in new customers? Upsell customers engaged in the buying process? Or appeal to your established base of customers? Brand voice: Link to your style guide. And any other relevant documentation that can guide a freelancer on adhering to brand voice. Links, statistics, or products: Include specific information. Like internal links, external links, products, or study findings. That you want the writer to include. Your competition: List competing websites or brands the writer should avoid linking to in the content. And include competitor links to top ranking articles for the same topic. Approved sources: Include sources the writer should link to. Like government or educational websites. Or certain subject-matter authorities within your niche. Examples of relevant content: Provide examples of relevant content on your site or related sites that the writer should emulate Visuals you want the writer to include: Mention any images, whether they’re in-house infographics or images from an external source, the writer should include in their work. 11. Implement Quality Control and Feedback MechanismsReview outsourced content to ensure it matches your style guide, quality standards, and goals.This can be done by an in-house editor. Or outsourced to an editing partner. Or freelance editor.Use third-party content editing tools to assess SEO potential and grammar. For example, use Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant to analyze drafts for readability, SEO, originality, and tone of voice.And use tools like Grammarly to quickly review a freelancer’s writing mechanics. Many of these tools offer free browser plugins. So you can easily run a review on a Google Doc to catch grammar and spelling mistakes. If the content is on a niche subject, consider having an expert review it for accuracy. If your article is product or industry-specific, ask a relevant team member to review it. This can help keep quality high. No matter who writes your content. Request RevisionsFollow these best practices to get the most out of revision requests: Clearly state revision requirements while hiring. Including how many rounds of revisions you require. Get feedback from relevant team members before sending revision requests to the writer Be mindful of word count. For example, if you ask the writer to add another section, it may increase the word count enough that you need to pay more. Depending on your contract’s payment terms. Be specific with your feedback Give examples of what you are looking for Provide actionable tips. To help the writer provide the desired result. Incorporate Feedback The best way to produce quality outsourced work is to tell your freelancers what is and isn’t working. Incorporate feedback into your revision requests that explain any issues. And how the writer should approach them the next time. Compliment what they’re doing well. So they know to keep doing it.If you’re noticing frequent problems with the quality of content you’re receiving, try Creating training materials for freelancers to work through before they start their first assignment Revisiting freelancer guidelines to ensure they adequately detail expectations Revising content briefs for thoroughness Switching freelancer platforms or outsourcing services Improving your freelancer vetting system Offering incentives for high-quality work12. Track Your Content's SuccessOnce your content is published, start tracking results. Use Google Analytics to monitor traffic and engagement.Look at data like: Search traffic Conversions Time on page Click-through-rate (CTR) Bounce rateAnalyze your top-performing content.
