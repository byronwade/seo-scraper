So how do we create videos that work? How do we use videos in ads to engage and drive action? Types of Video Ads on YouTubeDifferent ad types on YouTtube appear in different placements, so consider tailoring your content accordingly. YouTube’s video ad types include: TrueView AdsTrueView ads are the most common ad type on Youtube. They work best for brands that want to reach as many people as possible.

They have a time limit of 6 seconds, giving you even less time to communicate your message. However, viewers are less likely to disengage from a bumper ad. Videos that are intriguing or quirky do better in this placement.Overlay AdsOverlay ads are banner ads that appear along the bottom of YouTube videos. They’re meant to reach a relevant audience that is already engaging a topic similar to the ads. However, your audience might consider them intrusive, and they don’t offer much space to convey your message.

Show someone completing their to-do list after drinking your coffee, or show a user speeding through their grocery trip with your new shopping app. 3.
