Then you need digital advertising in your marketing mix.This guide explains what it is, why it’s important, and how to get started.What Is Digital Advertising?Digital advertising refers to online ads delivered through digital channels such as search engines, social media, websites, and mobile apps.The goal of digital ads is often to reach your target audience and influence them to take a specific action. Like signing up for a newsletter or making a purchase.This is different from the traditional advertising we’ve all been exposed to for decades.Traditional Advertising vs. Digital AdvertisingTraditional advertising is the old-school way of reaching audiences through offline media like TV, radio, newspapers, and magazines. It’s usually expensive and hard to measure.Digital advertising is the modern way of reaching audiences. And has become more important than traditional advertising for many companies. Let’s see why.Why Is Digital Advertising Important?Digital advertising is important because it allows you to connect with your target audience in ways that traditional media channels don’t.Think about it—digital platforms together have billions of users. So you can get your brand and message in front of a huge audience, beyond just local markets.You also get the benefit of advanced targeting capabilities—you can zero in on specific user demographics, interests, and behaviors to serve your ads to just your ideal customers.Traditional advertising methods don’t allow for the same level of precision.On top of this, digital ads don’t require a heavy advertising budget. You can get started with just a few hundred dollars and scale up from there.Plus, digital ads make it far easier for you to track progress, measure and attribute results, and improve on your marketing campaigns as you go.Types of Digital AdvertisingDigital advertising comes in many different forms. Below, we’ve listed some of the major types and provided some specific digital ad examples.Search AdsSearch ads are text-based ads that appear in search engine results when people look for relevant keywords and phrases.Here’s an example:Now, if anyone clicks on this ad, the advertiser (in this case, booking.com) pays Google a small fee.

Understand Your AudienceFirst, you need to gain a deep understanding of your target audience.This allows you to craft ads with relevant messaging and choose the best platforms to run them on.Use Semrush’s One2Target tool to learn about your target audience.Open the tool, enter up to five competitors’ websites, and click “Analyze.”(Don’t worry that this is based on competitors. Their audiences reflect your target audience’s characteristics.)You’ll see a lot of different information.For example, the “Demographics” tab shows you the different age brackets your audience falls into and what their gender breakdown looks like.This can help you tailor your ad language and tone to resonate with specific segments.For instance, you may use more youthful language and visuals if the audience skews younger.The “Socioeconomics” tab reveals your audience’s household size, income level, etc.This information helps you craft ads that highlight products and/or services that make sense for their income levels and household needs.And the “Behavior” tab provides insights into where your audience spends time online. And what social media platforms they use. Place your ads on those sites and platforms for the best visibility with your target audience.2. Set GoalsThe next step is to set clear goals for your campaigns.Specifically, decide exactly what you want to achieve with your advertising campaigns and by when. To give your advertising campaigns direction.Consider mapping out all this information: Goal: What you exactly you want to achieve Deadline: When you want to achieve results Metrics: How you’ll measure whether you were successful Critical success factors: A step-by-step overview of what needs to happen to achieve your goal3. Choose Your Advertising MixOnce your goals are clear, the next step is to create a plan of action. And determine which advertising options you’re going to use.Search ads? Social media ads? Display ads? Video ads? Affiliate marketing?Decide this based on your target audience, campaign objectives, and budget considerations.For example, leveraging video ads on platforms like YouTube and TikTok could be effective if your goal is to increase brand awareness among a younger demographic.But if your goal is focused on lead generation, search ads and affiliate marketing may allow you to reach people who are more ready to engage.How you allocate budget across different channels is also important.For instance, you may run YouTube ads, Facebook ads, and Google search ads. With search ads receiving the largest budget allocation due to its strong lead gen capabilities.Consider all these factors. So you can create a solid digital advertising plan.4. Measure Campaign ResultsWhen running campaigns, you need to track metrics to measure your performance.This helps you identify areas for improvement. Some common metrics to look at include: Return on ad spend (ROAS): the revenue generated from all your advertising expenditure Cost per impression (CPM): the cost per thousand impressions (or views) Click-through rate (CTR): the ratio of clicks to impressions for your ad Cost per click (CPC): the cost you paid when someone clicked on your ad Conversion rate: the percentage of people who take a desired action (i.e., make a purchase or download a brochure) Engagement rate: the percentage of people who engage with your ad in some way relative to the number of impressions it receivedThe specific metrics you’ll evaluate depend on your goals and what types of ads you’re running.Digital Advertising Tools to Improve Your CampaignsDigital advertising tools are helpful for managing and optimizing your campaigns based on data.Here’s a roundup of the best tools:PPC Advertising ToolkitSemrush’s PPC Advertising Toolkit helps you plan, manage, and optimize your digital advertising campaigns.
