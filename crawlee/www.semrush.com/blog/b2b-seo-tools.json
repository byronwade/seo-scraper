  "content": "Business-to-business (B2B) SEO is about more than just climbing rankings. You do it for visibility to connect with the business owners, decision-makers, and industry professionals who need your product or service.In this niche where precision is key, the following B2B SEO tools will help you boost productivity, brand awareness, and conversion rates.1. SemrushSemrush is a comprehensive online marketing platform with over 55 helpful tools and reports.Its SEO toolkit has four main workflow groups: Competitive Research Keyword Research Link Building On-Page and Technical SEOFollowing the toolkit’s flow will help you cover all bases of your B2B website’s SEO.Some of the best SEO tools to start with are Traffic Analytics, Keyword Magic, On Page SEO Checker, and Persona.Here’s how they work:Traffic AnalyticsTraffic Analytics provides insights into your competitors’ SEO and other marketing efforts, showing where they get traffic from and which tactics are paying off.You can use that to fill gaps in your strategy, get content ideas, and ultimately improve your rankings.Enter a site’s URL into the search box and click “Analyze.”You’ll get an analysis of their traffic, visits duration, bounce rate, and more.It’s a user-friendly way to find any domain’s top-performing pages, traffic channels, and audience profiles.Cost: Full access to Traffic Analytics data is available with the .Trends package at $289/month. You can add it to any Business, Guru, or Pro Semrush subscription.Keyword Magic ToolThe Keyword Magic Tool is your window into Semrush’s database of 25.1 billion keywords. Give it one seed keyword (i.e., a broad term related to your business or product) and it’ll generate thousands of keyword variations for you to research in more depth.To start, type your seed keyword into the search box, choose a location, and click “Search.”You’ll see a list of keyword ideas. And plenty of metrics to help you determine which ones warrant further research. Like search volume, search intent, and keyword difficulty (KD) scores.Rearrange the list in ascending or descending order by clicking any of the metrics along the top.For example, you could click “Volume” and then identify keywords near the top of the list with low keyword difficulty scores. Targeting high-traffic keywords with low difficulty scores can help you rank in the search engine results pages (SERPs) faster.Clicking on any of the keywords will take you to the Keyword Overview page, where you can see the top 100 ranking pages for the selected keyword and where you can toggle between country databases to compare metrics quickly.You can use this detail to build a list of priority keywords in the Keyword Strategy Builder for your SEO strategy.Cost: Available with a Free, Pro ($139.95/month), Guru ($249.95/month), or Business ($499.95/month) Semrush account.On Page SEO CheckerSemrush’s On Page SEO Checker evaluates your content and suggests search-friendly improvements in real time.Enter your landing pages and keywords to get an exhaustive list of ideas like: Optimizing meta tags Improving user experience (UX) Verifying content readabilityYou can also speed up the SEO auditing process by importing data from Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and Semrush’s Site Audit tool.To use the On Page SEO Checker, choose an existing project from the list:Or to create a new one, click “+ Create project,” add your URL and Project Name, and head back to the list to select “Set up.”The tool will ask for your target location and which pages you want to optimize. Choose those and click “Collect ideas.”You’ll see a dashboard containing a range of ideas and optimization recommendations.Click any of the numbers in the “Total Ideas” panel to see a list of relevant pages.Click any of the blue “ideas” buttons to explore the tool’s suggestions for that page. So if we choose “Backlinks Ideas,” we see a list of pages on our site for which the tool has backlink recommendations.Based on competitor data, the tool recommends sites to acquire backlinks from.That’s helpful since backlinks are one of Google’s most important ranking signals.Alternatively, we can choose a page from the Overview’s list of “TOP pages to optimize.”Just click on any of the blue “ideas” buttons to see a full list of on-page SEO recommendations for that URL.You’ll see recommendations around SEO “Strategy,” “SERP Features,” “Content,” and more.Pay particularly close attention to the tool’s content recommendations. For instance, you may find that you have too many keywords in your content—or too few. The tool can identify issues and opportunities for improving your content based on your competition. Which can improve your overall strategy. In fact, McKinsey found that B2B businesses can see a 5-10% increase in revenue from increasing their content’s relevance and engagement.Cost: On Page SEO Checker is accessible with all Semrush accounts, though each tier has limits: Free: 10 SEO Idea Units (each keyword in the tool spends 1 unit) Pro: 500 SEO Idea Units Guru: 800 SEO Idea Units Business: 2,000 SEO Idea UnitsPersonaSemrush’s Persona tool can help you build a buyer persona in minutes. A buyer persona is a hypothetical representation of your ideal customer based on data from market research, competitor analysis, and existing customer profiles.The tool comes with several B2B-specific templates. And provides questions and prompts to inspire you as you build your profiles.By creating accurate, in-depth personas in Semrush, you can tailor your SEO content to resonate with specific decision-makers online.Start by choosing a profile image. Pick the one that most closely resembles your typical customer.Then, pick a template—such as the B2B template.Now, enter the abstract buyer’s details into the various tiles. And add custom tiles if anything’s missing.Having a template to work with ensures you don’t forget any important details when building your B2B buyer personas.Cost: Free.Helpful B2B SEO features (across Semrush): Discover untapped keyword opportunities in minutes (Keyword Magic Tool) Crawl pages to detect technical issues impacting SEO (Site Audit) Crawl pages to find ideas to improve SEO based on top-ranking competitors (On Page Checker) Find B2B-specific templates to speed up SEO processes (Persona)User review (Semrush): “I love that Semrush offers a pretty complete package for an SEO campaign. It offers in-depth insight into anything from backlink metrics to keyword performance. It’s also great for scoping out new opportunities for new business or pitching, by giving top-level estimated performance metrics about almost any website”—Chris C., SEO Specialist [via G2]2. Google (GSC, GA4, PageSpeed Insights)Google’s search and website performance toolkit provides a wealth of data to help you make more fruitful SEO decisions.Its three main tools are Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and PageSpeed Insights.Here’s what you need to know:Google Analytics 4 (GA4)Google Analytics 4 shows you how people find and use your website. And how it performs in paid (i.e., pay-per-click advertising (PPC) and organic search.Its information is crucial for measuring your B2B SEO strategy’s effectiveness. And the impact of smaller on-page SEO tweaks.You’ll find insightful data on: Users Sessions Page engagement Traffic sourcesYou can use GA reports to understand the impact of your SEO activities, fix inefficiencies, and repeat winning actions.Cost: Free.Google Search ConsoleGoogle Search Console (GSC), formerly Webmaster Tools, monitors how your website performs on Google’s SERPs. And it helps you fix indexing and crawling issues that hinder your search performance.GSC’s accessible reports make technical search and SEO data easier to understand. They’re ideal for business owners with limited B2B marketing or analytics experience. The reports are also easily shareable, so you can keep team members and stakeholders up to date.Submitting sitemaps and individual URLs for GSC to crawl helps Google see, understand, and rank your site. The faster it understands your sitemap, the faster you can get high-quality content in front of your target audience on Google.Cost: Free.PageSpeed InsightsPageSpeed Insights assesses your website on a technical level and suggests ways to increase its performance. When your site loads faster, it improves the UX and can boost your ranking potential.The tool gauges the performance of any URL using metrics it calls Core Web Vitals. This tells you if the site is likely to meet visitor expectations—like whether pages load fast enough and whether links are responsive.Only one-third of websites pass the Core Web Vitals threshold. So, working toward a pass could help you outperform others in your field.Whether your site passes or not, PageSpeed Insights will offer recommendations for improving site performance.You’ll see verdicts and suggestions for mobile and desktop sites—ideal for reaching business owners on various devices.Cost: Free.Helpful B2B SEO features (across GA, GSC, and PageSpeed Insights): Segmentation for analyzing high-value site traffic Goal conversion tracking for quantifying SEO return on investment (ROI) Index coverage reports to diagnose content issuesUser review (GSC): “The best thing about [GSC] is that it saves me hours and days’ worth of time by telling me which keywords I need to work on so that my rankings boost in a few days. With this tool, I’ve been able to increase my website’s clicks from 400/month to 48,000/month in two years.”—Shivam A, content manager at AiSensy [via G2]Further reading: We explore GSC, GA, PageSpeed Insights, and more in our Guide to Google SEO Tools3.

Bing Webmaster ToolsBing Webmaster Tools is the Microsoft version of GSC. It offers many of the same metrics (e.g., click-through rates (CTRs), impressions, keyword rankings) but in relation to Bing rather than Google.Why use both of these marketing tools?Google dominates search, but Bing still has over 100 million active daily users.
