For example, the suggested keyword “how to start a youtube channel for beginners” indicates searchers want tips for YouTube newcomers.You can analyze the search intent of this query by looking at the words within it.The words “how to” indicate the searcher wants a guide or tutorial. “For beginners” means they want step-by-step guidance tailored specifically for newcomers to YouTube.

Including “simple reliable gear for starting a youtube channel” and “best equipment to buy for starting a youtube channel.”These are long-tail variations (highly specific search terms) of the keyword that could be relevant for your audience. Analyzing these keywords can give you ideas for more targeted content around starting a YouTube channel.Pro tip: You can track your channel’s performance for your target keywords with Rank Tracker for YouTube.With Keyword Analytics for YouTube, you can uncover insights such as: Search volume Keywords by country Keyword popularity trends Top videos related to trending keywords The most popular keywords on YouTube by day, week, or monthThese insights can help you to make data-driven decisions to help you create content that will better resonate with your audience.What We LikeThe “Competitive Rate” score (pictured on the right side of the below image) allows you to better understand whether a keyword is worth targeting. The score is out of 100. And a lower score means fewer content creators are targeting that keyword. So, a channel with fewer than 1 million subscribers has a better chance of ranking high in YouTube search results for a keyword with a score of 20 than for a keyword with a score of 80.PricingSemrush’s Keyword Analytics for YouTube costs $10 per month. A seven-day free trial is also available.2. Rank Tracker for YouTubeThe Rank Tracker for YouTube lets you see where your videos rank in YouTube search results.

Google TrendsGoogle Trends is typically used to see the popularity of Google search queries in real time. But you can also use it to find trends in YouTube searches.How does it work?Enter a keyword into the search bar and click “Explore”:Once in the tool, select the drop-down menu that says “Web Search” and change it to “YouTube Search”:In the time period drop-down menu, select “2008 - present” to view keyword trends for the full available date range:And you’ll get a graph showing the keyword’s popularity over time. Peaks show times of high interest. Low points show times with less interest.For example, searches for “how to start a youtube channel” peaked in May of 2020.You can also compare multiple search terms by clicking “+ Add comparison” and entering another keyword. For example, “how to start a youtube channel” versus “how to become an influencer” looks like this:Comparing keywords shows their relative popularity over time. And can tell you which keyword has historically been more popular for YouTube searchesThese insights can help you make more informed keyword choices. For example, the comparison above shows that: Searches for “how to start a youtube channel” are more popular than “how to become an influencer” Interest in “how to become an influencer” has been slowly rising since May 2022 Interest in “how to start a youtube channel” declined but rose rapidly in May 2022Knowing this could suggest that “how to start a youtube channel” is likely a better keyword to target right now. And that viewers have a growing interest in content about becoming a YouTuber in general (meaning beyond just YouTube).Google Trends can also help uncover additional YouTube keyword opportunities to expand your research. Related queries: Discover other keywords (including “Breakout” ones that have recently seen a 5,000% increase in search volume) people search for that are relevant to your keyword. This can uncover keyword ideas you may have missed. Related topics: Identify related topics people who entered your search term also searched forWhat We LikeGoogle Trends can help you understand how a search query’s popularity has changed over time. And determine whether a topic has peaked or is still worth covering.For example, interest in the search query “how to start a youtube channel” in the United States peaked in popularity during 2016:But you can see from the same chart that it’s starting to gain momentum again:This feature helps you identify topics that are rising in popularity. So you can create content while interest is on the rise (or avoid topics that are on the decline). PricingGoogle Trends is a free YouTube keyword tool.4. YouTube Search PredictionsYou can use the autocomplete function on YouTube (officially called search predictions) as a keyword suggestion tool. Because it displays suggested search queries as soon as you start typing into the search bar. It uses a combination of factors like the popularity of search terms and your past searches to generate suggestions. You’ll get more specific terms as you enter more words into the bar. For example, if you enter “youtube channel” into the search bar you may see broad search terms such as “youtube channel ideas” or “youtube channel tips”:But if you enter “how to start a youtube channel,” you may get specific searches such as “how to start a youtube channel without showing your face” or “how to start a youtube channel for beginners with a phone.”The more specific search terms that YouTube suggests provide insights into the different angles and subtopics people are interested in related to your broader topic.Knowing these specific keyword variations and subtopics allows you to create content that caters to what people are searching for.What We LikeYouTube’s autocomplete function reflects what users are currently searching for. This means you're getting insight into what YouTube audiences are interested in right now.For example, if you enter “how to start a youtube channel,” you may notice the search query “how to start a youtube channel without showing your face”:It may be worth creating a video around this topic if your channel focuses on helping people getting started on YouTube.And the suggested searches you see will evolve over time based on user behavior. So, regularly re-checking the suggested searches for your core keywords provides visibility into which related topics are gaining or declining in popularity. This allows you to continually update your YouTube content strategy to align with the search terms viewers are using.PricingYouTube search predictions is a free feature.5. YouTube’s Trending PageAlthough not explicitly designed for it, the YouTube Trending page can be a valuable keyword research tool. Because it helps you find popular topics.The default dashboard gives you an overview of the top trending YouTube videos and Shorts right now:The trending YouTube videos and Shorts are the same in every country. So, it’s not personalized. And you might see videos in other languages, too.The Trending list updates about every 15 minutes.
