  "content": "Google has a suite of free tools, tests, and reports to help site owners and SEO professionals analyze and improve their website’s search performance.We’ll cover the eight best Google SEO tools so you know what they do and how and why to use them. 1. Google Search Console for Technical SEOGoogle Search Console (GSC) is a free SEO tool that allows you to track your site’s health and performance. You use it to help improve your visibility and ranking in the search engine results pages (SERPs).For example: You could use it to track metrics that detail your search traffic changes. That way, you know which strategies are working and which aren’t.Here’s what one of your reports could look like:You want to improve these numbers to get more organic traffic from Google. Because more traffic means more leads and conversions. In other words, more sales and signups.As a byproduct, you may find it gets you more traffic on Bing and other search engines, too.What You Can Use Google Search Console ForYou can use Google Search Console to: Understand how your site is performing on Google Review the pages that Google can already find and index Submit your sitemap and individual URLs for crawling and indexing Identify technical SEO issues to optimize your websiteTo set up GSC, sign in to Search Console with your Google account. The first time you log in, you’ll see this pop-up:Choose between two options: Add a domain or a URL prefix. Follow the steps in our guide to understand each route in more detail.Next, you can connect GSC to your SEO dashboard. You’ll see this interactive graph showing total clicks, total impressions, average click-through-rate (CTR), and average ranking position:That way, you can access your site’s relevant SEO metrics and insights in one central location.2. Google Analytics for Website PerformanceGoogle Analytics 4 (GA4) is a free analytics platform that tracks your site or app’s performance. Think metrics like bounce rate or dwell time.You can use these analytics reports to better inform your digital marketing efforts and SEO priorities.Here’s what your GA4 dashboard could look like, with metrics such as new users and event count:Note: This screenshot is from a demo account you can access here.If Google Search Console is search engine-focused, Google Analytics is user-focused. The metrics will reveal how easy your site is to navigate. In other words, it gauges the quality of its user experience (UX).What You Can Do with Google AnalyticsGoogle Analytics works in three stages: It collects your website data It processes that data It generates a reportUse these data-driven reports to spot problems and inform future SEO decisions. How?One way is to understand which pages are bringing in the most traffic. Then, refine the process when adding new pages.Log in to your Google account, then head to the Google Analytics homepage. Click “Get started today” in the top right corner.Follow the steps in our guide to complete the next three sections and create your GA account. This will differ depending on your content management system (e.g., WordPress).Once you’re done, you can access all your important site metrics like new users and average engagement time.Now, head over to another of the best SEO tools out there:Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker. As with GSC, you can add Google Analytics to your SEO Dashboard to view all your metrics in one place.Integrate GA to leverage insights and spot potential page or UX issues. Or get in-depth advice for updating your on-page content, title tags, and internal links.Further reading: Learn about the tags you need for GA to collect data using Google Tag Manager.Let’s look at how you can improve on-page content to benefit your UX.Start by configuring the On Page SEO Checker for your site.

Google Business Profile for Local SEOGoogle Business Profile (GBP) is a free local SEO tool that influences your company’s appearance on Google Search, Maps, and Shopping. What Can GBP Do?Use your GBP to: Increase local visitors (thanks to higher SERP visibility) Get more reviews to gain credibility Share business information with customersHere’s an example of local Google search results:And this is what a GBP looks like:Companies with complete and optimized GBPs are more likely to appear in results that include phrases like “where to buy” and “near me.”The search engine can pull this information from your profile to show to relevant searchers.GBPs are essential for customer-facing businesses, whether or not they have physical storefronts.Why?Customers who find complete GBPs are 2.7x more likely to consider a business reputable.

But it does indicate factors that affect SEO. For example, page speed and page experience. The higher your score, the faster and more efficient your site is. Which means it’s more likely to have a positive impact on your search rankings.To see your score, go to Google’s PageSpeed Insights.

Google Keyword Planner for Keyword ResearchGoogle Keyword Planner is a free keyword research tool. It’s technically for pay-per-click (PPC) advertising.

Click “Start now” on the Ads homepage.Follow the easy steps in our guide to complete the setup.The keyword research process helps you understand your niche and target audience better. Using relevant search terms in your content means you’re more likely to attract qualified traffic to your site.Without keyword research, you might target search terms no one is using. Limiting your organic traffic as a result.What Can You Do With Google Keyword Planner?You have two options when using the tool: “Discover new keywords” to find ideas for specific keywords “Get search volume and forecasts” to look at existing keywords and analyze search volumes, historical metrics, and forecastsThere are several routes you can take from here. Some relate to keywords you suggest (e.g., “Inter Miami” in the soccer example above). Others relate to a particular website you input.Say you want relevant keywords for running shoes.Enter “running shoes” into the search bar. You’ll get a list of brand-related keywords.Not all of these will be relevant to your business. Use the “Refine keywords” column on the right to filter your list.This narrows down your suggested keywords by attributes such as brand, type of shoe, and sport.Ready to take your research further? Use Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool for a deeper SEO-based process.Pro tip: Create a free Semrush account and get 10 free daily searches.Open Keyword Magic Tool and enter a phrase that relates to your business. We’ll use “surfboards” for this example.Click “Search.”A list of related keywords will be displayed.Use the column on the left to narrow your results by topic.Click the eye icon next to an irrelevant result to hide it. Here, we’ll eliminate “Arris” and “Motorola”—“surfboards” in these cases refers to modem/router combos.Clicking “review” will display the results that include the term.The “KD” column indicates keyword difficulty. The lower the number, the easier the keywords will be to rank for. Highly specific search queries with low search volumes such as these review-related ones are known as long-tail keywords.Keyword Magic Tool lets you click to filter them from easiest to hardest.You could write a review of the brands of surfboards you sell. Or create a video comparing two or three of them.This strategy can pull in new potential customers over time.

More than 70% of shoppers use their phones to buy online. Your site must cater to this growing segment of internet users.If users struggle to access it on their mobile devices, they may leave.

Rich Results Test for Enhanced SERP ResultsRich Results Test is a free Google tool for SEO that ensures you’re set up to rank as a rich snippet in the SERPs. A “rich snippet” is a search result that shows additional information. Here’s an example:Instead of plain text, Google includes an image, rating, vote count, and time estimate.Use Google’s Rich Results Test to set up your structured data correctly. So the search engine can pull this information.Simply paste a URL into the tool’s search bar and click “Test URL.”Under the “Detected Structured Data” section, the tool will show you what it found.See a warning? Click on it for more details.You’ll see invalid items that need fixing. Some “missing fields” are optional, but we recommend adding them to ensure you’re set up for rich snippets. Our structured data shows the “name” field is missing on our recipe page. Fixing it will require adding one and specifying the recipe’s name in our code.Going through this process gives you the best chance of ranking as a rich snippet. However, Google doesn’t guarantee it.Google’s algorithm aims to show the most useful, relevant content to searchers. Sometimes, a text result may be more appropriate.You can also combine the Site Audit tool with the Rich Results Test to uncover structured data and rich snippet issues.On your Semrush dashboard, click “View details” under “Markup.”You’ll see your site’s pages divided into “with markup” and “no markup.” It will also tell you how many have invalid structured data.At the bottom of the report, click “View all invalid items” under the “Structured Data Items” widget.Click the tag button to open and test each page in Google’s Rich Results Test tool.The test will start automatically. Be prepared to wait a minute or two.Next, view your results.Valid results are eligible to feature as rich snippets.
