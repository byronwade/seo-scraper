They are also more likely to generate links and shares.Use the listicle content template to write your own.4. ChecklistsA checklist is an exhaustive list that helps readers achieve or prepare for something.

Here are six content ideation techniques to help you out:1. Research Competing BlogsOther blogs’ ideas for content in your niche can be a valuable source of inspiration. You can find competitors’ blogs yourself using Google. Then have a look around and see what inspires you.However, it is useful to know which posts are most popular with readers. Semrush’s Organic Research tool will give you that information.Just enter a competitor’s blog domain (e.g., blogname.com) or subfolder (e.g., website.com/blog).Then choose a location and click “Search.”Then, head over to the “Pages” tab to see their most visited URLs. (The results are sorted by estimated Google traffic, from high to low.)In this example, one of the most visited pages is about bee identification. If you were a gardening blogger, you might add this to your list of blog post ideas.You can click on the URL to get more data. (Such as its keyword rankings in Google and estimated traffic.) Or click on the button beside the URL to visit the page.That way, you can see the data and read the post yourself. And then work out how to write something even better.Of course, you might also be inspired to write other posts. Like a butterfly identification guide.2. Use Semrush’s Topic Research ToolWith the Topic Research tool, you can enter any blog topic to get a list of subtopics. This can help you generate more specific content ideas.Click on any subtopic to see the following: Top headlines from around the web Popular questions people type into Google Related searches people type into GoogleIn this example, you might be inspired to write about the best food for dogs with kidney disease.Read our guide to learn more about generating content ideas with Topic Research.3. Ask Your ReadersYou can get good blog topic ideas by asking your readers what they want.When writing your next post, ask them to leave a comment with their suggestions. Or request ideas via your newsletter and social media channels.hi what should we write about for next month's issue of @the247? https://t.co/NyGMfmxjyE #lightrickspartner— charli (@charlidamelio) March 23, 2022Engaging with your audience in this way is a great way to build loyalty. It makes readers feel that their opinion is valued.4. Discover Talking Points OnlineIn addition to asking readers directly, you can go to the places they hang out online. This gives you insight into the topics they’re talking about. Reddit is a good place to look. It’s a network of online communities (or forums).Just go to reddit.com and search for a relevant topic. You can then visit any interesting communities (their names start with “r/”).Stay in the “Hot” section to see posts that are popular right now. You can visit the “Top” section to see the most popular posts by time period.Some communities even have a wiki or other useful resources section.So, you should find plenty of blog topics to write about.5. Use Google TrendsGoogle Trends is a free tool that shows you trending search queries and topics for writing blogs. To get blog article ideas, go to Google Trends and search a topic. If you want, you can change the location and time period.The best place to find blog ideas is in the “Related topics” and “Related queries” sections.View both the “Rising” and “Top” results.In this example, one of the related queries is “eye makeup.” This would make a good topic idea for a makeup review blog.Read our Google Trends guide to find out more ways to use it for content creation.6. Find Commonly Searched QuestionsWhen people have questions, they often go to Google. And you can provide the answer they need in a blog post. This is a great way to increase your traffic.You can find commonly searched questions using Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. Start with a topical keyword then click the “Questions” filter.This method is particularly useful when you’re not sure how to pick a blog topic. Because it gives additional data that helps you prioritize your ideas.For example, keyword search volume (the average number of searches for the question each month). 7. Perform Keyword ResearchKeyword research is finding words and phrases that people enter into search engines. This tells you what type of content is in demand. And helps you create posts that rank higher in Google.You’ve already learned how to find questions. But many other kinds of searches could be relevant to your blog.To get good blog ideas, you need to focus on keywords with the right kind of search intent.For example, someone searching “buy mattress online” is looking to make a purchase, not read a blog post about different types of mattresses. (So Google doesn’t rank any blog posts highly.)But someone searching “best mattress for side sleepers” probably is looking to read a blog post. (Which is why Google ranks blog posts higher in the results.)Blog keywords usually have informational search intent. In other words, the searcher is seeking information. Perhaps an answer to a question.You can find these types of keywords with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. Just enter a seed keyword related to your topic. Then select “Informational” from the “Intent” dropdown.Alternatively, you can use keyword modifiers. Here are some words that people frequently use when searching for blog-style content: Blog post type Keyword modifiers How-to guide how, step by step, dos and don’ts Comparison post vs, compare, comparison, which, alternative, best Listicle top, ways, statistics, quotes, tips Checklist checklist, list Review review, pros and cons Definition introduction, 101, what, basics, guide Question who, what, where, when, why, how, is, can, should, could, will Gift guide gift guide, gift ideas, best gift Cheat sheet cheat sheet, crib sheet Template template, download, printable You can select common modifiers from the left-hand menu or add them to your search using the “Include keywords” filter.Once you’ve found promising keywords for your blogs, organize them into clusters.Keyword clusters are groups of keywords that share the same or similar search intent.You can target all the keywords belonging to a particular cluster on a single page.This way, you ensure you’re covering all the related keywords. And your page ranks for multiple, similar keyword variations.To form clusters, select your keywords and click “+ Add to keyword list.”Provide a name for your list and click the check mark. Once done, click to open the list.You’ll see all your keywords here.Now to group your keywords into clusters, go to the “Clusters” tab and click “Cluster list.”You’ll see your keywords grouped into clusters. Like this:When you click on any cluster, you’ll see all the keywords that are part of that group.Using all these keywords in your content can help you rank for the entire cluster and attract more traffic to your blog.Start Writing Your Next Blog PostOnce you have a blog idea in mind, head over to Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.
