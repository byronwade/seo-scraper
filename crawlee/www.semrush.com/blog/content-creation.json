What Is Content Creation?Content creation is the process of creating various forms of media that appeal to your target audience. It involves multiple steps, from generating an initial idea to promoting a published piece. And the content creation process involves different experts. For instance, content strategists often identify relevant topic ideas that align with marketing goals. And writers, video producers, and other creators turn these ideas into exciting pieces of content.Here are some of the most common roles based on our State of Content Marketing report:Why Is Creating Content Important?Content creation is key for ensuring you have what you need to reach potential customers. Why?Because it’s a key part of content marketing—a long-term strategy that involves developing and sharing content across channels to reach and engage your target audience. Which helps in your efforts to: Grow brand awareness Engage with different online communities Retain existing customers Educate potential customers Build credibility Improve organic (unpaid) search rankingsImproving organic rankings through content can be especially beneficial for reaching potential customers. You do this through search engine optimization (SEO), which involves creating and improving your website and content to rank higher in Google’s search results. Types of Content It’s a good idea to produce various types of content to maximize your reach. Here are just a few:Blog PostsBlog posts are a great way to educate readers (and they often account for a lot of website content creation). Blog posts also help with brand awareness, search rankings, and customer loyalty. In fact, the marketers and business owners surveyed in our State of Content Marketing report said both short-form and long-form articles were some of their best-performing content formats.Take a look at the results:Coming up with fresh blog ideas and executing them well is important. It helps your content to stand out from the crowd. Content Creation Ideas for Blog PostsHere are some blog post concept ideas to inspire you: 101 content: Answer frequent questions beginners in your industry have 201 content: Provide more sophisticated content for seasoned professionals Comparisons: Compare multiple solutions, products, or services Curations: Share the best resources on a given topic How-to guides: Give step-by-step walkthroughs for important processes News: Share announcements about recent company and product updates, awards, and moreYour blog can contain some or all of these content formats. For example, Semrush’s blog contains multiple categories with many types of blog posts. There are basic, 101-style pieces. But also advanced SEO articles, in-depth guides, and more. InfographicsInfographics are visual representations of data points or narratives. Infographics do a good job of conveying complex or data-heavy information in a digestible way. They also help break up walls of text. And tend to be shared on social media and referenced by other sites. You can look for interesting data relevant to your industry and visualize them with infographics. Or find inspiration from popular infographics in other industries. Content Creation Ideas for Infographics Infographics take many shapes and forms. Here are some ideas to spark your creativity: Process explanation: Break down a complex process related to your industry or product Industry trends: Use data to illustrate current trends in your industry Company timeline: Tell the story of your company and its key milestones FAQs: Convert your most frequently asked questions into an infographic Charts: Convey numerical data in bar charts, pie charts, and more Maps: Present location-based data and information with simple or custom maps Infographics can be impressive. For instance, look at this infographic that shows how Captura removes carbon from the environment. What if you don’t have the resources to produce complex infographics? Simpler infographics like the one below can also do the trick and get your point across. VideosVideos can be standalone pieces on YouTube or your website. But they can also enhance text content. And 45% of the marketers and business owners surveyed in our State of Content Marketing report cite video as the single most effective content format.Videos can be labeled with metadata, like tags and descriptions. But they can have limited searchability compared to text. And you can repurpose existing blog posts into video content. Founders and executives can also post short video clips on social media sharing their thoughts.Content Creation Ideas for Videos Whether you opt for live-action footage or computer-generated visuals, here are several video content ideas to look into: Explainers: Concisely explain a product, service, or concept Product demos: Walk through a product or service, covering its features and benefits Case studies: Feature satisfied customers who share their experiences Tutorials: Share step-by-step instructions on how to perform a task or learn a skill Behind-the-scenes: Show a glimpse into the inner workings of a business Animations: Tell a story in an animated formFor example, McKinsey & Company uses video in its article on nature conservation. The video (shown below) provides readers with additional details on the efforts their experts put into protecting ecosystems. PodcastsPodcasts create a deep connection with listeners through storytelling and discussions. They help build a loyal fan base. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population over age 12 has listened to a podcast, according to Edison Research. Starting a podcast doesn’t have to be daunting, either. Identify topics that both you and your audience are passionate about. Then, plan your content ahead. Decide whether you will invite guests or run solo, how long should episodes be, and more.After you record episodes, you can publish them on podcast directories like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts. You can also use listener feedback to improve.Content Creation Ideas for Podcasts Podcasts lend themselves well to many creative formats. Here are some ideas to explore: Expert interviews: Feature industry experts, thought leaders, and influencers Success stories: Explore how businesses related to your podcast’s theme achieved success Q&A sessions: Focus on answering questions submitted by your audience Industry trends: Highlight trending topics and emerging technologies in your niche Panel discussions: Engage experts in a panel discussion on a specific topic Reviews: Discuss books, movies, and events related to your podcast’s theme Try to release various types of podcast content to engage your audience. The popular business podcast “Acquired” is great at this.The hosts produce interviews, company origin stories, panel discussions, and more. Here’s a snapshot of what they’ve covered:Social Media PostsSocial media content enables brands to reach over 4.5 billion users. So they can connect with different audiences and cater to their preferences. And comments, likes, shares, and direct messages offer an opportunity to interact with audiences and foster a sense of community.One thing to keep in mind: Each platform has a specific type of content that performs well. For example, TikTok is known for its fun, short videos (shown below). And high-quality imagery is popular on Instagram.These platforms also collect user data. And brands can tap into this data to improve their content. You can also repurpose some of your blog content for social media.For instance, popular SEO-focused content can be turned into short explainer videos and shared across social media accounts. Content Creation Ideas for Social Media Posts Test different types of social media content to see what performs best. Here are some ideas to get you going: Content promotion: Share links to content published on your website Behind-the-scenes: Post photos or videos of your workspace or creative process Product spotlights: Explain the benefits of your latest product or service User-generated content: Reshare photos, videos, and reviews generated by your customers Polls and surveys: Gather opinions or insights from your audience Seasonal content: Comment on current festivities and holidays Inspirational quotes: Share motivational messages and quotes paired with exciting graphics Giveaways: Run social media contests to reward your followers Live videos: Conduct live Q&A sessions, event spotlights, and moreAnd social can be a good place to share a laugh.For example, Burger King doesn’t shy away from using humor in their social media posts. But you probably want to go beyond just posting humorous content. You also want to be approachable and share helpful content as well. Here’s how we do that: Interactive ContentInteractive content encourages users to engage with your content, which can translate to them spending more time on your site, following you on social media, and more. This can increase brand awareness and even help them move closer to making a purchase.Interactive content pieces also add instant value. Think calculators, polls, and interactive maps. And other sites are likely to link to useful pieces of interactive content. One way to ideate interactive content is to think about your audience’s needs. And how you can meet those needs in a way that static content can’t. Content Creation Ideas for Interactive Content Interactive content can take numerous forms. Here are some different formats: Quizzes & surveys: Enable visitors to learn more about themselves or their customers and employees through a series of questions Calculators: Help users find a numerical value for a specific process or purchase Interactive webinars: Give attendees the opportunity to comment and ask questions in real time Interactive maps: Allow users to focus on different geographical areas to uncover specific informationLooking for more specific examples of interactive content?Review these great examples: Madison Reed’s Hair Color Quiz Clearbit’s Total Addressable Market Calculator Empire Flippers’ Online Business Valuation CalculatorHow to Develop a Marketing Content Creation ProcessCreate great content by executing on an agreed-upon content strategy. Here are some key content creation steps you and your team can follow.Generate Content IdeasGreat content starts with developing ideas your audience will find interesting and useful. Those ideas should focus on your audience’s needs, interests, and pain points.How can you find that information? Here are several resources you can use to learn more about your audience: Analytics tools: Use Google Analytics, social media platforms, and other tools you have to learn about your audience’s interests and problems Sales reps’ input: Talk to your sales reps to discover the topics customers and prospects bring up most often Customer support calls: Listen to recorded calls from you support team to identify common themes across support calls that can be proactively addressed with content Online communities: Look for the topics your target audience talks about on forums, social media, Slack groups, and other online venues Competitive research: Examine your competitors to discover what kind of content they’re creating or find new angles on popular topicsAs you research, make note of overarching content ideas that align with your audience. These topics can inform seed keywords—broad search terms you can enter into a keyword tool to find more focused and relevant keywords.Let’s go over how to do that next.Research TopicsNow, it’s time to research topics based on your ideas and seed keywords. To find specific angles that you can create content around.You can do this using a keyword research tool like Keyword Magic Tool. Let’s say you want to find topics related to selling ebooks. Open the tool, type in your seed keyword, select the target country, and click “Search.” You’ll now see a list of keywords related to your topic, sorted by search volume. Like this:You’ll probably see thousands of results. So, how do you narrow your results? You can filter this keyword selection by including or excluding specific words. For example, maybe you don’t sell on Amazon. Just add “amazon” to the “Exclude keywords” field.You can also use the suggested groups and subgroups in the column to the left of the keyword list. This helps you sort keywords by subtopics. Here’s how it looks when you select “online” as a subgroup.Then, use the “Advanced filters” drop-down to find long-tail keywords. This option enables you to specify the word count, search engine results page (SERP) position, and other details of your ideal keywords. You can repeat this for multiple groups and subgroups. Then, you can group them into keyword clusters (groups of related terms) you can create different pieces of content around.You can also find ideas by using Keyword Gap to find out which keywords your competitors are focusing on. Navigate to the tool, enter your domain and the domains of up to four competitors, and click “Compare.” When you see the dashboard, scroll down and click on “Missing” in the “All keyword details for:” section.You’ll see the list of keywords your competitors’ sites rank for but your site doesn’t. There are probably a ton of options. So, how do you find good options? One way to do that is to filter by your competitors’ top pages. Go to “Position,” select “Competitors,” and click “Top 10.”Once you have a solid list of topics, you can use them to plan a content calendar that lays out when each piece of content will be published and on which channel.Then, write a brief for each upcoming topic. A brief outlines the specifics and expectations for a piece of content. It guides the process to ensure everyone understands the objective, audience, proper messaging, and other details.Tip: Semrush’s Keyword Strategy Builder offers an automated way to create topic clusters. Click the green “Create list” button, then add your seed keywords in the next menu, and press “Create list.” You’ll be provided with various clusters to work with.Produce Great ContentIt’s time to start the content creating itself. Maybe that means assigning it to a team member or freelancer. Or maybe you’re producing the work yourself.Either way, you want to focus on quality.Producing any form of great content involves making it: Audience-centric: Tailor content to your audience’s interests and pain points Valuable: Provide value to your audience by educating them or presenting solutions Clear and concise: Use plain language, avoid jargon, and keep the message straightforward Engaging: Use storytelling, visuals, and possibly interactive elements to capture your audience’s attention Credible: Cite credible sources, use data to back up claims, and consider interviewing experts Unique: Your content should offer something different than what's already out there Actionable: Good content encourages the audience to do something, whether it’s to think differently, apply the knowledge they've gained, share the content, or make a purchaseThere are other nuances to producing great content that you can explore in our content quality guide.One example of great content is this CB Insights piece about Discord: The article delivers value by sharing multiple examples, quotes, and data points. It’s written clearly and uses a lot of imagery to get the point across. And its structure is logical and easy to follow. It takes readers on a journey, starting with how Discord was launched and ending with what lies ahead. You also need to make sure an article is easy to understand and optimized for your target keywords.It’s easy to do this with the SEO Writing Assistant. Open the tool and click “Analyze my text.” Type or paste your content in the text field, add your target keywords, then click “Get recommendations.”You’ll now see suggestions for improving your content related to “Readability,” “Originality,” “Tone of voice,” and “SEO.”Here’s an example of what you might see:You don’t have to act on every recommendation. Assess to determine which ones are important to you, and then implement them. It’s also easy to share this content with team members to edit.
