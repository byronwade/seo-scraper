Share User-Generated ContentBuild community and engagement with user-generated content (UGC). Encourage your social media followers to create content around your brand so you can share it on your other channels and social media. Best of all? This effective marketing idea is free.The simplest way to generate UGC is by asking. Even your company’s biggest fans might not think to create a video or a tweet about your product. But if you ask them, they might be more than happy to help spread the word. Here’s an example from clothing retailer Boathouse:They have a branded hashtag to collect UGC, and encourage shoppers to “hashtag your look” on social media. They even incentivize it with a $50 gift card for the best content. Note: Always get permission before sharing UGC and credit the content creator.Social Media Marketing Ideas for Small BusinessesBuild a social media presence to increase brand awareness and engage potential customers. Create high-quality content to build a following and drive traffic to your website. Most social media platforms are free to use, making them cost-effective and powerful marketing tools. Use the following social media marketing ideas for small business owners to boost your engagement and create a professional presence.10. Create Business Social Media AccountsChoose the right social media platforms—Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, and X (formerly known as Twitter)—to reach your audience. Research which ones your target audiences uses and create a business account for each. A business account lets you share contact information, reviews, updates, and news. It also lets you create and manage your own social media community.Customize your profile with your logo, images, and video to raise brand awareness. Take advantage of cover and profile pictures to share news and promotions like we did with our 100,000th customer celebration on the Semrush Facebook page: Ensure your business profile information is up to date so customers will be able to reach you.11. Engage Your Audience Engage your audience to build trust and credibility in an authentic manner. How? Focus on having a conversation rather than constantly broadcasting self-promotional messages. Some free small business ideas for building engagement include the following: Respond to customer or audience questions Run polls to get insights or learn about your followers Host contests that encourage people to share or comment Create a quiz that helps your audience learn something Tag or highlight key customers (with their permission) Ask for feedback directlyBuild customer engagement by showing appreciation.For example, athletic accessory brand Outway had the perfect reply to a customer’s question: it was prompt, friendly, helpful, and concise:By replying to comments, it shows that person—and countless others—that the brand cares about its customers and that they actively want to engage with them. 12. Promote Your ContentOne of the best free marketing ideas for small business owners is to promote blog posts, videos, and other content on social media channels. Here are a few ways to promote content on social media: Tease content with article snippets or ephemeral story features (like Facebook and Instagram stories) to attract visitors to your website Include social media tags in your content pieces. Encourage visitors to share the content on their own social media networks. Consider how you can recycle or repurpose your content. Rather than simply linking to a blog post on your website, could you rewrite and format the content to work natively on LinkedIn or as a thread on X (Twitter)?13. Join Industry Discussions in Niche ForumsBuild connections and credibility by participating in niche forums and groups relevant to your business. Beyond the major social media platforms, there are specialized sites and communities around the web you can join. For example, the Social Media Today LinkedIn group is a great place for social media professionals and marketers to find resources and networking opportunities.No matter your industry or niche, you can find groups and forums to match—or start your own if you’d rather. This could include Facebook Groups, niche social platforms like Untappd, and sites like Reddit that discuss a wide variety of topics. Start discussions, provide useful insights, and discuss your business challenges. Check potential customers’ profiles to see what groups they take part in to find relevant sites to join.14. Increase Reach with HashtagsHashtags can help you reach a wider audience on social media.Incorporate relevant hashtags into your social media posts like #fallfashion, #fitness, and #homedecor. Be specific, and don’t make them overly long. Location-based hashtags are also a great addition to posts—think #newyorkrestaurantweek and #arizonaevents.You can also use hashtags to participate in global or national events. Just ensure it relates to your business. For example, bidet maker Tushy participated in #NationalToiletPaperDay to engage their audience, reach new followers, and indirectly promote their product: 15. Display Social Media Icons on Your WebsiteGet more followers and boost online credibility by displaying social media icons on your website. Put the icons in the header or footer to ensure they’re visible on every page. While you’re at it, use a social sharing plugin like Social Warfare or Revive Social to encourage readers to share your website and blog content online.Further Reading: 17 Best Social Media Tools to Use in 2024Email Marketing Ideas for Small BusinessesEmail marketing helps build connections with your audience and drive traffic to your website.Even better?

In your newsletter, include snippets of popular and relevant content, news about your company, and new promotions and offers. Include a call to action for each section of the newsletter like “Read More,” “Learn More,” and “Sign Up Now.” For example, Skillshare used multiple calls to action, including “Don’t Miss Your Free Trial,” in the following marketing email: Pro tip: Grow your email newsletter subscribers by offering a signup incentive like a one-time discount code, chance to win a free product or service, or exclusive content.17. Run A/B Tests Optimize your email marketing efforts by testing different email formats with an A/B test. Most email marketing platforms will offer this capability, making experimenting with different subject lines, images, content, layouts, and offers easy. You can also measure KPIs like open rates and conversions to see what resonates best with your audience.Use what you learned to tweak your emails and try again.
