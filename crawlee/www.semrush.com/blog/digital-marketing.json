  "content": "What Is Digital Marketing?Digital marketing, or online marketing, is the practice of promoting products and services using digital channels. In contrast to traditional marketing—think billboards and print media—digital marketing mostly happens online. Using internet-connected technologies and online marketing tactics.A digital marketing strategy is the backbone of many modern businesses.Why?Because it’s quick and cost-effective. And allows for granular targeting.The aim is to reach and engage potential customers to drive brand awareness and sales.Digital marketing includes a wide range of online marketing tactics. Like social media, search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, email marketing, and more. Why Is Digital Marketing Important for Business?The purpose of digital marketing is to reach your brand’s existing customers. And connect with potential prospects.Traditional marketing still has its place, but digital marketing has exploded since the onset of the digital age. Experts predict digital advertising and marketing will be worth $786.2 billion by 2026. What’s one of the fastest-growing, most in-demand job skills in 2024? Digital marketing. For businesses big and small, a solid digital marketing strategy could be the difference between success and failure.Benefits of Digital MarketingYour online audience can be massive. And you can reach them virtually anywhere, anytime. Unlike offline or traditional marketing, digital marketing offers you borderless access in real time.Audience Targeting at Specific Buying StagesDigital marketing allows for precise targeting of your audience at scale. Depending on where they are in the buyer journey. Contrast how you reach customers with traditional marketing. Advertising in local newspapers? Paying for billboards? Getting a slot on local radio stations? The above methods might reach a lot of people. But will everyone be interested in your services? Probably not.There are three stages of the modern customer journey.In the awareness stage, the consumer becomes aware of their problem and starts to research. At the consideration stage, they know their specific problem and start looking for solutions. Finally, the decision stage, where the consumer knows how to solve their problem. And looks for the best available solutions.Using digital marketing, you can create content for each stage of the buying journey.Engage blog visitors (awareness stage) with educational content and videos. Or retarget product viewers (consideration stage) with special offers across other sites they visit.Plus, through paid digital marketing channels, you can achieve even more precise targeting. Using paid search ads, you can show ads only to search engine users looking for your product or service. Paid social media advertising lets you target people with specific interests, job roles, income levels, and more.The goal? Get your message in front of the right people at the right time. Start by identifying your target audience. The group (or groups) of people most likely to be interested in and benefit from your products or services.Your target prospects share common characteristics, needs, and preferences that make them the prime recipients of your marketing messages. Next, build an ideal customer profile (ICP). An ICP describes your ideal buyer. Their profile explains who they are, what they like, what they need, and how they act.With clear information, you’ll better understand how your target market thinks, feels, and acts. To create your ICP, gather data through: Primary research through online surveys and focus groups Analysis of internal marketing and sales data to understand existing customers Social listening to identify trends and challenges prevalent among your audiencePolling tools like SurveyMonkey and Qualtrics can help your primary research. Semrush’s customer profile template helps you organize and visualize your data.Cost-Effective ScalingDigital marketing lets you target and grow your specific audience efficiently and cost-effectively. By putting you directly in front of potential customers interested in your offerings.For example, an online bakery could advertise to people in its area interested in baking, cake decorating, etc. You can target your message based on demographics, interests, behaviors, and more.Digital marketing allows you to start small and scale up your budget as you generate returns.Which means you don’t waste money reaching irrelevant audiences.Measurability and AdaptabilityDigital marketing offers detailed, real-time tracking of your campaigns’ performance. So you can adapt and optimize your digital strategy immediately. How? See exactly how many people viewed your online ad, clicked on it, and took action. Giving you instant feedback to improve your campaign.In contrast, traditional advertising methods like newspaper ads provide limited data. Although you know how many subscriptions or sales a newspaper has, you can’t tell how many readers have actually seen your ad. The lack of precise metrics makes it difficult to measure effectiveness and adjust strategies quickly.Real-time tracking and data-backed optimization is invaluable. Leverage a variety of tools to monitor and analyze your digital marketing data. Free platforms like Google Analytics and Google Search Console show you how users reach your website and interact with it.Say you run an ecommerce store selling outdoor gear. You launch a new paid social media ad campaign promoting your latest line of hiking backpacks.Here’s how Google Analytics’ real-time data tracking can help you:The tool gives you instant visibility into key metrics. Like website users, traffic sources, engagement levels, and geographic locations.You learn that ‌social ads are driving traffic from targeted locations, but your backpack product pages have low engagement times. And indicate poor landing page performance.Maybe the product descriptions or images don’t resonate with your audience. Next, you can make quick adjustments. Like tweaking the ad copy or updating the product content on your site. Then, monitor your analytics to see if those changes have had a positive impact on metrics like bounce rate, engagement rate, etc.9 Types of Digital Marketing (+ Examples)Broadly speaking, there are nine types of digital marketing. Let’s explore them. 1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)SEO-driven digital marketing increases your business’s visibility in search engines like Google. By optimizing your site and content to rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs).In general, the higher your rankings, the more organic (non-paid) traffic your website will receive. Because users tend to click on search results that appear at the top of the SERP.In fact, the first five organic SERP links receive 53% of all clicks.There are several techniques for optimization, including: On-page SEO: Making your web pages search engine-friendly and user-friendly. The process involves optimizing title tags, internal links, and URLs for search intent. Off-page SEO: A set of actions taken outside of your website to boost its authority score. Or how trustworthy and valuable search engines consider your site to be. Sites with higher authority tend to rank better in search results. One example is gaining high-quality backlinks (links from other websites to your site). Technical SEO: Your website should be well-organized, mobile-friendly, and fast-loading. To make it easier for search engines to understand, find, and store.Further reading: SEO Basics: How to Do SEO for BeginnersUse Semrush’s suite of SEO tools to optimize your digital marketing efforts.

Social Media MarketingSocial media marketing uses social media platforms to connect with your audiences, build your brand, and grow your business. Of the 5 billion-plus people who use social media worldwide today, 90% follow at least one brand on their social platforms. Your social media presence is like having a stall in the world’s largest open-air market. Where 90% of visitors are already customers of other stalls. The potential to build relationships and drive engagement is huge. Even if only a fraction of these visitors connect with you.For example, Duolingo’s social media presence combines quirky humor with current internet trends to draw attention to its language learning app. This memeworthy approach aligns with Duolingo’s mission of making language acquisition less tedious. Focusing on fun and accessibility.The leading social media marketing platforms are: Facebook Instagram WhatsApp LinkedIn Youtube X (formerly Twitter) TikTok​​These platforms provide excellent opportunities to engage and grow your audience.

Pay-Per-Click (PPC) AdvertisingPay-per-click (PPC) advertising is a technique where brands essentially pay for the chance to convert a user into a customer. Ads on search engines, like Google Ads, are the most common type of PPC advertising.To see PPC in action, perform a quick search on Google (or Bing) and check out the sponsored results at the top of the page. Like this:Other digital platforms where you could run PPC ads include: Social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and Instagram) Banners on websites Videos on YouTube Marketplaces (e.g., Amazon)A PPC ad may be a simple text ad, a display or banner ad, a product listing, or even a video ad.

Further reading: Find out how to set up an effective Google Ads campaign with our step-by-step guide and best practices.The first step to launching a successful PPC digital marketing campaign? Find the right keywords to target.Use Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to easily research keywords for your campaign.Start by entering a seed keyword. This is an initial term to help the tool identify a set of related, relevant keywords. In this example, our seed keyword is “water bottle.”TipEnter your domain in the “AI-powered feature” field to get personalized keyword suggestions based on your site’s content and current ranking. You can also do this at a later stage.Next, click on “Search.” Keyword ideas will appear in seconds.Toggle between “All Keywords” and these four keyword types: Broad Match: Keywords containing variations of your seed term with the words in any order Phrase Match: Keywords including your exact seed term with the words in any order Exact Match: Keywords showing your exact seed term in its specified word order Related: Keywords that show similar search engine results to your seed keywordTo get keyword suggestions specific to your website, type your domain name in the “AI-powered” search bar.“PKD%”, or Personal Keyword Difficulty, is unique to your site.

For instance, a PKD% of 60% and a KD% of 80% indicates a generally difficult keyword that your website could rank for. Choose keywords that balance PKD% and KD% for your next PPC campaign. Tick the boxes next to the terms you want to target. Hit the “+ Add to keyword list” button. Next, click “Create new empty list.”Name your keyword.The tool will collect all the keywords you’ve selected from the list.

Affiliate MarketingAffiliate marketing is a revenue-sharing digital marketing method. Here’s how affiliate programs work.Companies partner with affiliates—bloggers, YouTubers, and other influencers—to market their products and services via their regular content. Affiliates act as digital salespeople, promoting your brand to their followers. Every time they generate a lead or sale, they earn a cut.Like in this example from Cosmopolitan:This model is a win-win for both parties. Why?Because your brand gets increased exposure, traffic, and sales. And your affiliates get paid to push products or services they trust.The best part about affiliate marketing? You pay only when you get results. Meanwhile, you can tap into a wider market, track qualified leads better, and enjoy low-cost advertising. Here’s what makes it a cost-effective option: No upfront for creating ads or content Affiliates only receive a cut when they generate sales or leads Custom commission rate based on your goals and budget NoteSuccessful affiliates can earn significant commissions over time. Factor this into your long-term budget plans.Find potential affiliates is by joining an established affiliate network that connects brands with a pool of potential promoters.Some popular affiliate programs include: Amazon Associates Semrush Affiliate Program Elementor’s Affiliate ProgramThe affiliate links you create have built-in tracking.

Email MarketingA personal and measurable form of digital marketing, email marketing uses email to promote your product or service. According to a Zero Bounce survey, 88% of participants use email every day. Your target audience could be a click away. In fact, a dollar spent on email generates an average ROI of $36. Some examples of email marketing include: Newsletters Promotional offers Event invitations Product updates Content like blog posts or ebooksHere’s an example by cat food company Smalls: Image Source: Really Good EmailsEmail marketing include tracking open and click-through rates (CTR), segmenting your contact list, and sending targeted messages. NoteA segmented email list is a group of subscribers defined by a characteristic or behavior. For instance, you can segment by demographics, behaviors, or past purchases. For example, a skin care brand could segment its audience by skin concern—like acne, aging, or sensitivity. Then send targeted emails with product recommendations, skin care tips, and articles customized for each segment. The goal? Personalize messaging to increase customer engagement and loyalty.TipChoose a reputable email service provider (ESP) to manage your email marketing effectively. Popular options include Mailchimp or Constant Contact. 7. Influencer MarketingInfluencer marketing is a modern twist on affiliate marketing. You partner with social media stars who have loyal fans. Influencers can be celebrities or niche experts. But they all have one thing in common: their followers trust them.An activewear brand like Fabletics could partner with fitness influencers to reach your target audience. Like this:Sixty-nine percent of consumers reportedly trust influencer recommendations when making purchases—and even repeat purchases. Partnering with influencers lets you tap into their audience and leverage that trust. 8. Video MarketingVideo marketing uses video content to inform, engage, and convert your audience. This type of digital marketing relies on the power of sight, sound, and motion. Its purpose? To create an engaging, immersive experience. YouTube has over 2.5 billion monthly users hungry for video. Semrush’s YouTube channel is a real-world example of video marketing. Its subscriber numbers and views highlights the potential.What makes video content an effective digital marketing format?

A prominent call to action (CTA) to “Create a free account” is sized for easy tapping. Why mobile marketing? Two words: massive reach.Ninety-seven percent of U.S. adults own cell phones. Fifty-five percent say they’ve never gone longer than 24 hours without one.Mobile marketing includes a variety of tactics: SMS Push notifications (from websites and apps) Mobile-optimized website and email content Mobile apps Location-based marketingTo succeed, ensure you understand your target audience.

Now that we’ve covered digital marketing basics, let’s dive deeper. Distinguish between B2B and B2C digital marketing. And address online marketing challenges, automation, performance tracking, and budgeting.B2B vs. B2C Digital MarketingA B2B (business-to-business) digital marketer targets customers acting on behalf of businesses. For example, an industrial equipment maker would target construction firms.A B2C (business-to-customer) digital marketer focuses on individuals who purchase for themselves. For instance, a sustainable fashion brand that targets eco-conscious millennials.The category your business or ecommerce site falls into will shape your digital marketing strategy. Like this: B2B customers B2C customers Goal To make efficient purchasing decisions that will drive ROI To buy things that meet their immediate needs or desires Needs Functionality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness Convenience, personalization, and emotional appeal Buying process Typically long and complex, involving multiple stakeholders Generally shorter and simpler, driven primarily by individual research Drivers Educational content, case studies, and product demonstrations Reviews, social proof, and comprehensive product imagery Relationship More interpersonal communication with sellers, often resulting in long-term relationships Transactional communication, with short-term relationships In general, B2B customers needs more personalized nurturing.

Assess pages with unusually high exit rates to identify marketing issues or areas that need improvement Bounce rate: High bounce rates can indicate poor user experience or irrelevant content Conversion rate: Monitor how many visitors complete desired actions (e.g., sales, subscriptions, signups, downloads) to evaluate the effectiveness of your marketing efforts For instance, use Semrush’s Position Tracking tool to see how well your SEO efforts are working for your targeted keywords.
