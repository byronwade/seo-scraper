Wix Premium SiteWix offers both free and (four) paid plans. The free plan is adequate for a simple website with limited features. But lacks advanced functionality for comprehensive website analytics—like setting up a custom domain name for your site or adding third-party codes. A Wix Premium site enables functions like adding a custom domain, which enables Google Analytics 4 integration. As well as increased storage space.Any of the paid options let you connect custom domains and third-party codes. Which you will need to set up GA4.Google Analytics AccountIf you ‌already have a Google account and use proprietary products like Gmail, use your current account to sign in to Google Analytics. You can create a Google account if you don’t already have one. Step-by-Step GA4 Installation on WixWe’ll now go through the steps for how to add Google Analytics code to a Wix website. It only takes a few minutes. 1. Sign In to Google Analytics Sign in to Google Analytics with your Google account. You’ll see a Welcome page if it's your first time logging in. Click the \"Start measuring\" button.If you're a returning user, click the settings icon to access the “Admin” screen. Select \"Account\" from the top-left “+ Create” drop-down.A “Create an account” page will load. Give your account a name—preferably your business name. Next, choose your information-sharing preferences and click “Next” when you’re done.2. Create Your GA4 PropertyYou'll get a prompt to create your GA4 property. We suggest you name your property after your website's domain for easy identification. Select your reporting time zone and currency for accurate data reporting, regardless of your audience’s location. Click “Next.”3. Provide Your Business InformationInform Google Analytics about your business category so the tool can provide insights tailored to your industry.Select \"Other Business Activity\" if your industry doesn’t appear in the list.Next, indicate your business size.

Select a Business ObjectiveChoose from five business goal options: lead generation, online sales, brand awareness, user behavior analysis, and baseline reporting.Choose “Get baseline reports” if you’re unsure at this stage. You’ll be able to add more reports later. This option will display the “Life cycle” collection on your dashboard.Choosing a different objective will replace the “Life cycle” menu with a different data set. Here’s the lead generation option:NoteThe “Life cycle” collection will be the default data set in Google Analytics 4 under certain circumstances. Including if you don’t specify your business objectives during setup.Click \"Create\" to see a popup of GA’s terms of service. Review the terms, check the GDPR box, and click “I Accept.”5. Set Up Your Data StreamGetting your data stream up and running will allow your website data to flow into your GA property for analysis and reporting.Choose one of three platform types for your data. Web Android app iOS appIf you're tracking a website, select \"Web.\" You’ll get a pop-up that looks like this:Here, enter your website URL and provide a name for your data stream that reflects your website’s domain or purpose. It will help you to identify your data stream in your GA4 account easily. Enable the \"Enhanced measurement\" toggle. To allow Google Analytics to track various interactions on your website—like pageviews, scrolls, clicks, video plays, and downloads. Hit the “Create stream” button. Your Google Analytics account is now live. 6. Access Your GA4 Tracking IDClicking “Create stream” (see above) takes you directly to the Wix data stream associated with your GA4 account. Here, you’ll find your GA4 measurement ID—a unique identifier that links your Wix domain to your Analytics account. And lets GA track user interactions on your site.The ID is a series of letters and numbers that usually starts with \"G.\" Copy it for the next step.You're now ready to integrate your Wix website with Google Analytics. 7. Add the Measurement ID to Your Wix SiteTo add Google Analytics to Wix, you'll need to log in to your Wix website and head to the dashboard. Navigate to “Marketing” > \"Marketing Home.\" Look for \"Google Analytics\" and hit the \"Connect Google Analytics\" button.You'll get a prompt to add your Google Analytics ID. Paste in the measurement ID you retrieved from your GA4 account. Then, click the “Add Google Analytics ID” button.Enter the ID in the pop-up that appears and click \"Save.\"8. Test if GA4 Collects Data CorrectlyVerify that the data flows properly from your Wix site to GA4 using one of two methods.Check real-time reports in GA4: Navigate to your GA4 account’s “Admin” area and select the “Reports” screen.Click the “Realtime” report option, which captures live website data (i.e., page views, user activities, and other metrics).Here, you'll see a section called \"Realtime overview\" that monitors pageviews as they happen.If your tracking setup is working correctly, you should see the number of active users on your site, their locations, devices, and more. To test your Wix integration, open your website’s homepage (or any other page) in an Incognito window. If the data in your GA4 “Realtime overview” report matches your personal current activity, you're good to go.Use the debugger feature: Download the Google Analytics Debugger extension to monitor data sent to GA in real time.It’s particularly useful for troubleshooting issues with your tracking setup. And ensuring that the data GA4 collects is reliable for analysis. Click the extension icon to activate “DebugView” and wait for the “ON” alert.Now, head over to your Google Analytics account. Go to “Admin” > “Data Display” > “DebugView.”Since you haven’t performed any actions on your site yet, you’ll see an empty debugger interface indicating a “0” event count and “Waiting for debug events.”To confirm if GA4 is collecting data from your Wix website, go to the site and hit the refresh button.If the GA4 connection is successful, you will see events being sent to your GA4 property. The Debug Device interface will alert you to new events on your website.Troubleshooting Common IssuesWhat if you don't see any data in the real-time reports? Here are common reasons why your test might fail: Incorrect measurement ID installation: To solve this most likely issue, return to your Wix site. Ensure there are no spaces before or after the code, as this is a common error. Data processing delay: In most cases, the data should start flowing into GA4 right after the integration. Sometimes, it can take up to 24-48 hours. If you've just installed the tracking code, you might need to wait a while before you start seeing data.TipIf DebugView isn't working, check Google and Wix resources to help you troubleshoot frequently occurring issues. Or contact Wix for premium support if you’re a paid user.
