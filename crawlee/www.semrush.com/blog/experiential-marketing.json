  "content": "What Is Experiential Marketing?Experiential marketing invites consumers to interact directly with a brand to encourage brand awareness, action, and loyalty. Experiential marketing can include live events, conferences, pop-up stores, trade shows, etc. Or, online marketing tactics such as webinars and augmented reality (AR) campaigns. Experiential marketing is also referred to as engagement marketing, XM marketing, or participation marketing. How Experiential Marketing Strengthens Your BrandExperiential marketing works because it’s an immersive experience. In other words, you’re not talking at the customer—you’re involving them. Why is this important? Because experiences have a lasting impact. According to a study by The Wharton School, experiences provide more satisfaction and happiness than material goods. They also form a bigger part of a person’s identity: Experiential purchases might also create greater feelings of social connection because consumers are more likely to talk to others about their experiences than their possessions....telling stories about experiences is likely to feel more substantial and meaningful to both the speaker and listener, thereby fostering more of a bond between them.Simply put—you’re more likely to remember how a brand made you feel (your experience with them) over what you bought from them.

Spotify EverywhereImage source: Spotify—For The RecordTo educate users on its app features and brand partnerships, music streaming service Spotify created an in-person experience that engaged all five senses. Its Spotify Everywhere brand activation invited users to an “immersive house of audio where music and podcasts are everywhere you turn.” Every room in the New York City venue featured a product or tool by a Spotify partner that you could use to listen to audio. The house also included a kitchen with food from local bakeries and a fridge filled with Easter eggs. Within each egg was a scannable code to a Spotify playlist. Image source: Spotify—For The RecordThis appealed to the brand’s Gen Z audience, who Spotify says love discovering hidden Easter eggs and new music. Of course, all this is great for those in attendance. But what about those who couldn’t get to Manhattan? Spotify extended the experience to its online audience with a live virtual tour hosted on the brand’s Instagram account. It also decorated the venue in an Instagram-friendly palette. This inspired social mediainfluencers to share selfies with their followers. And increased the reach of the campaign. Spotify said the event was a success, resulting in buzz and shares across its social media channels.What You Can LearnTo show the full value of your product, think about how to bring it to life. Host events where people can come and try it out for themselves.Spotify Everywhere is a great example of how immersive marketing can educate customers in new ways. The company added sight, touch, taste, and smell to its listening experience. Customers saw how app features and partner products could enhance their experience by getting hands on. But your events don’t have to be as elaborate. For instance, you could hold live demonstrations in your retail location or at community events. When people can see and touch your products, they get first-hand experience with its benefits.And this can be a big selling point. Because understanding all the ways a product benefits you creates the perception of getting more for your money. 2. IKEA Place AppImage source: IKEA GlobalIKEA Place is an augmented reality (AR) app that lets customers test how products fit into their homes. Click on a product (sofa, lamp, rug, table, etc.), and the app uses your phone’s camera to “place” it in your space. All products are 3D and true to scale, so you can make sure they’re right for your room before buying. IKEA Place recreates the in-store customer experience for online shoppers. It makes IKEA products accessible to more people. And helps customers make informed decisions, reducing the number of returns. IKEA has traditionally relied on its print catalog to drive in-store sales. But interest in the brochure declined. At the same time, online sales were increasing. So, the company put more emphasis on ecommerce. And on using AR in their marketing.And they’re not alone. The AR Advertising market has been steadily growing in recent years. And projected to be worth $5.2 billion in 2024, and up to $7.5 billion in 2028.IKEA Place is the result of evolving to meet customer needs. It bridges the gap between catalog, store, and online shopping. And introduces the brand to more people. What You Can Learn Listen to your target audience.
