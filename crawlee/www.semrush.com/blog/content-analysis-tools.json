Some can do both. But the fundamental purpose is to help you improve content.The 10 Best Content Analysis ToolsIf you’re on a tight budget, start with the simpler free tools.If you want the best tools to maximize your content performance, skip down to the more comprehensive options.Simple (and Free) Content Analysis Tools1. Hemingway AppHemingway is a free tool for improving the clarity and readability of writing.You copy text into the editor, and it highlights various color-coded opportunities for improvement.It’s a fast way to identify things like: Sentences that are long or difficult to read Complex language that could be simpler Phrases that use the passive voiceIt’s one of the simplest content analyzer tools available. You can use it without even signing up.What We Like Simple to use, with quick and clear feedback A generous free-forever version AI rewrites and integrations are available by upgradingPricingHemingway's web app is free. However, you can buy the desktop application for Mac or PC for $19.99 (one-time fee). It gives you offline access and premium features like integrations with WordPress and Medium.You can also buy a Hemingway Editor Plus subscription for $10/month, which lets you use artificial intelligence (AI) to rewrite sentences. There’s also a 14-day, 200-sentence free trial available.2. ChatGPT ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool. It uses AI and machine learning to generate responses to user inputs.In the context of content analysis, ChatGPT is capable of handling functions similar to Hemingway. But with more flexibility.For example, you could take a passage of text and ask ChatGPT to review it. Here’s an example prompt and output.While other tools like Hemingway analyze a fixed set of criteria, ChatGPT is more versatile. Tailor your prompt according to what you’re trying to achieve. For example, you could also ask ChatGPT if you sound too formal. Or if there are any spelling mistakes (and so on).Then, ask the tool to rewrite sentences according to the feedback—if you agree it makes sense.It isn’t as straightforward to use as Hemingway, and there’s some degree of learning curve. Your results will only be as good as your prompts. But overall, it’s much more versatile and covers more use cases. For example, you could also get feedback from ChatGPT on how to improve your writing from an SEO perspective. And increase the chances of your content ranking in Google for target keywords.Here are some prompt ideas. You could ask ChatGPT to: Compare your content vs. a successful competitor’s to find gaps you haven’t yet covered Suggest frequently asked questions around your topic (and generate draft answers to them) Suggest internal linking opportunities to other related pagesHowever, if your goal is to optimize content for search, the process is simpler using a dedicated SEO tool like Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant (more on that below).What We Like Versatile tool that can assist with both optimizing for search and readability It can rewrite content as well as analyze contentPricingChatGPT is available for free. ChatGPT Plus is available for $20/month, which gives you access to GPT-4 and advanced features like browsing (which lets the AI tool browse the web).3. Google Search ConsoleGoogle Search Console (GSC) is a free tool to understand the organic performance of your website.It has other uses (such as technical SEO), but for the purpose of content analysis, some of the key use cases are to check: How much organic search traffic each webpage receives What users are typing into Google to find those pages Your organic positions (how highly your pages rank in the results)Checking which keywords your pages rank for (and the average positions) can be a great way to find content worth updating.To do that, go to Google Search Console and click “Search results” in the left sidebar (or “Full report”).Next, click “Average position” to show position data, then click on the “Position” column header to sort by positions.Look for queries where your position is 11-20. These pages make good targets for content updates. There’s a chance that updating the content to add more value to readers will nudge your page into the top 10 results, where you’re more likely to start generating clicks.What We Like It’s a great tool for understanding the organic performance of webpages It’s entirely free and simple to usePricingGoogle Search Console is available for free, with no paid version.4. GrammarlyGrammarly is another writing and editing tool with a generous free version.Like Hemingway, it can review readability. But it also checks spelling, punctuation, and more.Color-coded suggestions make it clear where to make improvements. Red shows suggested fixes for spelling, punctuation, and grammar Blue highlights show areas where to improve the clarity of your writing Green highlights mark suggestions to make your content more engagingGrammarly isn’t as simple as Hemingway because it has more features overall. It offers: One-click edits to fix the errors and redundancies it finds A more granular writing score out of 100 Character and word counts Reading or speaking timeGrammarly also lets you customize the suggestions it gives by asking your goals. For example, word choices might differ slightly depending on how formal you want to sound. Or how knowledgeable your audience is.There’s also a Chrome extension that allows you to get the core functionality of Grammarly anywhere on the internet. For example, in your email inbox.What We Like More customizable than simpler alternatives like Hemingway Extensive features in the free version Useful Chrome extensionPricingGrammarly has a free version available. Grammarly Premium starts at $30 per month for the individual plan and gives you access to features like AI text generation, plagiarism checks, and writing tone feedback.For teams, Grammarly Business plans are available starting at $15/seat/month (minimum three seats).5. RockeeRockee lets you take a different approach to content analysis using real user feedback.It is a content feedback platform that helps you understand what readers actually think about your content.Create a widget, embed it onto your site, and ask readers to rate your content. Then, collect a simple rating, data about who your reader is (e.g., job title), and collect comments.Once you’ve optimized your content for readability and SEO using other tools, adding user feedback will help you understand if it really resonates.Rockee also integrates with Google Analytics 4 (GA4). It allows you to combine quantitative data (like time on page or conversion rate) with your feedback and ratings for a more complete picture.What We Like It enables qualitative feedback directly from your readers It’s quick and simple to set upPricingThe free version of Rockee lets you customize a feedback widget and collect up to 15 responses per month. Paid plans start from £39/month (around $49/month).More Comprehensive (Paid) Content Analysis Tools6. SemrushSemrush is an all-in-one tool suite for online marketing.
