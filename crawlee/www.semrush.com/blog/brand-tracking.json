Brand Satisfaction Customer satisfaction surveys, post-purchase feedback, and service quality assessments provide insights into this area. Are you making customers happy? Brand Associations What qualities do consumers associate with your brand? Is your brand cool and edgy, or family-friendly? Conduct brand association studies to see what attributes, emotions, or values are linked to your brand. Brand Advocacy Gauge who is promoting your brand actively.
