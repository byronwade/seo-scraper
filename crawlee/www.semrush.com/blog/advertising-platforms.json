For example, If you're selling sports equipment, tailor your ads to fitness blogs or outdoor gear reviews, and use social channels your target audience prefers. Run small-scale tests with short, identical ads on platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook for a week. Track which platform drives more visits to your website or has higher engagement such as likes, shares, comments. Adjust your strategy to focus more resources (like ad spend and formats that fit the platform best) there Monitor the latest platform trends and demographic shifts to keep your digital marketing strategies relevant.
