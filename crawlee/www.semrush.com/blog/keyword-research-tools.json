  "content": "If you want to find valuable keywords, you need to use keyword research tools.In this post, we’ll look at 18 of the best SEO keyword research tools (including some free options) to help you perform effective keyword research.Let’s start.1. Keyword Magic ToolSemrush’s Keyword Magic Tool is a powerful keyword research tool. It draws from the largest keyword database on the market—over 25 billion keywords across 142 international databases. And has AI features to help you see data specific to your website.Enter your seed keyword (a broad term related to your business), enter your domain name in the “AI-powered feature” box, select your preferred country, and click “Search.” You’ll see thousands (or millions) of keyword ideas and their corresponding metrics in seconds. And if you entered your domain, you’ll also see your Personal Keyword Difficulty (PKD %) score—which indicates how difficult it would be for your specific domain to rank highly for a given term.This helps you quickly identify easier-to-rank-for keywords that are a perfect fit for your site. And have the potential to seriously increase your SEO rankings.Here's how to refine your results using this metric: Click the \"Personal KD %\" drop-down menu Select your desired keyword difficulty level (e.g., \"Easy\") or enter a custom range Click “Apply”Selecting \"Easy\" will give you a list of keywords that you’re likely to easily rank for by creating high-quality content that matches the searcher's intent.The table also displays \"KD %,\" the general keyword difficulty score. Which reflects how difficult it is for all sites to rank in the top 10 on Google for a specific keyword. Comparing “PKD %” and “KD %” can give you a clearer picture of what keywords are most relevant to your site.For example, the keyword \"cheap car insurance\" might have a high “KD %” of 85%, indicating strong competition. But if your website is known for its low-cost car insurance and has high website authority, this could lead to a lower Personal Keyword Difficulty score, meaning it’s more likely to rank in the top 10 than other sites with similar KD % scores. Consider using the following filters to further refine your results: “Questions”: To see keyword ideas in the form of questions “Broad Match,”“Phrase Match,” “Exact Match,” and “Related”: To see different variations of your seed keyword “Languages”: To look for keywords in different languages “Volume”: To search for keywords that fall under specific search volume ranges “Intent”: To see keywords that reflect a specific search intent, like “Informational,” “Navigational,” “Commercial,” or “Transactional”Pro tipRead our detailed keyword research guide to learn how to find the best keywords with the Keyword Magic Tool.PricingThe Keyword Magic Tool is a part of Semrush’s SEO toolkit.

And generates other related keyword ideas.Enter one or more (up to 100) keywords you want to analyze and input your domain name to get personalized results.Then, select your preferred country and click “Search.” The tool will generate an overview report for your keyword.The report has three main sections.The first section gives you a quick snapshot of key metrics, like: Volume: The average number of monthly searches in the selected database Domain-specific insights: Including Personal Keyword Difficulty, topical authority (your website’s overall authority and expertise on the subject), your ranking potential, and your current position in search results Intent: The purpose (or the “why?”) behind the searchHere’s what that section looks like:Click \"View high-potential keywords\" to see a list of keywords your website could easily rank for based on your current authority and the competition.The second section will give you an overview of other relevant keywords, including “Keyword Variations” and “Questions,” with PKD % scores next to each. Click the “View all # keywords” buttons to see all the keyword ideas related to your main keyword for each of the categories.Lastly, the “SERP Analysis” section shows the top-ranking pages for the analyzed keyword.Here’s what it looks like in the tool:Toggle the \"SERP Analysis\" heading to \"Domain\" to gain insights into your website's ranking potential for that specific keyword.Further reading: How to Use Keyword Overview to Analyze KeywordsPriceThe Keyword Overview tool comes with Semrush’s SEO toolkit.

Scroll down to the \"Pages Details\" section to better understand which keywords are most relevant to each pillar page and subpage.Clicking on any pillar or subpage reveals a list of keywords (called a keyword cluster) you can use on that specific page to optimize it for search.Look for the green \"high ranking potential\" tag. Which indicates an ideal combination of search volume and keyword difficulty.You can think of this way of organizing content like a tree: Trunk: Your pillar pages are like the main trunk of your tree. And cover broad topics (e.g., \"digital marketing\"). Branches: Your subpages are like the branches that stem from the trunk. They explore specific parts of your main topics (e.g., \"social media marketing\"). Leaves: The keywords listed under each pillar page and subpage are like the leaves on the branches.
