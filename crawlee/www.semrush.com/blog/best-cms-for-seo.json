In this article, we’ll review features to consider when choosing a CMS for SEO. We’ll also recommend the top nine CMS platforms to jumpstart your website’s SEO efforts.Features to Look for in a CMS for SEOWhen searching for SEO-friendly CMS platforms, focus on features that increase your site’s visibility and ranking.Each platform should include or integrate with tools that help you optimize your on-page and technical SEO. On-page SEO: Includes elements you can see, like keywords, headings, internal links, and meta tags Technical SEO: Includes metadata elements you can’t see. Think XML sitemap, robots.txt files, and canonical tags.Here are six top CMS features for SEO:1. Customizable Page ElementsOn-page SEO elements help search engines interpret and rank your content.So, look for a CMS platform that allows you to fine-tune these elements for greater online visibility.Tailor on-page SEO elements to incorporate online best practices.For instance: Page titles should match user intent and incorporate the correct target keywords. This can boost your content’s search engine visibilityHere’s how a page title looks on a search engine results page (SERP): Meta descriptions can act as a brief content summary to influence click-through rates (CTR) Image alt text will help search engines understand your images’ context2. Internal LinkingInternal links help search engines understand your website page hierarchy. And they improve the user experience (UX).An SEO-friendly CMS will have built-in features to help automate your link building.Linking from one page to another lets search engines find all the related content you offer on a given topic. Like this:Connecting all related content improves your chances of ranking for relevant keywords. Plus, internal links enable users to navigate helpful content easily. Good UX means visitors are more likely to stay on your site for longer.3. Analytics ToolsTracking and analyzing key SEO metrics helps you see how well your SEO strategy is working. Look for a platform with a dashboard that tracks these metrics regularly. You’ll be able to make decisions based on data. And identify areas for improvement.Understand whether your SEO efforts pay off by looking at metrics around: How your website performs in search engines How users interact with your content How your SEO efforts translate into traffic and conversionsFor example, analytics tools like the GA Google Analytics plugin provide real-time tracking and metrics reporting. This GA4 plugin from WordPress allows you to track user engagement, traffic sources, conversion rates, and more for your website’s content.4. Mobile-Friendly/Responsive Design OptionsA mobile-friendly website adapts some features of your website to mobile devices.A mobile-optimized website does as much as possible to make your site mobile-friendly.A responsive website can adapt to any screen size.Choose a CMS with mobile-optimized or responsive themes and templates. This retains your website’s layout and functionality across mobile devices. It’s also an SEO ranking factor. Google says this about mobile-first indexing:While it’s not required to have a mobile version of your pages to have your content included in Google’s Search results, it is very strongly recommended. These best practices apply to mobile sites in general, and by definition to mobile-first indexing.Google prioritizes mobile versions first when crawling your site. And since most internet users access content through mobile devices, you want to ensure your site is equipped to help you capture mobile organic traffic.5. SEO PluginsPlugins are extensions that add functionality to your CMS. They give you more control over your site’s features without having to tweak the code.Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant plugin for WordPress helps you create easy-to-read content that’s optimized for search engines and UX.It uses AI to ensure that website visitors find your content readable with a consistent tone of voice.It also checks your content for plagiarism. Then suggests areas you can rephrase to improve your content’s quality and originality.6. Easy Redirection ToolsRedirections improve UX by rerouting outdated or redundant links to existing pages on your site. Make sure you look for a CMS with easy ways to redirect one page to another. Why? So users (and search engine crawlers) don’t land on broken or duplicate content. Crawlers can’t crawl broken URLs. You risk losing your keyword rankings if there’s no redirection.And users who land on an outdated or broken page will likely bounce to another site.A CMS that uses a plugin like Yoast SEO’s Redirect Manager lets you set up a redirect.
