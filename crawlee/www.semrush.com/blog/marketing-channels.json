You can run ads on social media platforms, but that’s considered digital advertising. Which we’ll cover later. On social media, you can post content, respond to your followers, and even manage customer service issues. Plus, it’s free to post content.One popular brand that uses social media effectively is Nike. They regularly post high-quality photos and videos on Instagram showcasing their products, athletes, and inspirational quotes and stories.It's important to choose the right platforms.
