  "content": "Google Business Profile, otherwise known as GBP (and formerly known as Google My Business), is a valuable marketing tool that’s often underused.But taking advantage of this free listing can help you boost brand awareness on the world’s most popular search engine and gain more customers.Here’s how to make the most of your GBP:1. Write an Engaging, Keyword-Friendly Business DescriptionBesides your business name, your GBP description is the first thing users see when your business pops up on Google search.So, you need it to be accurate, compelling, and relevant to your target audience.Here’s how to do it:Be Concise and Showcase What Makes Your Brand UniqueProvide clear information about what you do. But sprinkle in some personality by highlighting your brand’s story, mission, and core values. Let’s look at this example from fashion boutique Aritzia: From the GBP description, we immediately learn Aritzia’s target audience: women. We learn what they offer: clothes. We learn that their core goal is to provide high-quality, contemporary fashion at a valuable price. And we get this key info in the first three sentences. Then, they highlight their true “secret sauce”: developing their own brands, searching for top sources across the globe, and paying close attention to details.It’s short, engaging, and informative. Follow Aritzia’s lead with your own quick blurb that focuses on what you do and what makes your brand stand out.NoteGBP descriptions have a 750-character limit. To write your “Description,” log into your GBP account. Click on “Edit profile.” A box will open with all your “Business information” options. Click the pencil icon next to “Description.”Then, enter your text into the Description box.Not sure where to begin? Our AI Writing Assistant can help.Include Strategic KeywordsBesides writing a description that potential customers respond well to, you also need search engines to respond well to it.This is where SEO keywords come in. Including relevant, frequently searched terms connected to your business and industry can help you rank higher on search engines. Which makes it easier for customers to find you. Say you’re a local pet store. It would make sense to include location-specific keywords in your profile to target pet owners in your area.But you don’t want to just throw in phrases like “pet stores Wisconsin” over and over again. This kind of keyword stuffing is obvious to readers and search engines and takes away value from your profile. Keywords should naturally fit into your writing.Like this:To find the right phrases to boost your profile visibility, start with keyword research. This just means finding and evaluating strategic keywords for your specific company to target.It might seem intimidating if you’ve never done it before, but don’t worry. Our Keyword Magic Tool can help you find the right phrases to include to boost your profile visibility.To start, you need a broad phrase or term related to your brand’s niche or industry. This is known as a seed keyword. Seed keywords serve as the starting point from which you’ll find more specific keywords.For example, “pet stores.”NoteSeed keywords aren’t the same as primary keywords. Seed keywords are much more generic, as they serve as the root point of your search. Primary keywords come from seed keywords. They’re the main ones you actually use in your SEO strategy.Type in your seed keyword word and click the “Search” button.Then, click through the following tabs: Broad Match Exact Match Related The “Broad Match” tab will show you variations of your seed keyword. The “Exact Match” tab shows phrases that include your exact seed keyword.And the “Related Match” tab shows you search terms that are similar to your seed keyword.As you come across potential keywords to add to your profile description, save them using the checkbox to the right of any keyword result. Then, hit the “+ Add to keyword list” button. You can add to an existing list or click the “Create new empty list” text box to create a new one. Click the checkmark to the right to save your selections.Further reading: How to Do Keyword Research for SEO (A Detailed 3-Step Guide)2. Set Up Direct MessagingSet up direct messaging to answer questions, get feedback, and engage with potential customers. Image Source: MARAThis GBP feature allows searchers to contact you directly. So, you can quickly provide information and respond to questions that can boost sales and encourage more business.Responding to each customer’s concern personally shows that you value them. This helps build trust and satisfaction. And happy customers are likely to recommend your business to others.To set it up, open the “Messages” section on your GBP dashboard.NoteIf you haven’t done so yet, Google will ask you to verify your business before you can set up direct messaging. Click the blue “Get verified” button. Enter your business address and click “Next.” If accepted, you’ll see “You're now verified.” Click “Next.” You may also need to confirm your business hours. Once that’s done, click “Next.” Then, you’ll see “Add messaging.”Click the “Turn on” button and add your contact info so customers can use it to reach out to you.Then, you’ll receive a verification code from Google to confirm your identity. Enter that code, and you’re all set.How to Automate Basic RepliesEven if you can’t get to a customer inquiry right away, people want to know their message has been received. According to a 2022 survey, 70% of American consumers expect a same-day response after contacting a company. Automated replies give customers a reasonable expectation of when they can expect to hear from you so they don’t think you’re ignoring them.GBP has an automated, customizable “away message” feature you can use to initially reply to users.Go to “Messages” > “Chat settings” > “Away mode” to set yours up.Make sure to keep your away messages up-to-date—especially if you add any details like: Away for the holidays On vacation until … We’re moving to a new location!Further Reading: What is Omnichannel?

Add Compelling Photos That Represent Your BrandWhether you’re adding to your GBP photo album or uploading a post or product, you want high-quality pictures that show off the best of your brand.Image Source: Sassy Cow CreameryThese visuals are key to hooking in new customers and driving engagement.Here are some best practices: Ensure your pictures adhere to Google’s photo guidelines: Following Google’s standards for file sizes and formatting makes sure they’re clear and upload correctly Post different types of photos: From exterior shots to staff and customer interactions, strive to show a 360-view of your business Add new photos to share updates: Keep things fresh and keep shoppers in the loop on your latest products, specials, and events Showcase your business’ unique features: Share pictures of the things your customers will want to take pictures of, whether it’s a unique dish or a vivid muralPro tipBesides your own pictures, share relevant user-generated content (UGC) from customers using your products or services. These photos tell an authentic story about your company and encourage others to take their own pictures in the hopes of getting featured on your page.To upload a picture, go to your GBP dashboard and click the “Add photo” icon. Choose “Photo.”Click “Select photos or videos” or drag your files into the box.You can click “See photos” to view your photo right away or hit “Add more photos.”After you click “See photos,” a new screen will appear that says one of three things: Pending: The photo is processing and not yet public on Google Not approved: The photo was flagged for not meeting Google guidelines (e.g., size is too small or too large, unaccepted file format, you haven’t verified your business profile, etc.) Live: The photo is posted on your profile If your photo is flagged, click “Learn more” and you’ll be redirected to the photo guidelines.Further reading: Visual Search Guide: What It Is, Benefits, and Optimization Tips3. Regularly Post to Your Google Business ProfileThink of your GBP as an extension of your existing social media marketing strategy. Taking the time to regularly update your GBP helps you enhance brand visibility and customer engagement.Posting frequently shows that your business is active and gives searchers an idea of what your brand is all about. And you can use your posts to encourage users to move down the marketing funnel.GBP offer three different kinds of posts: Update: Use this for regular posts. Offer: Use this for specials and promos. Event: Use this to promote any kind of special event. How to Create and Publish a Google PostSign into your GBP account. Click the “Add update” button on your dashboard. You might have to click on the drop-down arrow if you don’t initially see it as an option.Choose “Add update,” “Add offer,” or “Add event.” For this example, we’ll use “Add update.” Now, type in your update. Then, add up to 10 photos.Next, you’ll see options for a call to action (CTA). While this isn’t a mandatory field, we highly recommend using it. This clickable button makes it easy for users to take a certain action, like buying a product, signing up for a newsletter, or visiting a webpage.Just pop in your desired URL and choose one of the pre-set CTA titles: Book Order online Learn more Sign up Call nowBefore making your post public, click on “Preview” to double check that everything is how you want it. Use the back arrow in the top left corner if you need to make any edits. Once you’re satisfied, click the “Post” button at the bottom right corner of the page. Once published, the post will appear at the bottom of your live profile. 4. Make the Most of Product and Service UploadsAccording to Mintel, around half of surveyed consumers in the United States have bought products through social media platforms. And adding your products and services to your GBP profile is no different than doing so on a platform like Instagram or Pinterest.This makes it even easier for searchers to browse and buy from you. And searchers can quickly find what they’re looking for using sidebar filters.Pro tipUse the “Collections” button to organize all your products in easy-to-navigate categories. Google recommends that you aim for at least three products in each collection.To add a product to your profile, sign into your GBP account and click on the “Edit products” icon. A new window will appear. Click the “Get started” button. Now, it’s time to optimize your product upload.Create Detailed DescriptionsLike your business description, your product descriptions can make or break customer interest. So, you need your them to be concise, thoughtful, and keyword friendly.Start by adding the product name, price, and webpage URL in the relevant fields. Then, highlight the core features of your product or service that’ll resonate with your target audience.Let’s say we were selling candles. Some notable elements to hone in on could include: The basics: A rose-gold, vanilla-scented candle with a four-hour burn time, perfect for intimate dinners or a relaxing bath Product components: Blend of natural soy wax and high-grade vanilla essence for a clean, authentic fragrance Stand-out features: Made locally by company founder, Julia, and her sister, Maria, ensuring each candle has a personal touch Packaged in eco-friendly materials to reduce environmental footprint Don’t forget to integrate relevant keywords into these descriptions (e.g., “vanilla candle,” “eco-friendly candle”).
