By harnessing machine learning and models, AI allows computers to analyze data, make informed decisions, and execute tasks that traditionally require human intelligence. So where does that leave you, the human marketer?Our Think Big with AI report revealed that 67% of businesses already leveraged AI for content marketing and SEO in 2023. AI isn’t just a trend. It’s a tool for staying competitive and delivering precisely what your customers seek.In this article, we'll discuss several ways that you can leverage AI in your advertising campaigns–in your strategy, toolkit, and execution–to get more done in less time.AI in Advertising: How is it Being Leveraged? Artificial intelligence can be defined simply as a machine's ability to read and understand patterns and make predictions about what will happen next. Every day, AI works behind the scenes in advertising, helping decide which ads to show you based on what you like and do online. For publishers, it makes their platforms more intelligent and effective. According to the Marketing Artificial Intelligence Institute, both Google Ads and Meta Ads “use AI to sell, target, and place ads micro-second by micro-second.” For advertisers, it can help make campaign creation more efficient. With generative AI, advertisers can create copy and design in seconds instead of hours. This has clear benefits for publishers and advertisers, and AI is already ingrained in our daily lives. AI can transform digital advertising by dynamically monitoring performance, adjusting budgets and bids in real-time, and automatically turning off underperforming ads to optimize campaign efficiency.Elena Guseva, Paid Traffic Channel Manager, SemrushConsider the following examples of AI in everyday life: Personalized shopping recommendations on ecommerce sites Voice-activated assistants like Siri and Alex, Social media feeds curated based on your interests Navigation apps based on real-time traffic data Personalized recommendations on streaming TVWith artificial intelligence, you can recommend more appropriate content to your audience.But it's not just about personalization. AI also makes advertising more efficient. Machines can handle repetitive tasks, like generating a large number of different ad designs, much faster than a human could. This saves time and money, allowing businesses to focus on other things.However, it's not all smooth sailing. When using AI, there are issues to consider, such as data privacy, ethical concerns, and the risk of over-reliance on technology. It's important to navigate these challenges carefully, ensuring that AI is used responsibly and effectively to enhance the advertising experience for both businesses and consumers.The Impact of AI on Advertising: Will It Work for You?Are you using AI in your marketing efforts?Although most companies have embraced AI, not everyone is ready to incorporate it. Many challenges were mentioned among the 33% of participants in the Think Big with AI survey who don’t utilize AI in their content marketing. These included comprehension of the technology and worries regarding plagiarism, quality, and legal implications.Like any tool, AI in advertising has its ups and downs, and ultimately, it's all about how you use it. Let's break down the pros and cons of AI in advertising:Pros: Personalization: AI can tailor ads to individual preferences at scale, leading to more effective campaigns that resonate with the target audience on a personal level. Automation: AI can automate many manual campaign processes, such as designing ads, writing copy, targeting audiences, and managing campaign budgets and analytics, freeing up time for other tasks. Dynamic Optimization: Google’s AI tools can optimize ad campaigns in real-time, adjusting variables like bidding, targeting, and creative elements to maximize ROI. Time-Saving Content Creation: Generative AI streamlines the creative process, enabling copywriters and designers to produce content more quickly and efficiently​​​​.Cons: Data Privacy: The extensive data collection required for AI-driven advertising raises concerns about consumer privacy and the potential misuse of personal information. The Human Factor: Often, generative AI misses the mark on the emotional connection that only humans can bring. In addition, people don’t often enjoy conversing with a machine (i.e., chatbots) Algorithm Bias: AI algorithms can perpetuate biases in the training data, leading to unfair targeting or exclusion of certain groups. Overreliance Risk: Leaning too heavily on AI can lead to a lack of human oversight and creativity, damaging your reputation instead of enhancing itUltimately, AI excels in efficiency but may struggle to capture human emotion. The key is combining AI's strengths with human insight. This approach should begin with a well-thought-out game plan that leverages the best of both worlds.Crafting Your AI Advertising Game PlanIncorporating AI into your marketing strategy doesn’t have to be complicated. It’s all about making your life easier. Start by constructing a strategic game plan for incorporating AI into your advertising campaigns. This plan should outline your objectives, the AI tools you'll use, and how you'll measure success. Let's explore a sample strategy to kickstart your AI journey. Step 1: Assess Your Current Advertising Landscape Any good strategy starts with an audit. Begin by thoroughly reviewing your existing advertising strategies, channels, and outcomes. This includes: Analyzing your target audience demographics, their online behavior, and engagement patterns Examining your ad spend efficiency across different platforms and identifying which campaigns have yielded the best ROI Considering your brand's market positioning and how your current advertising aligns with your overall marketing objectivesThis initial assessment will provide a clear picture of where your advertising stands and where there's room for improvement with AI integration.For example, let's say you're advertising a local coffee shop. You examine your current social media ads to gauge reach and engagement. You hypothesize that while the ads hold potential, they might need better personalization and targeting.Personalization is key in digital advertising. AI can support this by testing different ad copies, languages, and images to find the most effective combination for engaging the target audience.Elena Guseva, Paid Traffic Channel Manager, SemrushStep 2: Define Clear Objectives Set specific and measurable goals for your AI advertising efforts. These objectives could include things like: Reduce the average time to launch campaigns by 20% within the next quarter Increase the number of audience segments used for personalized ad testing by 30% within six months Improve the return on ad spend for key assets by 15% over the next yearDefining your objectives early in your campaign strategy ensures your goals align with your broader business objectives and are achievable with the AI tools you decide to use.For example, using AI-powered ads, your coffee shop can aim to increase foot traffic for a new seasonal latte. You aim to boost in-store visits by 25% over the next month by targeting local coffee enthusiasts with personalized ads ​​​​on social media platforms that feature the drink.Step 3: Understand AI Capabilities and Limitations Artificial intelligence offers immense potential in advertising, but it's essential to remember its capabilities and limitations. Where AI excels: Rapid Ad Creative Generation: AI can quickly produce a variety of ad creatives, streamlining the design process. Data-Driven Targeting: By analyzing customer data, AI can help create detailed audience segments for more personalized ad campaigns. Efficient Campaign Management: AI automates repetitive tasks like ad placement and optimization.AI limitations: Creativity: AI may struggle with the subtleties of human emotion and creativity, which are crucial for compelling ad content. Context Understanding: AI can sometimes miss the context, leading to inappropriate or ineffective ad placements. Data Dependency: AI's effectiveness depends on the quality of the data it uses or on user input.In addition, when using AI tools, pay attention to privacy and security concerns and ensure your AI applications respect confidentiality.For your coffee shop's campaign, you might use AI to automate the targeting of your ads, ensuring they reach local coffee enthusiasts on social media. However, before running the campaign, you'll still need to oversee the creative aspects of your ads to ensure they capture the unique essence of your seasonal latte and resonate with your audience.Step 4: Select the Right AI Tools After researching, it's time to pick the right tools for your advertising needs. Look for tools that match your advertising goals and integrate seamlessly with your marketing setup. Here are some features to consider: Dynamic design creation to keep things fresh Automatic copywriting tailored to your message and your audience Predictive analytics to foresee how your campaign will rollMake sure the tool is user-friendly, scalable to accommodate your business growth, and backed by reliable support. Remember to check its privacy and security features to protect your brand and customer data.For the coffee shop, you might choose an AI platform that excels in creating dynamic ads and segmenting audiences, enhancing your social media advertising efforts.AI can be a game-changer in ecommerce by automatically pausing ads for out-of-stock products and turning them back on once they are restocked, ensuring advertising efforts are always aligned with inventory availability.Elena Guseva, Paid Traffic Channel Manager, SemrushStep 5: Run Your Ad CampaignNow that you've set up your strategy and selected your AI tools, it's time to launch your ad campaign.How can AI help here? Launching with Confidence: Start your campaign based on the insights and targeting strategies you've developed with your AI tools. Monitoring Performance: Keep an eye on key metrics like click-through rates and conversions to gauge the success of your campaign. You can manually monitor performance or choose an AI-powered tool that automates the process (for example, Google Ads has this feature built-in). Adjust as Needed: Use the data you gather to make real-time adjustments to your ads, ensuring they resonate with your audience and achieve your objectives.Let’s say your coffee shop launches a series of social media ads targeting coffee lovers in their area. As the campaign progresses, they notice that ads featuring their new seasonal latte are getting more engagement. From here, you can allocate more budget to those ads or even use AI generation to make more ads related to the seasonal latte quickly. Step 6: Scale AI IntegrationIf all is going well, consider expanding the use of AI in your marketing strategy. Pick AI tools that fit your bigger marketing goals and ensure your team knows how to use them. Keep an eye on how these AI-powered efforts are doing and tweak as needed.
