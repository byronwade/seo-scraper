  "content": "What is Twitter SEO?\"Twitter SEO\" refers to strategic actions to increase the visibility of your tweets on Twitter and search engines such as Google. Note: Twitter is now officially called X.These actions include optimizing tweet content, user profile info, and engagement tactics to increase discoverability and exposure to new and relevant audiences.We’ll address two strategies for Twitter SEO: Twitter SEO for Twitter search: How to increase visibility of tweets in Twitter’s own search feature Twitter SEO for Google search: How to increase the visibility of your tweets in Google search engine results pages (SERPs) 1. Twitter SEO for Twitter SearchWhen you enter a query in Twitter’s search bar, an internal process prioritizes what tweets you see first. Click the “Explore” tab on the left sidebar of Twitter (or click on a trending topic from the right sidebar of the home screen). Using the search bar at the top of the screen, enter a search query and hit “Return” on your keyboard to see the results. From there, you’re able to filter the search results by: Top (default) Latest People Photos VideosTop Tweets results (tweets that X believes you are most likely to care about) are organized and ranked by an algorithm. According to its help documentation: We determine relevance based on the popularity of a tweet (e.g., when a lot of people are interacting with or sharing via retweets and replies), the keywords it contains, and many other factors.2. Twitter SEO for Google SearchWhen you conduct a search on Google, you may see a Twitter-specific SERP Feature. It appears as a tweet, a Twitter carousel, or a Twitter account.If you click on any of these results from Google, you’re taken to the associated Twitter account—whether the individual tweet or the profile of an account. So why would anyone care about their tweet or account’s position in search? The Benefits of Twitter SEOJust like standard SEO, there are numerous benefits to SEO on Twitter. More ImpressionsIf your tweets rise to the top of searches, more people will see them. Impressions are necessary to produce high-value, engagement-oriented actions such as likes, retweets, and clicks. Therefore, your first step toward earning those coveted user actions is to earn impressions. More EngagementIf more people are seeing your tweets, there’s a better chance that they will also receive more engagement by virtue of larger exposure. Note that impressions and engagements don’t necessarily scale in equal proportion. Tweet engagement includes these actions taken by users: Like Reply Retweet Quote Tweet Bookmark Share URL click Hashtag click Media viewsIn SEO, and digital marketing in general, engagement is considered a universally positive indicator. Since tweets can also contain links to more valuable owned assets (like blog posts and landing pages) on a website, engagement on Twitter can also lead to additional standard engagement metrics like pageviews and conversions. More Twitter FollowersThe more people who see your tweet, the higher your chances of converting those impressions into new followers. Again, don’t expect increases in impressions, engagement, and followers to scale proportionately. More TrafficPublic Twitter profiles and tweets are indexable by Google, which means effective Twitter SEO can feed into and enhance your larger SEO and marketing strategy. This can increase traffic, improve your digital footprint, and raise brand awareness.Ranking Factors for Twitter SEOTwitter uses an algorithm to choose what tweets to display in your feed and in what order. It switched from a purely chronological system in 2016.While the algorithm is not public, there are several published ranking factors analyzed by third-party sources that send specific tweets to the front of your feed. Note: The following ranking factors are listed in no particular order. RecencyThe date and time when a tweet was published impacts its ranking. In the feed, the majority of tweets shown are within a few hours of posting. Use the “Explore” tab with keyword searches to find older tweets. RelevancyTwitter's algorithm prioritizes tweets that are deemed most relevant to you. Relevancy is determined by how well it matches your interests, behaviors, and previous interactions. EngagementThe amount of engagement a tweet receives influences its position in your feed. This includes likes and retweets, plus any of the engagement actions listed under More Engagement. High engagement levels tell Twitter that an account’s content is interesting and valuable. HashtagsHashtags are used to categorize your tweets and make them discoverable to users interested in specific topics. Use trending and relevant hashtags to boost your tweet's visibility. Pro tip: Limit yourself to one or two hashtags per tweet to ensure readability. Account reputationThe perceived credibility of the account that posted the tweet affects how it ranks in the feed. Factors such as the age of the account, the consistency of posting, and the average amount of engagement received indicate that an account has achieved a favorable reputation. Previous account interactionsIf you have a history of engaging with a specific account, tweets from that account will be scored higher in the ranking system and be shown more prominently in your feed. MultimediaSimilar to other social media platforms, tweets with images and video seem to achieve more prominence in your feed. There is speculation that tweets with links to websites configured with Twitter Cards might receive even more favorable positioning. LanguageTweets in your native language or a language you speak can affect their position in your feed. While these are determining factors for Twitter, remember that Google indexes and displays tweets in SERPs. That said, it’s important to add a few ranking factors more commonly associated with standard SEO. Google SEO Factors to Keep in MindIf you’re trying to rank your tweets in Google SERPs, here’s a refresher on some SEO basics that also apply to tweets. Search intent: The Google algorithm prioritizes search results that most accurately match the user's search intent. If your tweets and profile information match the intent of typical searches in your industry or field, it can improve their SEO ranking. Quality: Google analyzes content quality on Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). Content that demonstrates E-E-A-T is more likely to rank favorably in Google SERPs. Usability: Google tends to favor content that provides a user-friendly experience. It’s important that any links you share on Twitter lead to mobile-friendly, fast-loading, and easily navigable web pages. Now let’s take a look at five tactics you can implement to boost your Twitter SEO. 7 Tactics to Improve Twitter SEO1.
