The better the prompt, the better the response.Here’s how to create prompts for ChatGPT that help get you the most useful answers: 1. Provide Contextual DetailsContext helps ChatGPT understand your specific situation and requirements better. So it can narrow down the information and give you more tailored responses. For example, with a general prompt like, “write a sales pitch,” you get the following:The result is a generic pitch that isn’t tailored to your brand, tone of voice, product, or target audience. Let’s add some context by specifying the product and audience.Now, the messaging is more likely to connect with your audience and encourage them to take action—in this case, to buy your product.Similarly, saying, “discuss popular social media platforms” returns random, general information about every social media platform:With more direction, ChatGPT can focus on exactly what you need and want. Like comparing the features and target audiences of specific social media platforms.2. Feed It Content or Reference MaterialRight now, ChatGPT can’t fully browse the internet, although it can search using Microsoft’s Bing web browser.So if you want to get the most accurate and up-to-date responses, you need to provide additional content for reference.You might do this when you need: Domain-specific knowledge: If you want responses tailored to a particular domain, company, or industry, include content to help ChatGPT learn the terminology or best practices Consistent style and tone: Share content that will help ChatGPT emulate your brand or writing tone Fact-checking and accuracy: Supply ChatGPT with verified information or resources to help it produce more reliable responsesLet’s say you want ChatGPT to write a meta description for an existing article.To get the best results, briefly summarize the article's main points and specify any keywords you want included. You could even send some examples of meta descriptions you like as inspiration.Like this:Pro tipDon’t feed ChatGPT any sensitive personal or company information you don’t want available to anyone else. OpenAI stores queries, which the provider (and potentially its partners and contractors) can see. And according to OpenAI, “Your conversations may be reviewed by our AI trainers to improve our systems.” Plus, as more and more data gets stored online, the risk of it getting hacked grows. 3. Be SpecificClearly defined instructions help focus ChatGPT’s response. And avoids deviations or ambiguous outputs.Let’s say you’re looking for marketing advice on how to grow your small business’s online presence.A prompt like “talk about marketing strategies” is too broad and will likely give you vague advice.Like this:Instead, tailor your prompt to your specific requirements. For example, ask, “explain three effective digital marketing strategies for small businesses.”This way, you’re more likely to receive a helpful answer. Like this:4. Set ParametersSpecifying constraints in your prompt saves you time and lots of back and forth by forcing ChatGPT to target its responses.For example, you can ask ChatGPT to give you a certain number of words, characters, sentences, or even outputs.Let’s say you’re asking ChatGPT for help with writing headlines. You can ask it for a specific number of options:Alternatively, guide ChatGPT to adopt a specific viewpoint or consider a particular methodology while generating the response.5. Specify a FormatProviding the output format in a ChatGPT response helps guide the AI model to generate the content type you’re looking for.If you have a particular format you want, like a short story or meta description, state it explicitly. You can also ask the ChatGPT to list pros and cons, provide step-by-step instructions, or respond in any other format structure you want. Do you want the response in bullet point form or as a paragraph—or both?The more specific, the better.6. Tell ChatGPT to Act As a Specific RoleAssigning a specific role to ChatGPT—called “role specification”—gives it a clear context and persona. This way, it can tap into the knowledge and communication style associated with that role. And align its responses with the expertise and perspective you need for your task.For example, the prompt “Give me suggestions on improving my link-building efforts” will generate a generic response.Like this:But asking, \"As an experienced and professional SEO strategist, give me suggestions on how to improve my link-building efforts” yields more comprehensive, high-quality results. Like this:Depending on your industry, you can ask ChatGPT to act like an industry expert or even a system. Like an Excel sheet or a data analytics platform. 7. Refine the PromptsWhen ChatGPT doesn’t respond how you want, you can edit your original prompt. Or re-prompt it using different wording to get better results.Let’s say you’ve asked ChatGPT to give you three reasons why companies should invest in SEO. But ChatGPT’s response is too formal:One way to refine your prompt is by hovering over it and clicking the pencil icon.Then, update your prompt and click “Save.” ChatGPT will produce a new response. Like this:Alternatively, you can write a new prompt with more specific instructions.Pro tipAI models like ChatGPT can sometimes veer off topic, repeat previously generated responses, or even hallucinate (make things up.) In this case, start a new prompt (or even a brand new chat) to refocus the tool and get back on track.Speed Up Your Workflow with ChatGPT Prompts Once you know how to write ChatGPT prompts, you’ll be able to achieve more accurate outputs more quickly.These prompts are meant to inspire you to write your own prompts relevant to your business or product.Just remember to always review ChatGPT’s outputs for accuracy and ensure they have a human touch.Want more help with writing relevant and effective content?Try Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant.
