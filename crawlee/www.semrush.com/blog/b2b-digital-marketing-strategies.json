When B2B prospects visit your site, you want them to take action. That’s more likely to happen if your website is trustworthy, easy to navigate, mobile-friendly, and fast.Take Yext, a B2B company that helps others manage information about their business on different online platforms.The website copy instills trust by identifying Yext as a market leader. The call to action (CTA) is straightforward.Responsive design makes the site easy to navigate on a mobile device.The navigation changes so it’s user-friendly. And links are easy to click on a small screen. One key part of this site’s user-friendliness is that it loads quickly across devices. Forty-seven percent of consumers expect a website to load in two seconds or less. The probability of bounce almost triples if your page takes longer than three seconds to load, according to Google.Check your site speed with Site Audit, a Semrush tool that analyzes your domain to identifty technical site issues.

If not, check out the recommendations under “Performance Issues.” Follow the suggestions to address problems and speed up your site.3. Build a Solid Content Marketing PlanB2B content marketing is another strategic approach to growing your B2B business. It involves consistently creating and distributing valuable, relevant content to a clearly defined audience.Content marketing helps establish authority, grow trust, and convert new business online. Your marketing content comes in a variety of different formats, like: Articles Blog posts Case studies E-books Email campaigns Infographics Newsletters Podcasts Press releases Quizzes and surveys Slideshows Social media posts Videos Webinars WhitepapersA good content marketing strategy includes several of the above.Consider the below examples from customer service software solution Zendesk.There are in-depth guides for customer experience professionals on the Zendesk company blog.Its YouTube channel features everything from how-to product videos to interviews with other industry professionals.Animated images appear in LinkedIn channel posts to promote customer success stories with real-life results.Topic Research can help you generate ideas for your content.

Create Valuable Content for Each Stage of the Buying JourneyGenerally speaking, all customers go through three stages before purchase: Awareness: Becoming familiar with your company and product or service Consideration: Evaluating whether they need your product or service. If they decide they do, they may compare you with competitors. Decision: They opt to buy your product or services, resulting in a conversionCreate content that meets your target audience’s needs at each stage. Take Intuit’s blog, which supports and informs on its primary product: accounting software for businesses of all sizesThe company blog has an accounting category that publishes content for each stage of the buyer journey.For example, the article “Financial statements: What business owners should know” might be useful during awareness. Here, Intuit doesn’t ask readers to download Quickbooks. Instead, it simply informs readers about one type of report Quickbooks produces. And educates them about why it’s important.Another post showcases the reports Quickbooks produces for business owners. Because they’ve been convinced they need regular reporting.At the end of the article, Intuit softly pitches Quickbooks.Potential customers trying to decide which accounting software to purchase might be interested in the post titled “Accounting software selection: 7 factors to consider.”The Quickbooks mentions are more obvious throughout the different “factors to consider.” Because readers on this page are likely at the decision point and ready to convert.Create content at different stages of the buyer journey with multiple content types. Like videos, podcasts, and social media posts. To reach users with various learning styles. 5. Invest in Search Engine Optimization (SEO)SEO is a set of practices aimed at improving a website’s visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). It’s crucial for B2B digital marketing because Google sends more traffic to websites than any other platform.Out of all U.S. web traffic referrals from the top 170 sites, 63.41% were from Google.com. Image Source: SparkToroSEO includes optimizing your site’s content and structure for search engines. How?By targeting relevant keywords, creating high-quality content, and ensuring your site is user-friendly and technically sound.Use Keyword Magic Tool to find relevant keywords to target.Enter a seed keyword and an optional domain—for instance, “business consulting” and Deloitte. Click “Search.”TipSemrush will use AI to analyze how closely your domain’s main themes align with potential topics for your site.

Take Advantage of B2B Influencer MarketingInfluencer marketing is the practice of tapping into the audiences of influencers to market your business, products, or services.You’d typically pay an influencer to share your product or service in a social media post. For example, HubSpot sponsored a series with influencers on LinkedIn to promote its marketing certifications. The influencers went through the certification themselves and encouraged their followers to take them.Adobe worked with influencers on Instagram to promote its new AI assistant. In this example, Corporate Natalie plugs the tools in one of her humorous videos.Semrush’s Influencer Analytics app helps you identify, analyze, and manage influencers.
