A great report takes it one step further and tells the story of that data over a particular time period in relation to a goal. Did we achieve the goal, or are we on track to achieve the goal? Why or why not?The report needs to present the right data to answer these questions in a way the client will comprehend and not be overwhelmed by. Simplified and well-labeled graphs, charts, tables, icons, and colors are a great way to visually tell a story with a quick glance. Finally, a great report should be able to stand on its own, without the need for an in-person meeting all the time.”Roman ZelvenschiOwner, RomanZ Media Group Inc.“I deal with both reports that are sent to me and those that need to be delivered to the client. I think there is a bit of a difference between those.On the client side:On top of actually making clients money, we are also concerned with keeping them happy. As you know, good numbers don't guarantee a client, but bad ones will always get you fired.Clients don't really care about metrics that much; the majority of them don't understand them or cling to the ones that don't influence their marketing objectives. Even if you deal with a great marketing manager, they need to get approval for the budget from someone who doesn't know the difference between bounce and exit rate. That is why a great report for a client, from our perspective: Has a half-page summary that includes what has happened this month and why. Did our plan for last month work, and what are our future plans? Ideally will show them how you directly influenced the bottom line Has to tell a continuous story each month and be consistent. We can't adjust our interpretation to make numbers look good. So, we can't say one month, ‘The organic traffic is down, but the leads are up, and they are the only important thing,’ and next month, ‘Well leads are down, but look at all of this organic traffic.’ Provides all of the stats to support the summary at the beginning Clients are funny about the metrics they deem important. Often, they can have zero relevance to their particular business. Put those in the report too. Include something educational, as no matter how often you say things to clients, they will forget, so we need to repeat the same things many times. For example, ‘This double-digit growth is not sustainable, and we will be moving into protecting keyword positions and traffic maintenance stage in Q4.’On reports from my staff:I need a very clear understanding of what is actually happening with their business. If we are doing well, or we need to put more resources into the client, or the monthly report will be ugly. I need a daily report on things that are wrong (like disapproved ads or keywords) and what was done to fix them Weekly reports on where we are this month YoY on major metrics. Then an explanation of what is moving the numbers with data backup. For example, “organic traffic is down, mainly due to this keyword. We are in the same position for it, but the volume decreased, so there is nothing we can do with it.” For them to get that, they need to cross-reference Semrush, Google Search Console, Analytics, and a CRM system to make sure what they think is happening with numbers is correlated in each system We also report internally on different metrics at each stage of the marketing funnel. That way, we are not just looking at traffic>leads and trying to guess what is happening in between. We pull different levers to increase each stage of the funnel. It is way too granular for the client reporting, and again, most of the time is above their heads.”Kathleen GierDirector of Content Strategy, BuilderDesigns“How does a great marketing report differ from a good one? The most important element of a good report is approachability. It needs to reflect both the interest and knowledge level of your partners in a way that presents the information they want to see and not so much that it is overwhelming.How to make a report for a client (or boss) stand out from others? Have some fun with it! Brand your report and add color to make the data a little more exciting. We also like to add some short narratives below each chart that highlight what we think is important and why the results matter.”Michela MarzoliSEO & SEM Manager, Club del Sole“I believe a great marketing report should focus on three features: target, action, and data visualization.Target: KPI and marketing dashboards should reflect the final users’ needs. That means, focusing only on Macro-KPI if the users are on top management — such as ROI, LTV, and cost per acquisition. To that report, add processes for Middle Management users, such as conversion paths and attribution models. To that report, add Micro-KPI, if addressed to Specialists, such as CTR, CPC, and position changes.Action: Every report should be actionable. That means, giving the readers practical suggestions on what to do to improve the KPI. Even just a short phrase at the end of each Dashboard, such as: ‘invest more advertising budget on mobile devices, which drive the best conversion rates.’ This makes the role of the analyst more pragmatic and results-oriented.Data Visualization: Turn data into visual insights, seeking a compromise between creativity and simplicity. Don’t disrupt typical visualization conventions that users expect, such as color conventions (red=danger..) while trying to tell a compelling story, targeted at your final user.”Automate Marketing Reports with SemrushNow that you know how to create marketing reports and why they’re so important, it’s time to take it a step further.
