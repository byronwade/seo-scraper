  "content": "What Are Meta Keywords? Meta keywords are specific meta tags located in the HTML head section of a webpage containing a list of keywords that represent the content of the page for search engines. However, they are now largely disregarded by most major search engines due to misuse.The meta tag is placed in the <head> section of your webpage. And looks like this:<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Keyword1, Keyword2, Keyword3\">Should You Use Meta Keywords?No, you shouldn’t. And here’s why:Meta keywords are an outdated and irrelevant meta tag that has no impact on your rankings in major search engines like Google or Bing. In fact, using them could even hurt your SEO efforts, as they could be seen as a spam signal by some search engines. And can reveal your keyword strategy to your competitors. You should instead focus on other more important meta tags, such as the title tag and meta description.These can affect how your pages appear in search results. And influence visitor click-through rate. Make sure your pages have unique, descriptive, and relevant titles and meta descriptions that match search intent.
