  "content": "What Is E-E-A-T?E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) is a framework that Google’s human reviewers use to assess content quality.It’s defined in Google’s Search Quality Rater Guidelines—the handbook that reviewers (known as Quality Raters) use to provide feedback on search results.Trustworthiness is the central, most important concept:Google wants to deliver search results that have strong E-E-A-T. To protect its users from harm and give them the best possible experience.This is especially important when it comes to Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) topics—i.e., topics that can affect users’ well-being. Such as health and finance.So, if Quality Raters find that results have low E-E-A-T, Google may try to improve its ranking algorithms. What’s the Difference Between E-E-A-T and E-A-T?In December 2022, Google changed E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) to E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness).In other words, it added an “E” for “Experience.”Google likely did this so that Quality Raters could better evaluate the quality of search results. Because it recognizes the value that first-hand experience can add to content.For example, product reviews are more trustworthy when the reviewer has used the product themselves.We’ll talk more about the different elements of E-E-A-T next.Why Is E-E-A-T Important for SEO?E-E-A-T is important for search engine optimization (SEO) because it helps you create quality content that performs well in Google results. (And performs well with users.)To clarify, E-E-A-T is not a confirmed direct factor in Google’s ranking formula. But improving your E-E-A-T helps you align with Google’s definition of a good search result. Let’s break down the elements of E-E-A-T guidelines and why they matter:ExperienceFirst-hand experience with the subject matter allows you to provide: Tried-and-tested advice Authentic insights Unique opinionsSo, it’s often crucial in creating quality content.Consider this review for the board game Wingspan.The author talks about their personal experiences. And provides unique product photos.This experience allows them to create more insightful, unique content.If the writer hadn’t played the game, users wouldn’t trust their opinions on it. And Google wouldn’t want to rank their review highly.ExpertiseExpertise refers to your knowledge, skills, and credentials.For example, this health article is reviewed by a medical doctor:As a result, users are more likely to trust the information and advice provided. And Google may be more confident in ranking the content higher.The level of expertise required to create quality content depends on the page’s topic and purpose.For example, people searching for money-saving tips don’t always want advice from financial advisors (Expertise). Sometimes, they want real-life examples of strategies that worked for their peers (Experience). That’s part of why pages like the one below (from Reddit, a popular forum-based social media site) can rank highly:AuthoritativenessAuthoritativeness refers to your reputation as a reliable source.One way that Google gauges authoritativeness is by looking at your backlinks (links to your site from other sites). The higher the quantity, quality, and relevancy of backlinks, the more authoritative your site is perceived to be.For example, WebMD is a well-regarded medical site. Backlink Analytics data shows it has backlinks from more than 616K domains. Including reputable sites like apple.com and bbc.com:You can get an idea of your own authoritativeness with Semrush’s Authority Score (AS) metric. The higher the score out of 100, the stronger your backlink profile.Enter your domain into Backlink Analytics and click “Analyze.”Then, refer to the Authority Score section:TipOne of the easiest ways to get more high-quality backlinks is with Semrush’s Link Building Tool.Note: Backlinks are a key way to assess a website’s perceived authority, but they are not the only way. For example, Quality Raters may be instructed to look at what others say about a website’s authority.TrustworthinessTrustworthiness is informed by experience, expertise, and authoritativeness. But it’s also about protecting visitors from potential harm and giving them confidence in your website/content.So, you should ensure that: Your website is secure Your content is accurate, truthful, and up to date Users can get help if required You have relevant certifications, credentials, etc.Take AnnualCreditReport.com.It’s the only site authorized by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to provide free credit reports. And the site takes many measures to keep users safe.This helps the website establish a high level of trust.How to Improve Your E-E-A-THere are six practical ways to improve your site’s E-E-A-T for SEO:Create Helpful ContentCreate content that helps target audiences and showcases your brand’s expertise.That way, you can grow authority in your field.For example, REI is an outdoor apparel retailer.

Because there’s a lot of misinformation on the internet, and spreading it will damage your E-E-A-T.It’s also best practice to link to your sources. So readers know you’ve done your research and can verify your claims for themselves.For example, Healthline cites the academic journals it uses:Leverage User-Generated ContentUser-generated content (UGC) is content created by website/platform users rather than brands. For example, Amazon displays videos, photos, reviews, and Q&As from its customers:UGC can help you build trust because it can prove that you have happy customers. And allow visitors to learn from each other’s experiences.You can prompt users to create UGC by: Building UGC interfaces into your website (e.g., Amazon’s Q&A section) Sending review request emails to customers Running contests that require users to create contentStart Building Your E-E-A-TBuilding E-E-A-T can be a daunting prospect.
