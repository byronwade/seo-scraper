  "content": "What Is SEO Marketing?SEO (search engine optimization) marketing is a digital marketing strategy used to improve a website’s visibility on search engines like Google and Bing. Helping you attract more organic (unpaid) traffic to your website and drive more sales. It involves creating helpful, people-first content for your target audience. And optimizing it for search engines. SEO marketing also involves improving your website’s technical performance so it delivers a great user experience.The higher your website ranks on search engines for relevant keywords, the more organic traffic it’s likely to receive. Further resulting in increased brand awareness and sales.SEO vs. PPC MarketingWhen someone enters a query into a search engine, they see a search engine results page (SERP). The SERP is usually made up of paid ads and organic (unpaid) results.SEO marketing can improve your website’s visibility in organic search engine results. Your site can appear higher in SERPs, without having to pay for placement.With pay-per-click (PPC) marketing, your website can appear in the paid ads section(s) of the SERP. It involves running ads that you pay for each time someone clicks on them. While SEO marketing may involve some investment, you can see long-term results with no direct cost. But with PPC, the results stop when you stop funding the campaign.Both methods can drive traffic to your website, but they operate in different ways.Here are the main differences between SEO and PPC: SEO Marketing PPC Marketing Traffic Takes time to achieve results Potential for immediate traffic Visibility Gradual increase in visibility as rankings improve Almost instant visibility in SERPs Sustainability Potential for long-lasting results Short-term results that depend on your budget Control Less control over rankings, dependent on algorithm changes Control over ad placement and targeting options Cost No direct cost per click or ranking Costs incurred per click Further reading: SEO vs. PPC: What the Differences Are & When to Use EachSEO Marketing vs. SEMSearch engine marketing (SEM) is a digital marketing strategy that leverages both SEO and PPC to improve your website’s visibility in search engines. You don’t need to use SEO and PPC simultaneously within an SEM strategy. But integrating both can provide a comprehensive approach that can significantly improve your site’s search engine visibility.For example, Zapier, a company that offers workflow automation software, creates SEO-friendly content. Which it also advertises to maximize visibility.The same post also ranks organically in the SERPs:SEO marketing focuses solely on organic search results.Here are the main differences between SEO and SEM: SEO Marketing SEM Marketing Strategies Focuses on optimizing for organic search results Combines both SEO for organic results and PPC for paid results Visibility Gradual increase in visibility as rankings improve Boosts visibility quickly with paid ads while also improving organic search rankings Cost More cost-effective in the long run as organic search rankings can be long-lasting Can be more expensive due to the inclusion of PPC Traffic Takes time to achieve results Can generate immediate traffic through PPC while increasing organic traffic with SEO Control Less control over rankings, dependent on algorithm changes Can have more control via PPC, but the SEO element still lacks control over rankings Further reading: SEO vs. SEM: Differences in Techniques, Costs, & ResultsThe Benefits of SEO MarketingSEO marketing can help you:Attract More Traffic to Your SiteSEO marketing can help your site rank higher for the keywords your target audience searches for. And the higher your site ranks in SERPs, the higher the expected click-through rate (CTR). And the more traffic you can expect to receive.More people clicking through to your site can lead to more sales for your business.Increase Brand AwarenessWhen your site appears higher in search results, it can also put your brand in front of more potential customers. Helping you increase brand awareness.When users see your site consistently appearing in search results, they begin to associate your brand with authority and trustworthiness. Building a strong brand reputation.And when people find your content valuable, they’re more likely to share it with their own networks. And further amplify your brand’s reach.Like this:Drive More Sales and RevenueSEO marketing can help you attract more potential customers to your site. And lead to more sales and revenue for your business. But whether your website visitors actually make a purchase depends on several factors, including: How well optimized your site is The amount of value your content provides How appealing your offer is The user’s intent behind searching for that contentTo drive more conversions, target buyer intent keywords. These terms indicate a higher likelihood of the searcher being ready to make a transaction. Rather than just seeking information.For example, the keyword “best influencer marketing tools” has a higher purchase intent than the keyword “what is influencer marketing.” Someone searching for “what is influencer marketing” is likely looking to learn more about this marketing method. But someone searching for the best tools is likely ready (or almost ready) to buy one of them.There are two types of buyer intent keywords: Commercial keywords: The user is researching products/services (e.g., “best cast iron skillet”) Transactional keywords: The user is ready to make a purchase (e.g., “buy cast iron skillet”)Use Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool to identify keywords with high-purchase intent.Start by entering a seed keyword. These are broad terms related to your industry, product, service, or business. Or enter your domain for personalized keyword data for your website. Then, click “Search.”The tool will present a list of related keywords. Along with additional information for each one. Like: Volume: The average number of monthly searches for that keyword Search Intent: The reason behind the user’s query Keyword Difficulty (KD%): An estimate of how difficult it would be to rank for that keyword, on a scale of 0-100 Personalized Keyword Difficulty (PKD%): An estimate of how difficult it would be for your domain to rank in the top 10 search results for that keywordUse filters to identify keywords with high-purchase intent. Simply click the “Intent”filter. And apply “Commercial” and/or “Transactional.” Then click “Apply.”Use the “KD%” filter to find keywords that are “possible” or easier to rank for by setting a custom range of 0-49 (or select your own target difficulty). Then click “Apply.”If you’ve entered your domain, use the “PKD” filter instead.Ideally, target keywords with high search volume but low keyword difficulty (or Personal Keyword Difficulty). Then, add these keywords to your content to drive targeted traffic to your pages through SEO marketing.Types of SEO MarketingOn-Page SEOOn-page SEO involves optimizing your webpages and their content for both users and search engines. Like including your target keywords (which we found in the previous section) in a few key areas of your content:Title TagYour title tag is an HTML element that specifies the title of your webpage. It can show up in search results and at the top of a browser's window or tab. Including your target keyword here is a great way to tell Google and your users what your content is about.Meta DescriptionYour meta description offers a brief summary of your webpage, giving users and search engines a preview of the content. It can appear below the title tag in search results.Including your keywords here won’t influence your rankings. But it can boost your click-through rate by showing readers that your content is relevant to their search query.H1 TagAn H1 tag is an HTML element that is often used to display the main headline or primary subject of the webpage.As with the title tag, it makes sense to include your target keyword here to make it clear to Google and users what your content is about.Alt TextAlt text describes the content of an image, aiding search engines in interpreting visual information.Alt text also helps visually impaired people understand what the image shows. And it can appear if the image fails to load.Along with optimizing each of these elements, on-page SEO also involves: Writing unique and helpful content Using headings and subheadings to structure your webpages Making your URL slugs SEO-friendly Adding useful internal and external links Naturally incorporating target keywords throughout the contentUse Semrush’s On Page SEO Checker to enhance your on-page SEO efforts.

This includes selecting your target location and adding URLs of webpages you want to optimize. Along with setting target keywords. Once you’ve configured your project, you’ll be taken to the “Overview” section. In the “TOP pages to optimize” section, click on the “# ideas” button next to any of the URLs to view recommendations for that specific page.The content section provides guidance on naturally incorporating your keywords in title tags, H1 tags, meta descriptions, and the body of the page.In the “Semantic” section, you’ll find related keywords to naturally incorporate into your text for further optimization.Work through these optimizations to improve your on-page SEO. And to help drive more targeted traffic to your website.Technical SEOTechnical SEO involves improving your website’s technical performance so it delivers a good user experience. To influence your rankings and conversion rates.It’s also about making it easy for search engines to find, understand, and index your content.Here are some key technical SEO elements to focus on: HTTPS: Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) securely transmits data between web browsers and servers.

For solutions, click on the “Why and how to fix it” link for a concise explanation of the problem and actionable steps to resolve it. Work through these issues to improve your site’s technical SEO. Making it easier for search engines to find and understand your content. And to provide a better user experience.Off-Page SEOOff-page SEO refers to the tactics you implement outside of your website to help it rank better in search results.
