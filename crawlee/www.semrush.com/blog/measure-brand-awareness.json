Social ListeningSocial listening lets you track brand mentions on social media, blogs, forums, or news websites. Helping you measure brand awareness on the basis of how often your brand is coming up in conversation.Social listening also helps you understand audience sentiment, which is how people feel about and perceive your brand. For example, say you’re a pizza restaurant that’s launched a new deep-pan crust. You use social listening to measure how many people mention your restaurant online. Which indicates brand awareness. And how they feel about your new pizza, which tells you audience sentiment.When using social listening, look at the following metrics: Overall brand mentions Positive brand mentions Negative brand mentions Neutral brand mentionsUse a social listening tool like Media Monitoring to measure brand mentions, reach, awareness, and audience sentiment.Find Media Monitoring in the Semrush App Center, under \"Categories\" > \"Media Monitoring.\"To get started, simply enter two branded keywords or hashtags. Select your language. Then, click “Create Project.”Media Monitoring will look for mentions of your keywords and generate a report with its findings. For example, the “Summary” tab shows your latest brand mentions. And a graph of mention volume by date. If this number is increasing, it’s an indication more people are becoming aware of your brand.Look at your “Presence” score to measure your brand’s popularity for a specified time frame. Use this metric to measure brand awareness and set benchmarks.Click the “Mentions” tab to review all your mentions sorted by date. And see the sentiment for each one. Including neutral, positive, and negative. Click on the “Analysis” tab to learn more about your reach and awareness. For example: Mentions over a specific time period Brand reach (an estimate of how many impressions the posts featuring your brand have received) How people feel about your business The most influential websites that mention your brandTipYou can track your daily mentions and perform social listening with Brand Monitoring, also found in the Semrush App Center.2. Share of VoiceShare of voice (SOV) measures how much your brand is seen or heard in the market compared to your competitors.This helps you see: Brand presence: Understand how much of your market's attention your brand captures. For example, a business with high SOV could receive lots of media coverage or have an increased presence in search engine results pages (SERP).

For example, a higher SOV could mean your brand is more well-known vs. other businesses in your market or industry. Marketing effectiveness: Use share of voice to assess the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns. Increasing your SOV may correlate with improved brand awareness, engagement, and consideration.Measure your share of voice by comparing your website traffic, social followers/engagement, and paid advertising placements against competitors in your industry or market.Then, use that information to adjust your marketing strategy.For example, if you notice that Competitor 3 has a higher SOV on social media than you, focus on improving your social media content strategy to increase your share of voice.To find your website traffic share of voice metric, use Position Tracking.

Web TrafficMonitor web traffic to see how many people visit your site and where they came from.This is similar to counting the number of visitors to a brick-and-mortar store. It gives you a clear indication of whether your brand awareness is improving or not.Measure the following metrics: Direct traffic: Visitors who land on your site by typing the URL into their browser, using a bookmark, or clicking a link in an email Referral traffic: Visitors who land on your site via a link from another website Organic traffic: Visitors who land on your site from search engine results pages Organic social traffic: Visitors who land on your site from organic social media posts New visitors: People visiting your site for the first time Returning visitors: Visitors who have visited your site before and are returning for a new visit Page views: The number of times visitors view pages on your website Time on site: The amount of time a visitor spends on your website in a sessionAn increase in traffic (for example, organic social traffic) indicates more people may be becoming aware of your business.

As audiences get more familiar with your brand, there’s more opportunity for them to start progressing through your marketing funnel. And the more potential customers that enter the funnel at the top, the more can become a customer at the conversion stage. A conversion is a predetermined action that’s valuable to your business. For example, purchasing a product, signing up for a course, joining a newsletter, or downloading a resource.Conversions can’t happen without awareness building first. So, measuring your conversion rate over time can help you understand the impact of brand awareness campaigns.Conversions could come from: Pay-per-click (PPC) ads: Digital advertising where companies pay each time their ad is clicked Paid social ads: Social media content paid to reach an audience broader than your following Content marketing: The creation and distribution of content (e.g., blog posts, whitepapers, ebooks, or webinars) that engage your target audience Email marketing: Sending email campaigns to a targeted or segmented group of subscribersUse Google Analytics to see conversion rates on your website. You’ll need to set up conversion tracking first by creating events.Then, navigate to GA4 and go to “Reports” > “Lifecycle” > “Acquisition” > “Traffic acquisition.”Then, click on the pencil icon in the upper-right corner.Find “Metrics.”Then, click “Add metric.” And look for “Session key event rate.” Then, click “Apply.”You should now see “Session conversion rate” in your “Traffic acquisition report.”Here, you can see the conversion rate for each channel. Which helps you know which areas to focus your marketing efforts on.For example, if organic search generates a higher conversion rate than organic social, consider whether you need to double down on your SEO strategy to continue this trend.7. Customer Surveys and ReviewsMeasure brand awareness by getting direct feedback from your customers and audience. Use a survey to ask questions about brand recognition and familiarity. For example, you could show an image of your brand logo and ask if customers recognize it and where they saw it.Or create a survey about how customers perceive your brand and its reputation to gain a deeper understanding of your brand image. Alternatively, use a Net Promoter Score (NPS). NPS gives you an indication of customer loyalty. And how likely a customer is to spread word-of-mouth recommendations about your brand. Which is a positive reflection of brand awareness improving.NPS surveys often ask direct questions, such as “How likely are you to recommend our product/service to a friend or colleague?”The survey responses are then broken down into three groups: Promoters (scores of 9-10): Enthusiastic, happy, and loyal customers who are likely to promote your brand to others Passives (scores of 7-8): Satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who could be tempted by a competitor's offering Detractors (scores of 0-6): Unhappy customers who can damage the brand through negative word-of-mouthAn NPS score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters: NPS = % Promoters − % DetractorsFor example, you survey 100 customers. 50% are promoters, 30% are passives, and 20% are detractors. Your NPS score would be 30.NPS scores vary by industry, but scores of 0 or less signal customer satisfaction issues that need to be immediately addressed. A score of 30+ is considered good, and 50+ is excellent.Pro tipPlatforms like Delighted can help you send NPS surveys and track feedback.You’ll also want to track your reviews and star ratings on third-party websites like Yelp and Google. Look at your average star rating. A high score indicates a positive brand reputation. And an increase in the volume of customer ratings could also mean that more people are becoming aware of your brand. 8.

The KPIs and benchmarks for influencer marketing will depend on what you’re looking to achieve by partnering with influencers. For example, are you looking to generate leads or brand awareness?Here are some common KPIs to measure the impact of influencer campaigns on brand awareness: Engagement rate Leads captured Website trafficDepending on your goal, make sure you set your influencer campaign up for success by ensuring you can measure the results.
