  "content": "In case you missed it, Girlboss and Semrush teamed up to kick off the year with a webinar, led by an expert panel made up of Girlboss’ Social Media Manager Cheska Castro, Head of Content & Comms at Island Jess Cook, Co-Founder and COO of Landing, Miri Buckland and Julia Holmqvist, Semrush’s Social Media Manager.We discussed all the ins and outs of social media in 2024, to give the best tips for building an authentic, values-driven brand using the power of social media. While the hour-long talk with social-media marketing experts and entrepreneurs tackled a lot of issues and unpacked emerging platform trends, we couldn’t get to everyone’s questions. But now the good news: in this article, we’ll address all the most interesting, important and relevant questions—from planning for Threads to what’s going on with hashtags and how to prioritize platforms for your brand, with thought leadership from Julia Holmqvist. Answering Your Questions About Platforms Threads and XWhat are your thoughts on Instagram Threads, and do you think it’s important for businesses to be active on this platformThreads has had rapid growth over the last year, thanks in part to offering an alternative to the overproduced, high-lift approach to content seen on other platforms. Instead, Threads lowers the bar to entry through simple, casual storytelling. Threads is great for promoting new launches and getting eyes on your services and product lines. You can use it to build a sense of anticipation, as well as to get an almost instant pulse-check on whether your brand resonates with your audience and customers, getting feedback in seconds. Beyond simple content, Threads sets the stage for Q&A sessions that help foster a sense of community, while encouraging feedback. This can help you or your brand build deeper connections and strategic insights. Nail your Threads strategy, and you’ll unlock a sense of exclusivity and build true connection with your followers.Should companies stay or move away from X?As for now, don't count X out of the game yet. We've seen a surge in interest in the platform compared to Q3 in 2023. I would still put some effort into the platform if your audience is active there. Maybe hold back on spending a lot of money on ads if you feel unsure if it's a platform right for your brand.Julia Holmqvist, Social Media Manager at SemrushLinkedInWhat key tactics should a new social media manager employ to build a LinkedIn presence and increase brand visibility effectively? Is it worth it to cross-post content to Facebook, etc.?“When you’re just getting started on LinkedIn, cross-posting is fine, especially if you're trying to gain some traction to your brand,” says Julia. “On LinkedIn, it’s recommended to start posting three times per week, and to do a lot of proactive commenting under other brands' or people’s social media posts. Collaborate with interesting influencers that could create content for you and cross-post it on their channels.”Finally, Julia recommends “zeroing in on a niche to build brand awareness first, instead of focusing on a really broad topic, like digital marketing.” For B2B companies, what’s more important on LinkedIn—engagement or impressions?Impressions and engagement are the top two metrics for your LinkedIn strategy. Try not to prioritize one over the other, but instead, understand how they relate to each other. Then, use that knowledge to power your content and strategy. One tip is to define your goals, whether that’s exposure or engagement. Next, assess your strategy. Are you after visibility or building a deeper relationship with your audience? Establish your metrics (click-through rates, conversions, benchmark achievements). Finally, work out the balance between short-term and long-term goals to figure out a happy medium between immediate wins and long-term, evergreen engagement. Keep in mind that LinkedIn is first and foremost a platform for building professional relationships, where you can post a variety of content to promote your offering. It’s important to understand the metrics and leverage them in the right ways to boost not only your visibility, but also your influence on the platform. What are the best ways to increase brand relatability on LinkedIn?When it comes to standing out on LinkedIn, Julia says to “chime in in industry discussions and prioritize proactive commenting. Solve problems for your audience before they realize they had that problem.” What are your thoughts on the rise of company employees as influencers on LinkedIn?Julia believes that employee advocacy is a powerful tool for brands.When employees speak positively about their company on social media or in other public forums, it'll boost brand trust. It's like having a team of brand ambassadors promoting your company for free. Plus, it humanizes the brand and can attract top talent.How many hashtags do you recommend for maximum engagement?According to LinkedIn’s own platform recommendations, you should stick with two hashtags: one with millions of followers and another, more niche hashtag with just a few thousand followers. For example, if you’re talking about growth marketing, use the popular hashtag #marketing (millions of followers) and the less-followed #SEOtips (which has around 14K followers).When do you recommend starting B2B marketing efforts on LinkedIn, especially concerning content and paid ads vs. organic?“If you don't understand what works on the organic side of the platform, throwing money on ads will probably not give you the results you're looking for,” says Julia “LinkedIn is one of the most expensive platforms to run advertisements on, so focus on organic marketing efforts first and then set a paid strategy.”.Instagram When it comes to the captions and descriptions on Instagram, can you share any SEO insights? Reverse engineer this solution by coming up with the specific search terms people would use to find content like yours, and then incorporate those terms into your content. Hashtags shouldn't be just an afterthought.Use Semrush's Position Tracking tool to see which keywords are driving traffic to your website and Keyword Overview to discover other related keywords you can test in your Instagram posts.You can also use the Instagram search bar to discover relevant keyphrases. Start typing a keyword in the search bar, and you’ll see suggested keyword phrases you could add to your existing keyword list.Instagram’s own best practices recommend that creators use 3 to 5 hashtags on posts, even though they allow up to 30 (more is not always better). Remember: on Instagram, hashtags function like keywords, so use the ones you want to be known for. Are Stories still relevant for Instagram?Instagram Stories should be a key part of your strategy, as they affect the platform’s most important metric: engagement. What’s more, this format is playful, encouraging follower interaction, and can be a terrific awareness-builder for creating engaged audiences. TikTok When it comes to TikTok and Instagram, how much time and effort is necessary to find success?Achieving success on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram requires a strategic approach, including creative content creation and active engagement. The commitment varies by your objectives, audience, and success metrics. For TikTok, success hinges on producing original videos, engaging with the audience, posting regularly, and learning platform trends. Instagram demands varied high-quality content, community engagement, consistent posting, and an understanding of its algorithms. Key strategies include planning your goals and themes, managing your time efficiently, maintaining patience and persistence, adapting strategies based on analytics, and balancing effort with expected outcomes. Essentially, success on these platforms is a long-term endeavor, driven by creativity, consistent effort, and engagement, all tailored to your specific goals.How do you find keywords for specific posts or campaigns on TikTok?TikTok automatically fills the search bar with trending keywords relevant to your search. Review the suggestions and choose any that align with your content. For additional keyword ideas, consider entering your main keyword followed by a single letter.Use Semrush's Position Tracking tool to see which keywords are driving traffic to your website and Keyword Overview to uncover other related keywords to test in your TikTok posts.Is it important to edit videos in TikTok before posting in order to have more reach and engagement?Adding captions to videos can boost your TikTok account's reach and engagement, which is essential for growth. Modify your captions' color, font, alignment, background or font size to enhance your content's appeal. This strategy is vital for expanding your audience and increasing interaction on TikTok.How do you create a niche on TikTok without it becoming random in how it pushes content?Julia recommends using hashtags appropriately and creating niched content to get your brand on the right \"toks.”YouTubeIs YouTube still a relevant platform for brand awareness, for example, for a sportswear company?YouTube has become an important platform for enhancing brand awareness. Its large audience and broad exposure provide an excellent opportunity for brands, including sportswear, to present their products or services. The platform's combination of visual and audio elements supports compelling storytelling, engaging viewers effectively.Is it worth putting energy into posting content in YouTube Shorts?Exploring YouTube Shorts, it's clear they offer the benefits of increased brand reach and accessibility. By diversifying content types, we address the diverse preferences of our audience, enhancing brand credibility. Short-form videos have become a staple for businesses, from startups to large corporations, generating significant interest.Here are some of the key advantages: YouTube prefers content that maintains viewer engagement, which short-form videos typically achieve by encouraging viewers to watch fully. A dedicated section for Shorts in the YouTube app boosts visibility for businesses of all sizes, allowing them to stand out among larger competitors. Shorts act as introductory content that can boost subscriber numbers on the platform.To fully leverage YouTube Shorts, it's crucial to share them across social networks like Instagram and Facebook, and to mention them in newsletters. Encouraging interactions from your audience, such as likes, comments, and shares can further amplify their reach and engagement.What is the most useful social media management platform?Different social media management platforms address specific business needs. Try Semrush's Social Media Management tool if you're looking for comprehensive and easy-to-use SM publishing, scheduling and analytics tools.Answering Your Questions About Strategy Comparing PlatformsDo you compare across platforms? If so, what is the main metric for a fair comparison?As Semrush’s social media manager, Julia Holmqvist, says,“I wouldn't advise comparing across platforms because a) the goal is different, b) the success rate is different, and c) the audience is different.”What’s the lift for each platform? Do some platforms take more time than others?The effort and time needed to succeed on various social media platforms can vary widely. This difference stems from each platform's distinctive features, the expectations of its audience, the types of content favored, and the workings of its algorithms. Here is a short summary of the effort levels for the major social media platforms:InstagramHigh Effort: Achieving success on Instagram typically demands premium visual content, regular updates, and active interaction with followers. The platform offers Stories, posts, and Reels, each requiring a unique strategy and creative input.TikTokMedium to High Effort: TikTok's algorithm may give an edge to content from newer creators, making quick growth possible. Yet, producing creative, captivating content that catches the audience's attention necessitates continuous creativity and effort, along with engaging in trending challenges.FacebookMedium Effort: Facebook's extensive user base notwithstanding, organic reach is increasingly tough to achieve due to algorithm modifications. Success here often involves a blend of compelling content, community engagement, and targeted ads to boost visibility.X (Formerly Twitter)Medium Effort: X requires constant interaction and timely, relevant content that resonates with current discussions or trends. Success on this platform is for those adept at crafting sharp, engaging content and regularly participating in discussions.LinkedInLow to Medium Effort: Given LinkedIn's professional setting, content tends to have a longer shelf life, and organic reach for business-focused content can be considerable. Still, producing insightful, sector-specific content that captivates professionals demands careful planning.YouTubeHigh Effort: YouTube calls for labor-intensive content creation, emphasizing quality video production and SEO. Audience growth is gradual, necessitating ongoing content delivery and viewer engagement.PinterestLow to Medium Effort: Pinterest focuses more on content discovery than social interaction. Achieving success involves creating visually attractive pins and search optimization. Although it can generate significant web traffic, it doesn't require as much regular interaction as other platforms.How often do you suggest posting on each social media platform?Posting frequency should be tailored to each social media platform, requiring experimentation to find what works best for your profiles. Instagram Posting Frequency Experts suggest posting at least three times a week on Instagram, incorporating a mix of carousels, Reels, and static posts. This variety is especially important if posting more frequently. For Instagram Stories, posting twice daily is advisable for optimal engagement.TikTok Posting FrequencyFor beginners on TikTok, posting 3-5 times a week is a good start, although TikTok itself recommends a more aggressive approach of 1-4 posts a day. Starting with a manageable 3-5 posts weekly can be an effective strategy.Facebook Posting FrequencyIt's recommended to post once or twice a day on Facebook to stay visible without overwhelming your audience's feed.X Posting FrequencyGiven X's fast-paced nature and the transient relevance of tweets, posting 2-3 times a day is recommended to stay engaged with the platform's rhythm.LinkedIn Posting FrequencyPosting once or twice a day on LinkedIn is advised. LinkedIn indicates that weekly posts can double engagement, suggesting even daily posts, including weekends, for optimal results.Pinterest Posting FrequencyPosting at least once a week on Pinterest is recommended, prioritizing content quality and relevance over frequency. However, a weekly posting schedule can provide a consistent framework.2024 Trends and Predictions What are your thoughts and suggestions on campaign trends for 2024?Leading content marketing trends for 2024 involve: employing artificial intelligence to boost human creative efforts; concentrating on specialized niche marketing; utilizing AI for search engine optimization enhancements; and integrating video content created by AI to captivate audiences.For more ideas, check out Semrush's new Social Media Trends Report 2024, which features expertise and predictions from top world marketing experts.What formats are worth exploring in 2024 for knowledge-sharing with your audience?According to Julia Holmqvist's expertise, podcasts are still huge, and filmed podcasts can be repurposed into short format TikToks and Reels.Prioritizing Platforms Is it better to focus on one or two platforms rather than all when starting a new online retail business?For new online retail ventures, it tends to be more advantageous to concentrate on just one or two social media channels for several critical reasons: Resource optimization: Focusing energy and resources on a limited number of platforms leads to higher quality content and more meaningful engagement without diluting efforts. Focused interaction: This strategy enables a targeted approach to connecting with and engaging your specific audience, increasing the likelihood of impactful interactions and conversions. Easier data analysis: With fewer platforms to monitor, analyzing performance data becomes more straightforward, allowing for faster adjustments to strategies based on insights. Depth over breadth: Establishing a robust presence on a select few platforms can have a greater impact than a weak presence across many, by capitalizing on the specific advantages to your brand of the chosen platforms. Selecting appropriate platforms: Opt for platforms that match your content creation strengths, whether visual storytelling on Instagram or fostering community on Facebook.Ultimately, a targeted approach to social media strategy can improve efficiency, engagement, and flexibility, creating a strong platform for business growth.If a brand can be on only one social media platform, what should it be?Be on the platform where your audience is. Don't pick a platform based on which one you like personally or what's ‘in '. Pick one where your audience will be most of the time.Julia Holmqvist, Social Media Manager at SemrushWhat if you’re just one person trying to build a personal brand?“Focus on one platform first and build your brand around that platform,” says Julia. “Repurpose content and schedule content in advance. It's better to stay consistent and post less than to try to post several times a week and then give up after a month. Take a course on personal branding to elevate your skills.”.Almost 70% of the customers that acquire our services are aged between 44 and 65+. In your experience, is there a preferred social media for that target audience?According to the Marketing Charts report, Facebook continues to be the preferred social media platform for Americans aged 50 and over. Approximately 71% of individuals in this age group reported using Facebook—up from 68% the previous year. YouTube remains the second most popular platform among this demographic, with 51% usage, similar to the previous year's 52%. The survey, conducted in September and October 2022, also showed that Instagram's usage rose by 4 percentage points among those 50 and older, from 24% the year before to 28%. This makes it the third most popular platform in this age bracket. TikTok saw a significant relative increase, with usage climbing from 10% in 2021 to 15% in the latest survey. Moreover, the proportion of adults over 50 who engage with social media has increased, with only 12% reporting no use of any social media platforms, down from 15% the previous year.SEO and Keywords How can I find the best hashtags or SEO keywords?Finding the best hashtags for social media and the best SEO keywords for content enhancement requires careful research and strategic planning. Here’s a step-by-step approach to navigating each effectively.For Hashtags: Utilize social media features: Use the search functions on platforms like Instagram, X, and TikTok to discover related hashtags and their popularity. Study competitor tactics: Examine the hashtags employed by similar profiles or competitors with high engagement levels. Employ hashtag discovery tools: Utilize platforms such as Hashtagify, RiteTag, or All Hashtag to find trending and pertinent hashtags related to your initial keyword or theme. Stay up-to-date on sector trends: Monitor current trends in your field to incorporate prevalent hashtags, thereby enhancing your content's reach. Experiment and evaluate: Test various hashtags to identify which elicit the strongest engagement from your audience.For SEO Keywords: Utilize keyword research instruments: Employ tools like Semrush's Keyword Overview to uncover high-traffic, low-competition keywords in your niche. Understand query intent: Grasp the purpose behind search queries—informational, transactional, etc.—and select keywords that align with your content's objective. Conduct competitor keyword research: Investigate the keywords for which your competitors rank, identifying opportunities for differentiation or direct competition. Prioritize long-tail keywords: Concentrate on long-tail keywords, which are more detailed and often longer than three words, for their lower competition and more explicit intent. Track keyword success: Monitor your selected keywords' performance with SEO monitoring tools like Semrush's Position Tracking to see rankings, traffic, and conversions, and tweak your approach as needed.Best Exercises and TipsWhat are your dos and don'ts when it comes to an agency that wants to grow on social media as an industry leader, but still be authentic?Social media guidelines won't unlock the secrets of Instagram's algorithm or guarantee rapid TikTok growth. However, they offer a strategic blueprint for digital marketing success. Here's a condensed guide on what to embrace and avoid:Dos: Define objectives: Without clear goals, it becomes challenging to assess the effectiveness of social media efforts and justify the need for additional resources. Implement branding standards: Establish clear guidelines for your brand's tone, style, and visual identity to ensure consistency across all content. Focus on storytelling: Emphasize narratives in your content strategy to foster memorable connections and emotional engagement with your audience, thus enhancing brand recall and interaction.Don'ts: Avoid overextending: Resist the urge to have a presence on every social platform. Select networks that align with your brand's demographics and content strategy. Plan ahead: Rather than improvising, develop a flexible plan using a social media calendar to streamline content creation and execution. Keep experimenting: Use established best practices as a foundation, but remain open to exploring new content formats and strategies to maintain audience interest and achieve your objectives.Any tips for planning and marketing the launch of a new e-commerce brand? Before launching an e-commerce brand, it’s essential to establish a solid foundation for your product. Know your target market: A pivotal aspect of any successful e-commerce product introduction is understanding your audience. Identifying what they seek, anticipate, and struggle with allows you to customize your product more effectively. Employ analytical tools to delve into your target market's demographic details, behaviors, and preferences, which will inform your product development and strategic planning. Develop a unique selling proposition (USP): Given that a significant portion of e-commerce ventures fail due to a lack of uniqueness, it's vital to ensure your product distinguishes itself. Your USP should succinctly communicate what makes your product unique and why it should be chosen over the competition. Stimulate pre-launch interest: Successful pre-launch marketing efforts do more than just alert potential customers: they generate enthusiasm and interest. Leverage social media, email marketing, and partnerships with influencers to convey engaging narratives and details about your product. Teasers, previews, and exclusive promotions can attract your audience, creating eagerness and a loyal following before your product is even available.What strategies can travel brands employ to encourage the sharing of user-generated content (UGC) on their social media platforms in 2024?“Run competitions and giveaways on TikTok,” recommends Julia.This is a huge platform right now to get more user-generated content if you don't have any. You can also automate the UGC journey by using tools like TINT that have everything from a library of videos to covering the legal aspect.What platforms are the best for generating conversations for B2B companies? LinkedIn: For those in the B2B realm, LinkedIn stands out as the premier platform. Boasting over 830 million members, it's a hub for professional networking and lead generation, particularly celebrated among software marketing professionals for its reliability.Indeed, 40% of B2B marketers acknowledge LinkedIn as the top tool for securing high-quality leads. If your goal is to engage prospective clients and guide them through the software purchasing process, consider these strategies on LinkedIn: Engage in LinkedIn Groups to forge connections with potential clients. Contribute valuable, original content on LinkedIn Pulse. Network with industry thought leaders. X (formerly Twitter): With its 465 million monthly active users, X excels as a platform for instant interaction, making it a potent tool for software marketers aiming to connect instantly and foster relationships. A notable 54% of B2B companies integrate X into their marketing mix to cultivate prospects and convert them into dedicated clients. X is suited to those seeking to reach a broad audience quickly, participate in discussions, and share useful insights. Facebook: As the behemoth of social media platforms, Facebook's 2.9 billion monthly users make it an unmatched marketing resource for connecting empathetically with prospects, discerning their challenges, and engaging with them on a personal note.Although not traditionally viewed as a B2B platform, software marketers shouldn't disregard Facebook. It offers an array of features and targeting options, including lead capture forms, custom audiences, lookalike audiences, and dynamic ads, enabling B2B marketers to target and captivate their desired demographic effectively.How do you handle low reach and engagement?Overcoming low reach and engagement on social media requires strategic actions to pinpoint and rectify the issues. Follow these steps to enhance your social media performance: Content Review Focus on quality: Ensure your content is relevant, of high quality, and delivers value to your audience. The lack of interest may stem from content that fails to engage your followers. Diversify your content: Test various content forms (videos, images, polls, stories) to discover your audience's preferences.2. Utilize Audience Insights Analyze your social media analytics to understand your audience's demographics and peak activity times. Adjusting your content and schedule accordingly can boost engagement. Identify engagement trends: Analyze high-performing posts for common features to guide your future content strategy.3. Find optimal posting timesUse analytics to determine when your audience is most likely to be online, and schedule your posts for these peak times. This will help to improve visibility and interaction.4. Optimize Hashtags and Keywords Strategize with hashtags: Select relevant hashtags to enhance your content's visibility without overdoing it, and focus on those that align with your audience and niche. Use keywords effectively: Integrate pertinent keywords into your posts to boost searchability and relevance.5. Community interaction Make an effort to interact with your followers by replying to comments, messages, and participating in their content, which will help foster a vibrant community.What kind of content works best for corporate B2B clients, and which platform is best? User-Generated Content (UGC): UGC refers to any content created by users or a brand’s online community—such as customers showcasing products in use, or sharing experiences on social media with brand-promoted hashtags. UGC's advantages are notable: it harnesses word-of-mouth marketing and serves as social proof, thereby enhancing your brand's authenticity and credibility. Interactive Content: Integrating interactive elements into B2B marketing materials brings several benefits. It places potential customers at the forefront of the content, giving them control over their engagement and exploration journey. Interactive content fosters deeper connections and is more likely to leave a lasting impression, thus enhancing engagement and recall. Downloadable Templates: In the B2B sector, downloadable templates are incredibly valuable. While not every company can offer templates that aid their audience's work or personal organization, those that do so provide a significant utility. Offering templates that simplify tasks or improve efficiency can be an excellent strategy, helping leads to save time and streamline their activities. Long and Short Videos: For brands seeking to ramp up engagement, video content is essential. Consider incorporating various video marketing types as a way to enhance your content strategy, for example, explainer or tutorial videos, brand stories, product showcases, UGC videos, and case study videos. Podcasts and Webinars: These are powerful B2B content mediums for conveying information, showcasing expertise, and engaging your audience. They offer an excellent chance to gather valuable customer data through registration processes or interactive Q&A sessions.LinkedIn, X, and Facebook are the social media channels that deliver the most significant impact in B2B marketing.When is the best time to use video/stories or graphics/posts? Which works best for reaching your audience?“It depends on the platform,” says Julia. “Instagram is prioritizing video content, so I would try video here, and then repurpose the same video into infographics for other platforms, like X and LinkedIn where video content isn't as big.”Good options for using video content are when you want to show any type of behind-the-scenes content, showcase a product in real life or try to create that ‘brand talking to their bestie’ feeling. What’s the best approach to cross-posting?If you are lacking the bandwidth to create unique content for all new emerging channels, look at platforms that are similar in build (X and Threads, for example) and cross-post the top-performing content on the new platform. Communicating with Clients and StakeholdersHow can I explain the benefits of SEO when clients want to stop ads?When clients are thinking of stopping their advertising efforts, it's high time to underscore the enduring advantages and value of SEO. Here are four essential points to convey: Continuous traffic: Unlike paid advertisements, which cease to bring traffic once the campaign is over, SEO initiatives accumulate over time and ensure a steady influx of organic visitors. This benefit persists as long as the content stays relevant and authoritative. Greater cost efficiency: SEO demands an initial investment in content development and optimization, but avoids the recurring expenses of advertisements. In the long run, SEO often yields a superior return on investment, as organic visibility leads to lower acquisition costs. Enhanced trust and authority: Organic search results typically gain more trust from users than paid ads. Achieving a high rank in organic searches can significantly boost your brand's trustworthiness and authority within your sector. Improved user experience: SEO extends beyond mere keywords and linking: it emphasizes enhanced site usability and the overall user experience. This focus not only improves search rankings but also boosts engagement and conversion rates.How can you tell stakeholders about your brand’s social media performance if they have zero SM knowledge and tend to compare high numbers of likes with yours?“Always present numbers and, if possible, an explanation of how they tie into the company-wide goals,” recommends Julia Holmqvist. “Show graphs and images that are easily understandable. Stakeholders don't care about small KPIs or detailed analysis. They want to know what we did, how it performed, and how it helped the company.”Answering Your Questions About Inspiration What is your number 1 tip on making brand content more interesting when it’s not a ‘sexy’ topic or a B2B product—for example, infrastructure software? According to Julia, you should choose one pain point at a time and talk about it. Think about how your audience will experience this in the real world, and discuss it using conversational language. No one just wants to know how to attract leads to their new website. What they want to know is how to sell more. How do you balance social content that shows personality and maintains a professional/authoritative image? For example, how do you find a balance between co-opting trending memes and coming across as authentic to the brand personality? “There are two options here,” says Julia. “Brands can either pick one channel where they show more personality and ‘lifestyle’ content (such as Instagram), and then set the brand authority as a goal on LinkedIn. Or they can first build trust on a platform and then introduce more personable content. To maintain an authoritative image while still using memes, your brand has to be very established in the industry.” Answering Your Questions About Tools and AIWhat's the tool that allows you to copy in a URL and create a video based on the content on that page?Instant Video Creator. This tool automatically converts blogs into engaging videos in seconds.What is your favorite tool for an analysis of a social media account?Julia Holmqvist’s favorites are Semrush Social and Sprout Social.Semrush Social allows you to boost your brand’s social media visibility by managing all your profiles on the top social media platforms.Sprout Social is an all-in-one social media management solution.Any framework or tools for how to write AI prompts?Check out our article on 195 ChatGPT Prompts (& How to Write Your Own) on our blog.Bringing It All TogetherAs we wrapped up our webinar, the central takeaway was clear: authenticity and values-driven branding are crucial for success on social media in 2024.
