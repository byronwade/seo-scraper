  "content": "What Is the Helpful Content Update?The helpful content update is a significant change to Google’s algorithm that rewards high-quality, user-focused content in search results and demotes low-quality pages created primarily to rank well in search engines.Google launched the first helpful content update in August 2022. And has since refined it through several iterations. Next week, we will launch the “helpful content update” to better ensure people see more original, helpful content written by people, for people, rather than content made primarily for search engine traffic. Learn more & advice creators should consider: https://t.co/fgf2TPNIqD pic.twitter.com/xOuX2iVk2d— Google Search Central (@googlesearchc) August 18, 2022These updates introduced a sitewide ranking factor that evaluates the overall helpfulness of a website's content.Key features of the helpful content update include: Emphasizing expertise and depth of knowledge Promoting original, valuable, comprehensive information Insisting on a great page experience Following SEO best practices Penalizing search engine-first contentIn March 2024, Google finally integrated the helpful content update system into its core ranking algorithm. Today we released the August 2024 core update. It continues our work to improve the quality of our search results by showing more content that people find genuinely useful and less content that feels like it was made just to perform well on Search.https://t.co/T6Qt0JUoWt— Google Search Central (@googlesearchc) August 15, 2024This means the principles of helpful content are now applied continuously. Not through periodic updates. This integration emphasizes Google’s long-term commitment to prioritizing truly useful content for searchers. Further reading: Google Algorithm Updates Timeline [2024-2009]How Google’s Helpful Content Updates Affect SEOGoogle’s helpful content updates affect SEO because they changed how Google assesses and ranks pages and websites. These updates marked a before and after in SEO. And potentially reshaped the search engine results pages (SERPs) for many queries. Not only did old SEO tactics like keyword stuffing and content spinning stop working. They were identified and demoted. Content quality matters now more than ever. Here's how these updates impact search results: Surfacing people-first content: Pages that directly address user intent and provide comprehensive answers will likely rank higher Penalizing thin, AI-generated content: While AI is not banned outright, content must be high-quality, edited by humans, and provide unique value to rank well Emphasizing expertise: Google favors content created by people with first-hand experience or deep knowledge of the topic Effects are sitewide: If Google determines a lot of your content is unhelpful, your entire domain could see reduced visibility in search resultsHere’s an example:A fitness blog post about \"best exercises for beginners\" written by a certified trainer, with detailed instructions and safety tips, is likely to rank higher than a brief, generic list of exercises with no expert insights.To adapt to these updates, focus on creating content that truly helps your audience. Prioritize value. Ask yourself: “Would I find this information useful if I were searching for this topic?”If the answer is “yes,” then you’re on the right track. How to Identify Whether Your Site Was Affected by a Helpful Content UpdateGoogle's helpful content updates can shake up search rankings. When they hit, you'll feel it.You may notice significant and sudden drops in traffic, ranking, and overall visibility.And these changes typically align with Google's announcements. Image of Google Search Status DashboardFor example, Google rolled out a helpful content update in March 2024. If you saw major fluctuations, your site was probably affected.How can you be sure?Check your website’s performance.Here’s how:Analyze TrafficLook for sudden drops in performance using Google Search Console (GSC).Go to the “Performance” report and compare date ranges before and after a known update.A sharp decline in clicks, impressions, or average positions around the time of an update is a strong indicator you've been affected.TipRun any competitor’s site through Organic Research to see if they’ve also been affected by an update. Monitor Keyword PerformanceAs an SEO best practice, you should always be tracking your keyword rankings. This can help you evaluate performance over time. And it can be particularly useful to see if your site was affected by an update.Do this with the Position Tracking tool. Set up your campaign Add your target keywords Check the “Overview” tab regularly for significant changesYou can also set up triggers to get notified if your positions change by a significant amount. Why Might Your Site Have Been Hit?While no one can pinpoint exactly why a site gets hit (or doesn’t), these updates generally target unhelpful content. Here are three key factors that often play a role:Low-Quality ContentGoogle may demote your content if it: Lacks depth or original insights Summarizes other sources without adding value Doesn't thoroughly answer questionsGoogle wants to reward content that truly helps people. Not filler designed to rank.Over-Optimization You could be over-optimizing your content. Look out for these signs: Excessively repeating the primary keyword Using awkward phrasing to include specific search terms Creating pages solely based on keyword research, not user needsGoogle's algorithms have become sophisticated enough to detect signs that content prioritizes SEO tactics over user experience.Lack of ExpertiseSites that lack clear expertise or attempt to cover topics beyond their core competencies may be flagged as less helpful.Google wants to rank content that showcases topical expertise. It even uses the Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) framework to help its manual reviewers assess the quality of ranking content.To help on this point, make sure your content includes: Author credentials, background, and reputation Use of industry-specific terminology and entities Breadth, depth, and accuracy of topic coverage Consistency in subject matter across your siteHow to Recover from a Helpful Content UpdateThere’s no guarantee you’ll recover from a helpful content update.
