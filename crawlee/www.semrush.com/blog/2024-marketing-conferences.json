  "content": "Marketing events are back. Remember when they took a hit after every company was forced to go remote in 2020?By now the marketing conference scene hasn’t just recovered. It’s grown more than ever, estimated to reach $2.2 billion in value by 2028.Attending the right event feels like striking the perfect balance between your comfort zone and massive career development.You get to socialize and chat about the topics you work on every day and, at the same time, the brightest minds in your industry are in the same room as you.Whether you want to learn and discuss search engine optimization, social media marketing, AI, or paid ads, there are some events you can’t miss.Here are the top marketing conferences to attend in 2024. Why These Conferences MatterThere are two reasons why you should attend B2B marketing events.The first one is that virtual fatigue is real, regardless of your role. Most marketers spend their days sitting in front of a screen, analyzing data from SEO tools, writing new content, or scheduling posts in a social media calendar.Going to an event gives you a break to hang out with other peers face-to-face, which matters a lot regardless of your role: If you’re a solo marketer, you can make new friends, build business partnerships, land new clients, or open a door for a future role. If you’re a digital marketing manager, the networking opportunities can help you discover new talent and scale your team.The second reason is that events bring immense growth for your marketing career.Why? Because top-tier conferences are a goldmine of innovation and growth.You get to hear and talk to industry leaders shaping the future of online marketing, who have already overcome the same challenges you’re facing now.And those experts aren’t there just to deliver keynotes.In most cases, keynote speakers also grew thanks to building networks and connections, just like you can do at the event.See how Tim Sanders, a bestselling author and former Yahoo executive, puts it:“Your network is your net worth.”–Tim Sanders.Why Bother Going to In-Person Events?Attending a digital marketing conference implies spending money on tickets, flights, accommodation, lunch, and more.Can’t you just do the same in an online event, for less? The truth is that, as much as they can help you learn new tactics, you simply miss a lot of the networking experience if you don’t have in-person interactions.That’s why two-thirds of events and meetings have reverted to offline formats.Here’s what you get from in-person events: Marketing knowledge and tactics: At these events, you hear first-hand experiences from marketing leaders and creators, making it easy to return with fresh strategies to apply to your work Connections and partnerships: Most events focus on networking and connecting you with peers. This gives you the chance to meet other marketers for advice, insights, or feedback on your ideas Inspiration: Attendees are genuinely interested in the main topics of the event. You’ll get an immense push forward that motivates you to tackle career challenges or aim for a promotionHow We Chose the Top 10 ConferencesOf course, not every event is worth paying for.Here are the criteria we use to pick the most impactful marketing conferences for 2024: Quality of the speakers: These conferences have an impressive lineup of speakers with a track record of marketing success Networking opportunities: These events make networking easy, with a focus on roundtables, parties, or coffee and lunch breaks, instead of just keynotes Cutting-edge keynotes: Events should help you stay on top of marketing trends. These events cover the most innovative, up-to-date, and actionable topics Size: Conferences with thousands of attendees make it difficult to network. Smaller crowds make it easier to get the most out of the agenda and find valuable contacts1.

You find yourself surrounded by experts who have a track record of companies and projects. Having the initiative to talk and network with them (and any attendees) takes some courage.On top of that, there’s lots of information to absorb in each keynote. Some events in this list have hundreds of hours worth of talks.But don’t worry–we got your back! Here’s how to maximize your conference experience:Preparing for the conferenceGetting ready for the conference is key to getting the most out of it. First of all, look at the agenda and pick the sessions and workshops that are the most relevant to your role and current challenges.Does the agenda show speakers? If so, look them up on LinkedIn or Google to get a sense of what you might learn from them.Networking can feel intimidating, but you can start doing it even before the conference begins. That’s why connecting with speakers is a great way to break the ice and have some familiar faces to look out for.Here’s an example: if you’re attending Spotlight, you can connect with Sophie Miller with an invitation that explains how you’re excited to hear her keynote.This way, it’s easier to combine attending keynotes and connecting with peers who might help you propel your career forward.Once you’ve picked your favorite sessions to attend, try to align them with your company and career goals. What do you want to get out of them? How will they help you sharpen your skills, discover new strategies, or find valuable partnerships?The next step before the conference begins is building your schedule. Some conferences can be hectic, with hundreds of speakers. Try to prioritize the keynotes, workshops, and activities you don’t want to miss.Lastly, don’t forget to bring your essentials for learning and networking, like a notebook, your laptop, or some business cards.Learning and networking during the eventOnce you’re at the conference, it’s time to dive into conversations, social gatherings, and even informal coffee breaks.After attending the keynotes and talks you’ve shortlisted, make sure you introduce yourself and ask questions when meeting peers who were interested in the same topics.If you meet a marketer or keynote speaker who can be a valuable connection, make sure to follow up with a LinkedIn or Twitter message or a quick email to thank them for the chat. If possible, make the connection even more memorable by mentioning a specific topic you talked about. Showing genuine interest in them can lead to great conversations. What’s next after the conference ends?After the conference, your job is to revisit all the insights you’ve gained.Go through your notes, highlight the key takeaways, and propose new tactics that you want to apply to your role right away. Remember to reach out to your new contacts before too much time passes. A simple thank-you note can go a long way to keep the relationship alive.Most of these conferences are very active on LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social media. Stay engaged with the community by commenting on post-event discussions and joining forums (like the INBOUND one). This can open even more opportunities for career growth through learning and networking with experts.Budgeting and Convincing Your BossMarketing events can be quite expensive, and prices often range from $200 to $1500 for standard tickets. If you want VIP experiences, which might include private dinners or one-to-one consultations and workshops, then ticket prices can easily jump to over $2500.On top of this, don’t forget travel and accommodation (which can be costly depending on the event location), meals, transportation, and extras like post-event drinks.Attending a conference is an investment. In turn, to get your company and manager to sponsor your trip you need to justify its return on investment (ROI).Luckily, we’re here to help. Here’s how to create a proposal to convince your company: Write a detailed breakdown of all costs. Document the budget needed to attend the conference, including tickets, travel, accommodation, and any other expenses Highlight the benefits of attending. Explain how the event is related to your company’s business goals. This explains how attending will be good for you and for your manager too Connect keynotes with your current work. Point out the sessions, keynote speakers, and workshops that align with the projects you’re working on Find opportunities for your entire company. Highlight the speakers, sponsors, or attendees who could help your manager find new leads, meet partners, discover new talent, or scale your team Make a plan to come back with valuable insights. Offer to share your learnings with a presentation or report, so that the whole team benefits from your attendancePro Tip: Offer to minimize costs where possible. To do this, buy early-bird tickets, share your accommodation with other team members who attend, or pick budget-friendly travel options that make your proposal more appealing.Join the Right Event to Change Your Career TrajectoryBeing in the same room with the right marketing leaders can change your career forever.These events are the place to discover best practices that take your skillset to new heights, build connections that turn into business opportunities, or find inspiration that turns into marketing career growth.To make that happen, you need to pick the right conference, prepare ahead of it, and arrive with a “ready-to-network” mindset. Tie all the tactics and trends you’ve gained with your business goals and your entire team will understand the tangible value that B2B marketing events bring.Don’t miss out on these conferences–especially Spotlight by Semrush in Amsterdam, designed to help marketers illuminate the path from ideas to real-world impact!",
