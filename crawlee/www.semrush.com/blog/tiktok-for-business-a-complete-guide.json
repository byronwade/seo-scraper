  "content": "TikTok's growth has been nothing short of incredible. According to Guinness World Records, TikTok is officially the fastest platform to accumulate a billion active users. A third of adults use TikTok in the US alone, and around 62% of adults 30 or younger are on the platform—with older adults representing a fast-growing segment of users.In today’s digital landscape, businesses marketing to Gen Z or millennials can’t afford to skip out on TikTok’s potential. Even if your customer base skews older, TikTok's growing reach across age groups makes it a platform worth considering. But in light of the recent legal challenges and controversy surrounding TikTok, you might be wondering: Is investing in TikTok for business still a wise decision? In this comprehensive guide, we’ll dive deep into why TikTok is worth your time—and how to use TikTok for business to supercharge your ROI. Understanding TikTok’s Culture What TikTok Can Do For Your Business Developing a TikTok Marketing Strategy Creating Engaging Content Measuring Success: TikTok Analytics Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Understanding TikTok’s Culture Before we dive into using TikTok for business, let's take a quick tour of the current TikTok landscape—and how the platform has evolved. When TikTok first arrived in the US in 2018, it was primarily known for lighthearted content like music, dance, and lip-syncing videos. Today, it's a global powerhouse, home to a diverse range of short-form videos that inform, entertain, and inspire. The platform traces its roots back to Musical.ly, a social media app where users shared short clips of themselves lip-syncing to popular songs. While TikTok has expanded far beyond music-based content, Musical.ly's playful spirit continues to influence the platform's playful culture.Today’s TikTokers are highly engaged, spending an average of 90 minutes a day on the app. Music and sound remain central to TikTok's identity, playing a central role in who sees which content on their For You Page, and how likely they are to interact and engage with certain videos. As a result, many users discover new content, creators, and products through viral sounds and trending music. But TikTok has become so much more than just entertainment. In 2023, over a third of American adults turned to TikTok for news and information, according to Pew. The platform now hosts a wealth of short-form videos covering virtually every topic imaginable, from political commentary to dating advice.TikTok is even changing how people search for information. In fact, Adobe found that 49% of millennials and a staggering 64% of Gen Z use TikTok as a search engine, with one in ten Gen Z users preferring it toGoogle. Popular TikTok searches include: Lifestyle information (recipes, restaurant recommendations, DIY tips, fashion advice, etc.) Health and fitness tips Entertainment recommendations (music, books, TV shows, movies) Product reviews Travel inspirationTikTok also has its own unique social culture, with constantly evolving trends, memes, and slang terms. The term \"standing on business\", for example—which emphasizes authenticity, integrity, and focusing on one's goals in African American Vernacular English (AAVE)—has reached a global audience through TikTok. The more time you spend on TikTok, the more you'll notice these trends, phrases, and slang terms. In a nutshell, TikTok today is fertile ground for new businesses looking to engage and grow their audience. If your product or service appeals to young adults, you likely have a ready-made audience on TikTok—and with careful planning and a well-crafted strategy, you’ll reach them!💡Pro tip: When a TikTok trend aligns with your brand, don't hesitate to join in! Remember the gummy bear concert trend set to Adele's \"Someone Like You\"? Even Lindt got in on the action with their chocolate bunny version. What TikTok Can Do For Your Business Now that we've explored TikTok's cultural landscape, let's get down to business: how can TikTok actually fuel your company's growth?While major global brands have been leveraging TikTok for business for years, smaller and medium-sized businesses often hesitate to invest time and resources into emerging platforms. However, TikTok's impact on businesses of all sizes is undeniable.In 2023, TikTok partnered with Oxford Economics to measure the platform's impact on US businesses, including over 1,000 small businesses. The results were impressive: Expanded reach: Roughly two-thirds of small business managers surveyed reported reaching customers beyond their local area through TikTok. Business growth: More than half of TikTok users considered the platform valuable for expanding their business and customer base. Increased sales: 69% of small business managers experienced a boost in sales thanks to their TikTok presence.If you're in the ecommerce space, TikTok's Shopping and Showcase features offer even more opportunities. You can spotlight your products directly within your TikTok content, allowing customers to make purchases without ever leaving the app. But the benefits of TikTok extend beyond sales and reach, including boosted brand awareness, authentic engagement with your audience, and giving you a leg up on your competitors. TikTok is more than just a social media platform: it's a dynamic marketing tool that can transform your business. Whether you're a small business or a global brand, TikTok offers a unique opportunity to connect with your audience, drive sales, and build a thriving community.💡Pro tip: Lighthearted content can be a powerful tool for engagement and brand awareness. Duolingo's mascot-driven skits and slideshows are a hit with their audience, generating likes, shares, comments, and views. Developing a TikTok Marketing Strategy Creating a TikTok content marketing strategy follows the same principles as any successful social media marketing plan. It all begins with understanding your business goals. For example, Awareness: Do you want to reach new potential customers and establish brand recognition? Lead generation: Is your goal to use TikTok to identify and nurture leads? Sales: Do you want to sell products or services directly through TikTok? If so, are these impulse buys or do they require a longer sales cycle?Once you've defined your objectives, you can tailor your strategy accordingly. For instance, if your goal is to drive sales, consider offering exclusive deals for TikTok users, creating a dedicated landing page, or implementing other promotional tactics to support your sales efforts.Next, identify your ideal customer or target market. Start by asking yourself the following: Is a significant portion of my target audience active on TikTok? What questions or pain points can I address through my content?While TikTok is most popular among younger adults, it's essential to understand the specific demographics and behaviors of your target audience on the platform. This will allow you to create content that resonates with them, encourages engagement, and ultimately increases your visibility.Crafting Your Content StrategyThe most effective TikTok for business strategies leverage the platform's unique features and culture.

Engagement indicators: Monitor likes, comments, and shares to identify which types of content spark the most interaction.By closely monitoring these metrics, you'll gain valuable insights into what your audience finds most appealing. For example, if lighthearted videos featuring a company mascot consistently outperform other content, consider creating more of them. Look for opportunities to showcase your brand's unique personality and pay attention to how users respond. Don't forget to read the comments—your viewers might even tell you directly what they want to see!TikTok Analytics can also challenge your assumptions about your target audience. You might discover that your TikTok followers differ from your initial customer demographics. Embrace this new information and adapt your content strategy accordingly.Additionally, TikTok Analytics reveals when your audience is most active on the platform.
