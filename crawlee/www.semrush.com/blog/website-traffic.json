We’ll provide tips for improving traffic for your website, too.But first, let’s go over some basics.Understanding Website TrafficWebsite traffic is the number of people who visit and interact with your website typically over a set period of time, like per month or year.Measuring website traffic involves several key metrics. These tell you important things about how well a website performs and how people use it. Depending on the tool you use, these metrics may have different names, but some of the most common ones include: Visits/sessions: This shows the number of times visitors accessed a website within a set period of time. It gives you an overview of the overall traffic a website receives. So if one person visits a site 10 times, that counts as 10 sessions. Unique visitors: Unique visitors represent the number of distinct individuals who have visited a website over a given period. So, although a site may have 1,000 visits, only 600 of those might be unique. Page views: This lets you know the number of times a page on a website has been viewed by visitors. Use this metric to find out which pages on a website are most popular and identify underperforming content. Bounce rate: This is the percentage of people who visit a website and then leave before completing a specific action, like looking at more than one page. A high bounce rate isn’t always an issue, as it can simply show the visitor found what they were looking for, but it can sometimes indicate problems with the content quality or the user experience. Average session duration: This reveals visitors’ average time on a website during each session. If visitors find value in a website, they will likely stay on it longer. Traffic sources: This shows how visitors came to a website. Traffic sources may be categorized as organic (from search engine results), direct (e.g., typed the URL), referral traffic (links from other websites), social media, or via paid advertisements. Conversion rate: This is how many of a website’s visitors did what you wanted them to do (for example, buying something, filling out a form, or signing up for a newsletter). Exit pages: This tells you the last page visitors were on before they left a website. This can help you identify issues or areas for improvement to reduce visitor drop-offs. Device and location data: Knowing what devices and locations people use to access a website can help you make it work better on different devices and reach people in specific areas. Demographic data: Tells you more about the people who visit a website, such as their age, gender, interests, etc. This information helps ensure the content is relevant to the people you want to reach.These metrics can provide the insight you need to fix what needs to be fixed, improve the user experience, and get more people to use your website.Why Check Website Traffic?Checking web traffic is crucial for monitoring your website and competitors' websites.Here’s why:For your website, measuring website traffic helps you do three essential things: Understand how your website performs Reach your goals Understand the return on investment (ROI) of your marketing effortsFirst, understanding your website traffic will help you understand how well your website performs.
