That’s because there may be issues preventing the search engine from indexing your site’s pages.Here are two methods for checking if a search engine has indexed your website:Run an Online SearchUse this search query:site:yoursite.comThe search engine will return results from your site if it has indexed it:Otherwise, it will not show any results.This method also checks if a search engine has indexed a specific page.(Note: This method is fairly reliable as a starting point but not a perfect source of truth about webpage indexation.)Use Google Search ConsoleLog in to GSC and click “Pages” in the left sidebar. Then, click “View data about indexed pages.”Scroll down to the “Examples” section to see a list of your site’s pages in the Google index. The report can show up to 1,000 URLs.Alternatively, here’s how to check if Google has indexed a specific page:Type its URL into the “Inspect any URL in [your website]” search bar at the top of any GSC screen. Then, hit “Enter” or “return” on your keyboard.You’ll see the message “Page is indexed” if Google has indexed the page.Otherwise, you’ll see this message: “Page is not indexed: URL is unknown to Google.”TipClick “Request indexing” to submit the webpage to Google again. This is useful if you want Google to re-index it because you’ve updated its contents or fixed its indexing issue.How to Fix Indexing IssuesIf your site has indexing issues, some (or all) of its pages won’t appear in the search results.As a result, you’ll lose organic traffic.Indexing issues include: 404 errors: The web server cannot find a page at that URL The URL has a meta robots “noindex” tag: This tag tells search engines not to index the URL Duplicate content: Search engines may not index a page whose content is nearly identical to another page’sUse these tools to find and fix indexing issues:Google Search ConsoleGo to GSC and click “Pages” in the left sidebar to load the “Page indexing” report.Scroll down the report.

So a search engine submission service is likely unnecessary.Some webpage submission services claim they can get your site onto little-known search engines and directories like Ask.com and Yippy.But the vast majority of people use Google as their search engine. As of May 2024, its global market share was over 90.8%.So, as long as your site is on Google, you’re in good shape.Using a website submission service can also cause your SEO rankings to take a hit.Why?Because some of these services involve you paying other sites to link to yours—which results in unnatural linking behavior that Google doesn’t like. If Google catches you doing this, it may penalize your site.Some links you buy may also be toxic backlinks that hurt your rankings. Semrush’s Backlink Audit can help you find and disavow these links. But it’s easier to avoid buying potentially harmful links in the first place.So, stick with the search engines’ official website submission options.Submitting your site to Google and other search engines isn’t complex and doesn’t take long. As long as you follow the steps, your URLs should be indexed in no time at all.But if you encounter indexing issues after submitting your site, use Site Audit to troubleshoot and fix the problem.",
