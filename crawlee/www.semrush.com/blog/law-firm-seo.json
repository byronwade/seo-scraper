  "content": "What Is Law Firm SEO?Law firm search engine optimization (SEO) is working to improve a legal practice’s visibility in relevant search engine results—without paying for ads. Common tactics include publishing useful blog posts, improving site speed, and acquiring positive reviews on Google.With the right SEO marketing strategy, your law office can earn organic (unpaid) rankings like these:And ultimately get more clients.NoteLaw firm SEO is also known as lawyer SEO, attorney SEO, or law office SEO.Is SEO Important for Law Firms?SEO is important for most law firms and lawyers because it’s a cost-effective way to attract new clients.Every month, millions of people search for legal services and information through Google. On average, more than 45% of desktop searchers click an organic search result. And 27.6% click on something to enhance their search (like a search suggestion), 1.8% click an ad, and 25.6% click nothing at all.And the higher you rank in organic search results, the more exposure and clicks you’re likely to get:SEO is the tried-and-tested way to improve organic rankings.And while you need to invest in your legal SEO efforts, organic search can be far more cost-effective than other marketing channels.For example, law firm Morgan & Morgan gets around 630.6K organic visits from Google every month (in the U.S. on desktop). According to Semrush’s Organic Research tool.We don’t know their SEO budget. But it’s probably far less than the estimated $16.9 million it’d take to get this traffic through search advertising.7 Best SEO Tactics for Law FirmsWhen doing SEO for attorneys or law firms, certain tactics work better than others.Here are our top recommendations:1. Demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authority, and TrustworthinessGoogle wants to rank law firms that demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). Because it wants to give users reliable results.Especially since law is a Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) topic. Meaning poor-quality information and services can seriously harm people’s lives.Law firm Latham & Watkins demonstrates E-E-A-T through an “Achievements'' page. Which features case studies, awards, and accolades.The firm also provides detailed information about its attorneys.By showcasing photos, contact details, qualifications, and more, they make it clear that their lawyers are real and credible experts.In addition to demonstrating E-E-A-T on your website, try to build a positive reputation across the web.One of the best ways to do this is to build quality backlinks.2. Build Quality BacklinksBacklinks are links that point to your site from other sites. In addition to driving traffic and brand awareness, they can have a significant impact on your law firm’s Google rankings.You can learn the details in our backlinks guide, but know this as a general rule of thumb: The higher the quantity and quality of backlinks your site has, the more authoritative it’s perceived to be.Working to acquire backlinks is known as link building.To get started, make sure your legal practice is listed on reputable directories like: Best Law Firms Avvo FindLaw JustiaAnd then pursue your unlinked brand mentions.For example, if a client has named your firm in a blog post, ask if they’re willing to add a link.You could also try: Connectively: Respond to journalists’ requests for legal commentary Broken link building: Find broken links to competitors’ sites and convince webmasters to link to your site instead Skyscraper technique: Create a better version of highly linked content in your niche (e.g., legal guides) and convince influencers to link to your version insteadWhen you’re ready to elevate your efforts, use Semrush’s Link Building Tool.It identifies link building prospects (sites that might link to you) based on your target keywords and competitors. And gives each opportunity a rating out of five.You can then use the tool to send and track outreach emails (messages designed to convince prospects to give you a link).And monitor the backlinks you acquire.3. Perform Keyword ResearchKeyword research is the process of finding what your target audience searches for in Google. It’s one of the most important tasks when doing SEO for law firms. Because it helps you identify new ranking opportunities. And optimize your content more effectively.To get started, open Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. And enter a basic term related to your business (e.g., “divorce”).The tool will provide a list of search terms that include your starting term or a close variation.Along with the following metrics: Intent: The type of search intent, which is the general purpose behind the user’s search Volume: The keyword search volume, meaning the average number of monthly searches KD %: The keyword difficulty score, which measures how hard it is to rank highly for a given term SF: The number of non-standard results (SERP features) that appearVarious filters and sorting options make it easy to find the best keyword opportunities.For example, use the “Questions” filter to find legal queries you can answer through blog posts.Then, apply a keyword difficulty filter to focus on the least competitive terms.Click the check boxes and then “Add to keyword list” to save the terms you want to rank for.That way, you can view and organize them in Keyword Strategy Builder.4. Create Optimized ContentTo rank for your target keywords, you’ll need to create quality content that’s optimized for search engines and your target audience.The most important thing is aligning with search intent—what the user wants to achieve.For example, people who search “can you divorce without splitting assets” need reliable information about their legal options.That’s why the top-ranking results are high-quality, in-depth guides.Whereas someone searching “divorce lawyer in queens” is looking to hire a local attorney.So, the top results are about relevant services in that area.TipWhen analyzing keywords in Semrush, click the “View SERP” button or icon to view the Google results page.As we mentioned earlier, E-E-A-T is an important concept in law firm SEO (though not a direct ranking factor). So, give readers (and Google) good reason to trust your content.Generally, quality content is: Comprehensive Well-written Accurate and up to date Created by a topical expert Presented in a user-friendly wayAnd make sure to follow our on-page SEO checklist. To give your content the best possible chance of ranking highly.You can get help with Semrush’s SEO Content Template.Simply enter your target keyword(s), define your target audience, and click “Create content template.”Then, the tool will provide SEO recommendations based on the top-ranking pages.For example, you’ll get a suggested word count and readability score.When you’re ready to start writing, send your brief to the SEO Writing Assistant.Like this:The tool provides suggestions and scores to help you meet your targets.And Smart Writer tools that make the writing process easier.Further reading: Content Marketing for Law Firms5. Maintain Your Google Business ProfileIf your legal practice caters to local clients, it should have a well-maintained Google Business Profile (GBP).This can help you rank highly in the local pack (the map section that appears when people explicitly or implicitly search for products or services in their area).And in Google Maps:Your business profile may also appear in other contexts (e.g., when people search your brand name).So, it’s important that it makes a good impression. And provides all the information potential clients need.To get started, sign into GBP and enter your business name.If necessary, follow the steps to add or claim your business. And verify its location.Then, make sure your profile is complete and accurate.For example, Pardalis and Nohavicka Lawyers entered their opening date. Which enabled Google to display a “7+ years in business” attribute.They also provided photos, a list of legal services, accessibility information, and more.Once you’ve completed your profile, you can focus on: Keeping it updated, so clients always get the right information Responding to your Google reviews, to show that you care about client feedback Generating more reviews (e.g., by sending review request emails)These efforts can help you improve your local rankings and attract more clients. 6. Find and Fix Technical SEO IssuesTechnical SEO issues can harm your website’s rankings and user experience.Examples include: Broken links Links that point to invalid URLs frustrate users and make it harder for search engine crawlers to explore your site efficiently Slow page speeds Page speed metrics known as the Core Web Vitals can affect Google rankings. Because users want pages that load quickly. Duplicate content Identical or near-identical content wastes Google’s resources for crawling and indexing. And can weaken your SEO efforts. Missing title tags Failing to provide an HTML page title can make it harder for users and search engines to understand what your pages are about Robots.txt errors Issues with your robots.txt file make it difficult for search engines to understand which pages should be crawled (and which shouldn’t) You can check your site for over 140 issues with Semrush’s Site Audit tool.After setting it up based on the Site Audit configuration guide, head to the “Issues” report for a full breakdown.We recommend that you work on “Errors,” then “Warnings,” then “Notices.”Click “Why and how to fix it” for more advice on each issue. Then, click “Send to…” to send a task to your task manager (if you use one).In some cases, you might need to assign the task to a web developer or SEO specialist.You’ll often resolve technical issues via your website’s content management system (CMS).But you might need to use Google Search Console. It’s a free tool that lets you request Google indexing and handle other technical tasks.It can also help you monitor SEO results. As we’ll discuss in the next section.7. Monitor Your SEO ResultsMonitoring your SEO results allows you to see what’s working and what isn’t.
