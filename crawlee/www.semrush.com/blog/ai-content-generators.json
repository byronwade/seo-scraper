  "content": "For marketers and content creators, artificial intelligence (AI) is a huge money- and time-saver. AI has minimal overhead, and many AI platforms offer subscriptions for less than $100/month. AI can create a month's worth of content for your website, social media, and ad campaigns in a few hours. But that doesn’t automatically mean it’ll be good. To make AI content, you need to learn how to create good prompts and always employ human review & supervision. This is what differentiates the so-so writing tools from the all-stars. The best tools have good prompts and filters to help you create high value every time. What Makes the Best AI Content Generator?Developing AI content writing tools can cost millions. Many AI content generation tools use open source LLMs (language learning models) that are free for public use. An LLM is like a big language brain that powers generative AI software. So keep in mind, when you’re shopping around for a great tool, the secret sauce is in the software, not necessarily the brain behind it. What makes the best ai content generator? Look for an app or tool that lets you “teach” AI so it creates copy that meets your quality standards. See what other functions it offers, like keyword analysis, SEO improvements, or idea generators. Several tools have built-in filters, prompts, or analysis to help you improve the text. Look at cost. Many AI tools offer tiered paid plans, so find the plan that matches your monthly output. There are also plenty of free tools out there to try.Finding the best AI writers depends on the types of content you want to generate. One AI tool that works great for blog post outlines and planning might not work as well as another tool for landing page website copy.Now, let’s dive into some of these powerful AI writing tools. You’re sure to find one (or two) to help you create original content and lightning speed Tool Main Use Price AI Writing Assistant Generating copy for various content types in multiple languages Free 7-day trial, $25/month AI Social Content Generator Creating posts, memes, videos, carousels, etc. and publishing them on social media Free 7-day trial, $35/month Social Content AI Generating content ideas, posts, and images as well as scheduling social media posts tailored to your brand Free 7-day trial, $29.99/month Jasper.ai Generating marketing content with chat and workflows for emails, ads, social media posts 7-day free trial, $39/month for the Creator plan GrowthBar Generating SEO-focused content with blog outlines 14-day free trial, $36/month Scalenut Keyword planning, content generation, SEO scoring 7-day free trial, $39/month SERP Gap Analyzer Creating SEO-friendly content briefs and articles based on your specific SEO opportunities 7-day trial, $79/month AdCreative.ai Generating high-converting ads for Google Display and social media 3-day trial, $109/month Lately Repurposing long-form content into social media posts, scheduling 7-day free trial, $49/month; $199/month for up to 20 accounts ClickUp Project management with AI for writing marketing materials, SEO, and business operations Free Forever plan; base plan $5/month ContentShake AI Combining ChatGPT and Semrush for SEO-rich content 7-day free trial, $60/month SEO Writing Assistant Analyzing content for SEO, readability, originality, tone Available on Semrush platform, pricing varies 1. AI Writing AssistantAI Writing Assistant, created by Copymatic and available from the Semrush App Center, is robust. Its 76 tools help you generate copy for emails, blogs, CTAs, web content, social media posts, ads, video scripts, product descriptions, and even job descriptions. And it can do all that in more than 25 languages.To use the AI Article Generator, just input a headline, subheads, and target keywords. It then quickly puts together a full article in less than 15 seconds. It also provides an SEO score with suggestions for improvement.Not too shabby for 10 minutes of work. As with all first drafts, you may need to do a little editing work.But that’s OK. The AI Writing Assistant has functions to help you improve subheads, the title, or rewrite the article completely. PriceThis app can be your no-cost AI text generator with a free trial that lets you use the tool with no limits for seven days.For $25/month, you can keep producing unlimited content with AI. Pros Extensive list of free AI writing tools Available in multiple languages Fast and intuitive to use2. AI Social Content GeneratorAI Social Content Generator, available from the Semrush App Center, focuses purely on social content. You can create single-image posts, memes, videos, and carousels. To start, you’ll want to create your “brand page.” Upload your logo and set your tone of voice and font preferences to keep your posts consistent and on-brand. You can also save your social handles and website to be included in your AI-generated images. From there, the tool is pretty magical. You enter the basic theme of your post and it’ll quickly generate a first draft. If you don’t like what you see, give it a thumbs up or thumbs down to generate another option.You can also edit the text, media, or upload your own images. All of the options can be a bit overwhelming, but the customization is what makes the tool so versatile. You have templates to choose from for videos and carousels. The options are clean and modern, and they range from professional to more creative and fun.As an assistant, this is a great AI tool for social media marketing. The app doesn’t post to your social media accounts, but you’ll have ready-to-use content for any platform. You can also compare your posts to your competitors through the Competitor Analysis feature. See how they convert and when they post. Then build your social media strategy around the data.PriceA free 7-day plan is available, but you’ll need to enter credit card information.After the free plan expires, it’s $35/month to manage up to two brands and produce 200 posts per month. That should be more than enough for any small to midsize business, especially if you use the same content across your social media channels.Pros Produces a variety of posts, like text, memes, and carousels Incorporates your brand’s imaging Lots of customization optionsCons AI-generated content can be generic without edits Slight learning curve for non-designers3. Social Content AI Semrush’s AI-powered tool easily generates posts for major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, and Pinterest.After analyzing your website, the Social Content AI suggests hundreds of social media ideas and customizes each post to match your brand. You can easily generate copy, images, and design templates for any of the posts you want to create and directly schedule them too.These are the best content ideas I’ve ever seen generated. Social Content AI doesn’t just churn out the same overused ideas you’d see anywhere, it uses the description of your business (and even looks at your website if you provide it) to find custom content ideas to sort into topics for a full strategy.Lucas O’Keefe, Social Media ExpertSimply enter your website URL and a brief description of your business. Social Content AI will brainstorm hundreds of ideas, choose any ideas you like, and choose among options like tone, platform, and post type. Using eye-catching templates and AI, you will receive graphics that complement your company’s visual branding and custom caption copy. Make the best use of your time and resources since this tool performs a range of specialized functions that previously required an entire team, including a marketer, SMM manager, designer, writer, and analyst. Price Try it first with a free seven-day trial to see how much time it saves you. After the trial it costs $29.99/month.Pros No need for prompts: Content ideas and posts are created using your website and description to align with your brand. Supports 50+ languages for generating ideas and posts. Repurposing content: It’s easy to transform your existing website content into engaging social posts to drive traffic and boost visibility.Cons Only for social media (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Google Business Profile, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest), not for other content formats. No video generation yet, as the tool has launched recently and is expanding its functionality.4. Jasper.aiJasper (formerly Jarvis AI) is a popular AI content generator for good reason. You’ll start with a command, like “write” or “summarize,” add in some detail about the audience and purpose of the article, then watch it go to work. You can provide details about your brand’s voice to make sure the AI-generated content is consistent with your existing content. Essentially, you can teach it to write and sound like you. It also has a chat feature to help you brainstorm and research before creating content. The chat also helps you put together a customer avatar to help Jasper write content that appeals to them.What makes Jasper a true shining star is that it’s developed with marketers in mind. It includes features like campaign workflows for emails, ads, and social media posts.Each workflow—actually every feature—is user-friendly. There isn’t much of a learning curve, so you can jump right into content creation. Jasper will even generate art for your content, but it’s not very realistic. Its extension product, Jasper Everywhere, includes APIs and plugins to bring the writing tool to every part of your workflow. You can use AI while working in WordPress, Gmail, YouTube, Salesforce, and more.PriceThere is a 7-day free trial, but you have to enter credit card info to access it. Plans start at $39/month. Pros Built specifically for marketers and writers AI is responsive and collaborative, especially through the chat feature Easy to learnCons Expensive for casual users Doesn’t offer any analytics or optimization tools AI art generation is so-so5. GrowthBarGrowthBar started as an SEO Chrome extension and grew into a full-blown writing tool in just three years. Not too shabby.Like other AI writers, it offers a blog generator and workflows for content types: Email newsletters Press releases Product descriptions Sales emails Idea generatorBut its blog outline tool separates it from the pack. This function helps you build an outline by focusing on your keywords and headlines. Why is this approach impactful?The right keywords in the right places (title, headlines, and subheads) are what make it easy for web crawlers to find and rank your content. You can write your own headlines or borrow from some of the top ranking articles for your keyword. But since plagiarism is a big no-no for SEO, it’s best to use them as inspiration.With your headlines set, the tool will generate bullet points for each paragraph. You can edit each line before submitting the draft for AI to write. Remember, AI performs best when given a great prompt. The blog outline sets up a really good prompt for AI to use.Like Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant (more on this tool below), it scores the draft for SEO before you publish. Unlike the Writing Assistant, it doesn’t offer suggested improvements. GrowthBar’s flagship product, the Chrome Extension, allows you to take your SEO analyzer everywhere you work, such as WordPress or Google itself. From the Google Search page, you’ll see stats like keyword difficulty and domain authority for each result.You can also build your brand voice by uploading a description and content examples to teach AI how to write like you.PriceGrowthBar offers a generous 14-day free trial. You can generate two outlines and 15 AI paragraphs, which is defined as anytime you use an AI tool.To upgrade your usage, the base plan starts at $36/month. You can generate 25 outlines a month and 500 AI paragraphs—another generous plan.Pros Great SEO tool to boost your writing Blog Outline tool to nail your headlines Easy to useCons Heavily focused on SEO improvement instead of writing improvement A bit expensive without the deep functionality of similar tools6. ScalenutScalenut built its platform to personally escort you through the process of creating prompts for AI. They call it Cruise Mode.First, you’ll generate a keyword plan, which is a list of keyword clusters that you can use to create articles around. The report will even show you average searches so you can go after the heavy hitters. Then, you’ll generate a headline by giving a little context around your purpose and target audience.The next few steps are focused on the outline. Like GrowthBar, you’ll work on section headlines, then bullet points for each section. It takes about five minutes to generate an article. Then you’ll get a basic SEO score and can go through each paragraph to rephrase, rewrite, shorten, or lengthen the text. If you’re satisfied with the draft, you can export it to the editor where you can really start optimizing the article. It will even offer suggestions for improvements. Don’t overlook all the other short content types this tool can create. Scalenut has over 50 templates to help you produce everything from product descriptions to video scripts to your LinkedIn headline.PriceThe 7-day trial is easy to get you started, and you don’t need to enter credit card information to test the platform. You can create two SEO articles and have access to all the AI templates.At the end of the trial, the Essential plan starts at $19/month. The next tiers really open up your content creation with more articles, clusters, and access to integrations like one-click publish to WordPress.Pros Thoughtful Cruise Mode to prepare your article for AI Keyword clustering to build out a targeted content strategy Unique AI templatesCons Not as feature-rich as other AI writing tools7. SERP Gap AnalyzerSERP Gap Analyzer helps you create content for SEO plans.There are various ways to use the tool, like making content briefs, titles, descriptions, and articles with the help of AI.When you navigate to the “AI Writing Tools” tab of the app, you can choose which type of content you’d like to generate. The content brief can be especially helpful if you’re working with a writer to create SEO-friendly articles. The brief will automatically outline your content with useful sections for: Content overview Content focus Target audience Outline Key questions Resources Required keywordsThis brief can be taken to a writer or even fed to another AI content generator. Either way, it’ll make sure your content is structured well and focused on covering the topic completely.After you generate your content, everything will be saved to find later from each AI Writing Tool. One thing we like is the warning that comes when you generate an article:This reminds you that you should never publish an AI-generated article word for word to your website. Instead, take it as a solid first draft to then edit and improve with real examples, personal experience, and your own voice. PriceThe 7-day trial available from the Semrush App Center lets you test it out for a week. At the end of the trial, the base plan starts at $79/month. Pros Multiple tools in one Focused on an SEO-friendly content workflow Highly detailed content brief generationCons Mostly focused on SEO, not as flexible for other creative AI content generation purposes like creative writing or social media8. AdCreative.aiAdCreative.ai is focused on making ad creatives easier. With its own LLM that’s trained on high-converting ads, it creates optimized ads for Google Display and social media based on your brand.To start, you can sign up for a free trial in the Semrush App Center. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to get started. Enter your brand details to get set up. Then, you can choose the type of creatives you want to launch. Ad creatives, ecommerce product photos, and more. After you establish your brand, you pick the ads you want to generate and input some more information, such as your target audience. After creating your draft post, click “Generate” and the AI does the rest.You’ll get hundreds of variations of posts to choose from in order of the highest conversion rate score. Select the option(s) you want to download and all the formats and sizes needed. Not only does this app generate display ads, but it can also generate ad copy text and ecommerce product photoshoots. PriceThe 3-day trial available from the Semrush App Center lets you test it out before committing. Then, the base plan starts at $109/month. Pros Easy to use and speed of generating ads Focused on a specific use case (creating high-converting ads) Access to high quality stock imagesCons Limited free usage Assets are watermarked before downloading Extra costs for premium featuresAll plans include an unlimited number of AI generations plus unlimited free stock images to support your campaign. This allows you to create thousands of visuals in just a few minutes. Plus, AdCreative.ai was voted #1 overall Creative Automation Platform on G2 for Winter 2023, so you know the app is top-flight.9. LatelyLately is not the all-in-one service other tools offer, but it does this social media thing really, really well. To get started, link your social media accounts and tell Lately what platform will publish and schedule them for you. Lately can do it, but it also integrates with Hootsuite, HubSpot, and Sprinklr. You can prompt the tool for new content or provide existing content, like long-form blogs, videos, webinars, and white papers, to repurpose them into social posts. You can choose a past blog or even a video. Lately’s AI is trained to pick out which pieces will be best for social and engagement. Its AI will also gain an understanding of your tone. And it provides several social post options for each long-form piece of content you provide.Lately knows that AI’s first draft usually requires work. So the tool includes an AI Train-o-meter to train its AI and help you improve your post. For Instagram, the Train-o-meter will make sure you have hashtags, emojis, mentions, and an image.There’s an integration with Grammarly to save you from pesky typos. If you’re uploading video, Lately will pick out clips for social and even transcribe your videos. Once your post is ready, you can schedule it from the tool.Lately also offers a wealth of analytics and a management library, but it’s only available at the enterprise level. PriceThe standard 7-day free trial is available after you enter credit card information. It’s not a bad way to test the tool, especially if you already have long-form content ready to convert. You aren’t limited by the number of posts you can create, only by the number of social accounts. The paid packages are pricey. The Starter plan is $49/month if billed annually, and you can link one user seat and five social channels. The next tier is the Professional plan at $159/month for up to 3 user seats and 15 channels, which is a big jump.The Enterprise plan offers custom solutions and integrations for your organization, but you’ll need to contact Lately for pricing.Pros Impressive AI tool for social media Maximize existing content for better distribution Flexible scheduling optionsCons Expensive starter plan Doesn’t generate social media posts without content you’ve submitted Not ideal for individual usage10. ClickUpClickUp, primarily a project management tool, recently added ClickUp AI to its feature list. It’s a simplified application of AI. You can ask it to write basic marketing materials, like blogs, emails, and social media posts. There are also prompts for designers, engineers, and HR.The tool will ask for a little background information, and AI will do its thing. While these other departments may not have flashy and exciting copy, it’s a practical and creative use of AI.As for the writing tool itself, it’s OK. The AI is responsive. It has built-in tone options or you can build your own. It doesn’t have an editing mode for any of the AI-generated text. If you want a rewrite, you need to tell the tool to do it instead of making the changes yourself. There is a keyword cluster feature to help you build your content strategy, but the data and insights are pretty sparse. The best benefit of the ClickUp AI is its place within the ClickUp Dashboard. The documents AI writes can be saved within specific project folders to provide requirements, design personas, and FAQs for team members. PriceClickUp has a Free Forever plan that’s feature-filled and functional. If you’re using the platform for yourself, you won’t feel like you’re missing out. The Unlimited plan starts at $7/month and provides more storage and team functionality, like Google Single Sign-On and Whiteboards, as you upgrade. The ClickUp AI writing tool is available in every plan. Pros Simple interface and functionality Unique AI prompts that cover business operations needs Free Forever plan and low monthly plansCons Can’t directly edit the AI-generated text Weak SEO features AI outputs are too generic11.

SEO Writing AssistantSEO Writing Assistant, available on the Semrush platform, is the heavyweight of all of Semrush’s writing tools for both price and functionality.Let’s look at a few of the things this app can do.

You’ll need a Semrush subscription to use SEO Writing Assistant.

You can request a 7-day free trial before committing to the monthly subscription.Pros The most robust writing assistant in Semrush’s toolkit AI writes and analyzes text for search optimization Easy plugins for Google docs and WordPressCons More expensive than other tools listed Not ideal for businesses that aren’t regularly creating contentUse AI To Fuel Your Content CreationThis is just a sampling of available AI writing tools.
