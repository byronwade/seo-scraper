  "content": "What Is an SEO Score? An SEO score is a metric that shows a website’s overall technical SEO health. And indicates how well it may perform in organic search engine rankings. The exact meaning of the metric may differ between various SEO tools.For example, Semrush's Site Health is an SEO scoring metric. And it’s shown here in the Site Audit tool. A high Site Health score means your site is well-optimized for search engines and people. The more technical issues and problems you have within your site, the lower your SEO score will be.How to Check Your SEO ScoreTo check your website's SEO score, run a technical SEO audit with Semrush's Site Audit tool. Here's what you need to do:Open the tool and create your first project by entering the domain and project name.Next, configure your project (follow the steps in this article if you need help). And note that you can crawl up to 100 pages with a free Semrush account.Then, click the “Start Site Audit” button. And the tool will crawl your site similar to the way Google does to analyze any potential technical SEO issues.Once the crawl is complete, Site Audit provides a detailed overview of your site's health.It’ll look like this:The “Site Health” section gives you two important pieces of information: Your Site Health score: Based on the number and variety of errors and warnings found on your site The average score among top performers: Based on the top 10% of the websites in your industryNow, let's take a look at what affects your site’s SEO score and how to improve it.How to Improve Your SEO Score You need to address technical and on-page issues to improve your SEO score.See your site's issues by clicking the “Issues” tab in the Site Audit tool. The problems shown here are ranked by severity: Errors: High-severity issues Warnings: Medium-severity issues Notices: Not necessarily issues (But it's good to go through them and see what you can improve)Each line will include a link to a list of URLs affected by that particular issue. Plus an explanation of the issue and tips on how to tackle it when you click on “Why and how to fix it.”Like this:Now, let’s go over some of the main ways you can improve your score that you’re likely to see in the tool: Make Sure Google Can Crawl and Index Your WebsiteSearch engines have to be able to crawl (find pages) and index (store those pages in a database) your website for it to rank. So your score is influenced by how well search engine bots can do those things.Googlebot follows a three-step process: It discovers a webpage through a link on other webpage (on your site or another site) It analyzes all of the content on the page (copy, text, images, videos, etc.) and stores the page in Google’s index—so long as there are no issues that prevent indexing If can serves your page to users in search engine results when relevant to users' search queriesSome issues make it harder for Google to complete this process. And problems can occur at any stage.If your website has issues related to crawling or indexing, your score will be negatively impacted.Here are a few ways to ensure your site is easy to crawl and index:Further reading: Crawlability & Indexability: What They Are & How They Affect SEOImplement a Solid Website StructureYour site’s architecture influences how easy it is for both humans and search engines to navigate it. A solid site architecture can also help Googlebot find your most important pages. And understand how your pages are related. Site architecture includes things like: URL structure: How the various parts of webpage URLs (e.g. top-level domain, subdomain, path, parameters, etc.) are organized Internal links: Links to your pages from other pages of your website, and the anchor text (the clickable, linked tet) of those links Navigation: Clicking through your website to find various pages or resources. Which is primarily influenced by your website’s navigation menu.A disorganized website architecture may lower your SEO score. And might look something like this:But a good website architecture will: Organize pages logically. The most important pages should be at the top of your website hierarchy (i.e., linked from your homepage). Link pages that are topically relevant. And with anchor text that communicates the content of the destination page. Limit crawl depth. No pages are more than three to four clicks from the homepage to help both Google and users find themOne good way of organizing your website is with a flat architecture. Which looks like this:Site architecture becomes more important (and more influential for your SEO score) as you publish more pages. Submit Your Sitemap to GoogleAn XML sitemap is a file that tells Googlebot which pages on your website to crawl and index. To help Google crawl your website more efficiently. Some content management systems like WordPress and Shopify will automatically generate sitemaps. If your website has one, it will likely be located at “yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml.” If not, you can use a sitemap generator tool to create one. And then add it to your root directory.Then, submit your sitemap to Google in your Google Search Console account. Click “Sitemaps” under “Indexing.”Enter your sitemap URL, then click “Submit.”Look for the message “Success” under the status column to confirm your sitemap was successfully submitted.Improve Your Internal LinkingInternal links send Googlebot around your website to find your pages. So, resolving linking issues and optimizing links can make your website easier to crawl. We recommend that you do the following: Repair broken links (i.e., links that don’t work or lead to dead pages) Add links to orphan pages (i.e., pages that aren’t linked to from any other page on the site)) Use descriptive anchor text Avoid using the rel=\"nofollow\" attribute (which tells Googlebot not to follow a link)Fix Duplicate ContentDuplicate content occurs when the same content (or highly similar content) appears on more than one web page. It confuses Google about which version to rank—and could lead to lower or no rankings.You have two options for resolving duplicate content. Delete the unnecessary pages (after adding any needed content to the main one) and use a 301 redirect to point search engines to the version you want to prioritize Add canonical tags to all duplicates to help Googlebot understand which version of the page you want to be indexed (you should do this when duplicates are necessary)Prioritize Website SecurityRunning your website with hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a must for SEO. It’s a confirmed ranking factor because Google only wants to send users to secure websites.HTTPS pages are displayed like this in a web browser:To serve your pages on HTTPS, you need an up-to-date security certificate—a digital file issued by a third party that confirms your website’s identity and data encryption.Further reading: HTTP vs. HTTPS: Differences, Benefits, and Migration Tips Offer a Good User ExperienceYour site needs to provide a good user experience by having pages that load fast, that don’t shift unexpectedly, etc. Because Google prefers to rank webpages that provide a great page experience (which they’ve confirmed is a ranking factor). And Googlebot prioritizes indexing the mobile versions of pages. So your website needs to be optimized for mobile.In Site Audit, your SEO score is influenced by two sets of usability metrics: Core Web Vitals: Google’s metrics that measure real-world user experience for load times, interactivity, and visual stability. Google uses the Core Web Vitals to evaluate a page’s overall experience Site performance: Speed-related factors. Like those related to webpage size, JavaScript, CSS, and other HTML elements.Improving usability often requires working on the backend of your website. Which may require the assistance of a web developer. But it’s essential for providing a high-quality page experience.Further reading: The Complete Guide to Mobile SEO—8 Tips & Best PracticesImprove Page Load SpeedTo improve your website’s Site Performance score, follow these steps.Compress ImagesImage compression is the process of reducing your images’ file sizes. So your website loads faster.To compress an image, you can: Resize your image using a photo editing tool Use an image compressor tool Add an image optimizer pluginMinify JavaScript and CSS FilesJavaScript and CSS files can make your website more visually engaging and interactive. But these files can often slow down load times.Compressing them can maintain their functionality while improving speed.You can do this manually, but it’s best to use minifying tools.Use a CDNA content delivery network (CDN) is a group of servers that serves content to users based on location. So, using a CDN can improve load times across your website.Some of the most popular CDN providers are: Cloudflare Amazon CloudFront Google Cloud CDN Microsoft AzureCDN providers offer various pricing plans, like a flat monthly fee or usage-based pricing. The best option for your website will depend on your use and performance needs.Step Up Your On-Page EffortsOn-page SEO involves making improvements to your pages to help them rank better.You can optimize these on-page elements directly in your CMS or by using a plugin to boost your SEO score.Write Good Title TagsA title tag is an HTML element that indicates a page’s title. And Google often displays the title tag as the blue, clickable hyperlink in search results.Each of your pages should have a unique, concise title tag that includes your target keyword and is fewer than 60 characters. It should also entice users to click on your content.Optimize Your Meta DescriptionsA meta description is HTML that provides a short summary of your webpage content. And Google will often display the meta description beneath the title shown in search results. Each page should have a unique and relevant meta description that’s 105 characters or fewer. You can also add enticing offers or information to make your result more click-worthy.Craft Helpful URLsA URL is the web address for an individual page. Which communicates to users and search engines where to find a page, what it's about, and how your website is organized.Your URLs should: Use the HTTPS protocol Use logical subfolders Have concise and descriptive URL slugsUse Alt TextAlt text provides a description of an image for the visually impaired and to search engine crawlers. To make your website more accessible and help your images rank in search results.But not all of your images need alt text. Only those that provide additional meaning or context about a topic.When writing alt text, make sure you’re descriptive and concise. And include your target keywords (or variations) when appropriate.Implement Structured DataStructured data (also called schema markup) is a standardized data vocabulary that helps search engines better understand your site’s content. And if a webpage includes schema markup, Google can extract the data and display it as a rich snippet.Rich snippets are non-standard results that stand out in search.For example, this webpage uses product schema to display key information about their product. Like an image, price, and star rating.Google supports rich results for 35 schema markup types. Some of the most common include: Product Event FAQ Local business Organization Recipe SitelinksIf you have content that qualifies for rich snippets, add the appropriate schema markup. Because it can lead to: Improved click-through rate (CTR) Better meeting the user’s search intent (the reason behind the query) Better optimization for voice searchTo add a schema, use Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper. How to Measure Your SEO Score ProgressAfter you fix issues and take steps to optimize your website, rerun Site Audit to see your new results.
