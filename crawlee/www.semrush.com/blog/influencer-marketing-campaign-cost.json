What Types of Collaborations Are Available?There are a great many marketing campaigns that businesses can develop by teaming up with an influencer. It’s important to remember that different types of collaborations are suitable for different budgets, and costs can vary depending on the industry. For example, within the tourism industry it is common to offer accommodation, spa visits or other travel experiences in return for promotion by an influencer, which keeps costs down. Howere, in the fashion industry, brands pay for exclusivity as they don’t want to work with an influencer who promotes the new Gucci bag one week, and then the new Prada bag the following week. So, the cost of partnering with an influencer can be considerably higher for luxury fashion brands. Very often influencers will offer post “bundles” where they charge less overall for a longer-lasting collaboration. Influencer Analytics and other platforms can help broker these deals and help you get the most bang for your buck.Here’s a look at some of the most popular options and some explanation on pricing. Influencer tactic Description Pricing considerations Guest posting Guest posting is where influencers create and publish blog posts on a brand's website or blog. The influencer creates a post on a topic related to the company’s industry and includes links to the website. At the same time, the brand gains high-quality content and boosts its visibility among a new audience. Bear in mind that you’ll have to pay both the influencer and website in this type of campaign. Influencer writing costs start from approximately $400. Website publishing from $60–$15,000, depending on audience size and domain authority. Sponsored content Sponsored content involves brands paying influencers to promote their products or services on social media platforms or other channels. Influencers create text posts, videos, or stories, including a tag that discloses the content is sponsored. Sponsored content can include product reviews, unboxing videos, tutorials, and others. Costs range from $10 to more than $4000, depending on the audience size and content type. Co-creation The brand and the influencer work together to develop ideas and create content. Co-creation can take many forms, including product launches, limited edition collections, and exclusive content. The aim is to create a unique experience for the influencer’s audience, while also growing awareness and driving sales for the brand. Costs vary vastly, depending on the type and volume of content required as well as audience size. Competitions Influencer competitions, contests or giveaways see influencers collaborate with companies to promote the brand’s products or services. The influencer creates content which contains information about potential prizes, entry requirements, and deadlines, which might require entrants to follow the brand, influencer or both, as well as tag friends in comments. A single post can range from $25 to over $1000. Costs will depend on how much the influencer is involved. Generally, longer term engagements can be negotiated, so the cost per post is more economical. Mentions Influencer mentions are one of the most straightforward influencer marketing campaigns available. The influencer “mentions” the brand in a comment and charges for it. When done well, this can drive traffic to the brand’s website, increase sales, and build a loyal following of customers. Cost from $25, depending on audience size. Discount codes Influencer discount codes help push audiences towards becoming customers! Your company can provide an influencer with a unique discount code to share with their followers, which is promoted by posts on social media. Cost from $25, depending on audience size. How to Estimate Your Campaign CostNow you know what options you have, you need to work out how much your influencer marketing campaign is going to cost. Platforms like Influencer Analytics serve as a one-stop shop for running influencer marketing campaigns. They can help your business work out how much certain influencers and campaigns will cost. Here’s a quick guide to using the platform. In the following use case, we’ll imagine we are a small, UK-based gaming company with a limited budget: Starting with the influencer discovery tab, choose the channel you are interested in. There are more than 27 million influencers to choose from! The gaming company already has a good presence on Twitch, so they want to expand into YouTube marketing. Use the filters to elect your industry, number of views, subscribers, language and country. In the example below we are showing the plan, in the gaming niche. You’ll be presented with a huge list of relevant influencers, filtered as you like. You can click on any to expand their details. Below we have two examples: A mega influencer and a micro influencer. You’ll see their stats and how much it will cost, on average, to engage their services. With an integration cost of over $250,000 the first influencer is out of budget. A further look reveals Deep Silver, a UK-based influencer with a more manageable price range. You can also see how well each influencer does in terms of channel quality. This will help you determine whether it is worth spending your budget on any particular influencer. Below, you can see an example of a poor quality influencer and one that is categorized as Good. It’s important to bear in mind that audience size is not the most important metric. Number of likes, engagements and comments are better indicators of a successful campaign. It’s also worth noting that influencer fees don’t always tally with the channel quality rating. So make sure you pay attention to these metrics. Once the gaming company has established that an influencer has good potential, they can add them to a shortlist. You can do this with the integrated list building tool, and then choose the most relevant and cost-effective influencers for your brand.Later, you’ll be able to create and manage your influencer campaigns and even invite colleagues and clients to stay up to date. The platform also offers data-driven performance forecasts and automated reports.Final ThoughtsWhen you first start working with influencers, you’ll need to know how much it’s going to cost and whether or not it’s going to be effective. Then, there’s the time associated with reaching out to influencers, the negotiations, and business-influencer relationships. With a platform like Influencer Analytics, you can far more easily manage campaigns, communication and even forecast costs and report on your successes.",
