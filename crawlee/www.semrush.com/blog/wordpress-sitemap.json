It looks something like this:Starting with version 5.5, WordPress automatically generates a basic sitemap for your website. You just have to add \"/wp-sitemap.xml\" to the end of your website's address. Like this:https://www.yourdomain.com/wp-sitemap.xmlThe WordPress sitemap URL also updates whenever you publish or update a page.However, the default XML sitemap only has basic functionality.
