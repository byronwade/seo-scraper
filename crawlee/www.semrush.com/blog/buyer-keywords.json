  "content": "What Are Buyer Intent Keywords?Buyer intent keywords are search terms that indicate a user’s readiness to make a purchase. These terms indicate a higher likelihood that the searcher is preparing to make a transaction—as opposed to merely seeking information.And these keywords are valuable to marketers because they signal a user is further along in the buying cycle. And closer to a purchase. Buyer intent keywords can be classified as: Low intent (also called commercial intent) High intent (also called transactional intent)TipYou can quickly find whether a keyword has buyer intent (meaning it’s commercial or transactional) by plugging it into Keyword Overview. And checking the “Intent” widget. Like this:Low-Intent KeywordsLow-intent (or commercial intent) keywords are search terms used by folks in the middle of their buying journeys. Those people are usually considering making a purchase and are looking for options. Or evaluating products or services. These often include words like “review,” “best,” or “top.”Despite not indicating an immediate purchase, low-intent keywords play a vital role in the buying journey.Why?Because they’re essential for attracting potential customers in the consideration stages of the buying process.High-Intent KeywordsHigh-intent (or transactional intent) keywords are search terms potential customers use when they’re strongly inclined to make a purchase.These keywords tend to be specific and direct—making them valuable if you’re looking to convert searches into sales. Especially for pay-per-click (PPC) search ads—advertisements served to users based on what they search for and some additional targeting. High-intent keywords often include phrases like “buy,” “deal,” “discount,” or “coupon.” Or include the brand or product name.By targeting these keywords, you can increase your conversion rate, return on ad spend, and revenue. However:High-intent keywords also tend to be more competitive (and expensive for paid ads) than low-intent keywords. Further reading: What Is Search Intent? A Complete GuideWhy Buyer Intent Keywords Are ImportantHere are some of the most important reasons why buyer intent keywords are so important:Drive More ConversionsLeveraging buyer intent keywords can help you boost conversions by bringing in highly targeted traffic.Because people who search buyer keywords are frequently in the decision stage of the buyer’s journey. And these people already know what they want and need. They just need a little nudge to make the purchase.Which means:If you optimize your landing pages and product pages for buyer intent keywords, you can match your offer to their exact needs and wants. And convince them to buy from you.For example, someone who searches for “best wireless headphones” is clearly interested in buying wireless headphones. The search results make this clear:But they might not be sure which brand or model to choose.That’s where your content comes in. You can create a helpful guide that compares different wireless headphones and recommend the best one for different scenarios.Improve CredibilityUsing buyer intent keywords can also help boost your credibility and authority in your niche. By creating high-quality content answering your potential customers’ questions and concerns, you can show them you know what you’re talking about. And that you have a solution that works.You can also use social proof, testimonials, case studies, and other trust signals to back up your claims. And show how you’ve helped others achieve their goals.For example:If you sell software that helps people create online courses, you can target low-intent keywords like “best online course platforms” or “online course platform comparison.” Provide useful information and guidance. And you’ll position yourself as a trusted source and a reliable solution provider. Like this:Increase Search VisibilityCreating content that incorporates buyer intent keywords can also increase organic (unpaid) traffic and your overall visibility.
