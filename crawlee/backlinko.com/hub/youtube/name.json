  "content": "YouTube Channel NameWritten by Brian DeanLast updated Oct. 02, 2024What Is a Channel Name? Your channel name is the official name of your channel on YouTube. It serves as your channel’s identity and is displayed on videos, the channel page, and in search results. Choosing a strong channel name is crucial for branding, discoverability, and overall channel success. There are several different types of Channel Names, including a person’s first and last name (Casey Neistat) and names that describe a channel’s overall topic (5-Minute Crafts). Why Is Your Channel Name Important? Your Channel Name appears on your videos, your channel page, and in YouTube’s search results. Also, your channel name is a big part of how people will define and understand what your channel is about. So it’s important that your name accurately represents your brand. Best Practices Choose a Channel Name Category The first step is to decide on the Channel Name category you’re going to go with. In general, Channel Names fall into 4 main categories: Name (Taylor Swift) Brand (Nike) Category (Classic Game Room) Descriptive (Epic Rap Battles) Using your first and last name as your Channel Name the easiest and most straightforward approach. And it works particularly well if you plan on being the ‘face’ of your channel. For example, Marie Forleo is an entrepreneur with a strong personal brand. So when she created her YouTube Channel, she simply named it: Marie Forleo. However, using your name as your Channel Name may not be a good fit for you. If that’s the case, make sure to review these best practices to help you choose a great Channel Name. Your Name Should Describe Your Topic Ideally, someone could see your Channel Name and instantly understand what type of videos you put out. That said, you don’t need to literally describe your channel’s topic. That can lead to a flat, generic-sounding Channel Name (like: Videos For Weight Lifters). Instead, think of a creative way you can highlight (or even hint at) your channel’s topic. For example, let’s look at the Video Influencers channel. Video Influencers describes this channel’s topic (growing your brand through video)… without sounding boring or generic. Your Name Should be Unique It’s important that your name stands out from other channels on YouTube. For example, The Action Lab is a growing science channel. Let’s say you wanted to name your channel Action Laboratory. That name could be easily confused with The Action Lab. So before deciding on a name, pop your potential name into YouTube and see what comes up. If you see another channel (or channels) that have a Channel Name that’s very similar to yours, you should probably go with something else. However, if you can’t find any similar-sounding channels, you’re good to go. Also, make sure to search for your potential name in Google as well. This helps you avoid a Channel Name that’s similar to another brand (even one that’s not active on YouTube). For example, Screen Junkies is a movie-focused channel with over 6.7 million subscribers. This unique Channel Name ensures that it won’t be confused with any other movie-related brand on or off YouTube. Your Name Should be “Sticky” You want your Channel Name to be something that people can easily remember. So the more unique your name, the more it will stick in people’s minds. For example, MrBeast is one of the most popular content creators and his main and the most popular channel has over 310M subscribers. NOT ANOTHER COOKING SHOW gives you an idea of what this cooking channel is about… and it’s very memorable. Another example of an extremely sticky name is Crazy Russian Hacker (12 million subscribers). Not only are Taras’s videos extremely well done, but his hilarious channel name is one that’s hard to forget. Naming Tips and Checklist Here are some quick tips and strategies to help you decide on your Channel Name. Keep it short and sweet: Aim for a channel name that is no more than 20 characters long. This will make it easier for viewers to remember and type in. Make it memorable: Choose a channel name that is unique and easy to stand out from the crowd. Avoid using generic or overused names. Use relevant keywords: Incorporate keywords that accurately reflect the content of your channel. This will help potential viewers find your channel when searching for relevant topics. Keep it brand-safe: Avoid using offensive or controversial language in your channel name. You want to create a channel that is welcoming and inclusive to all viewers. Check for availability: Before you settle on a channel name, make sure it is available on YouTube, other social media platforms, and a website domain name. Get feedback: Ask friends, family, and colleagues for their feedback on your channel name. This can help you identify any potential issues before you launch your channel. Make it easy to pronounce: Choose a channel name that is easy for people to say and spell. This will help avoid confusion and ensure that viewers can find your channel. Keep it consistent: Use the same channel name across all of your social media platforms. This will create a cohesive brand identity and make it easier for viewers to find you. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: If your target audience is global, be mindful of cultural sensitivities when choosing a channel name. Avoid using names that may be offensive or misunderstood in certain cultures. Keep it evergreen: Avoid using trends or references that may become outdated quickly. Choose a channel name that will have lasting appeal. If you’re stuck, I recommend checking out the Hootsuite YouTube Name Generator.
