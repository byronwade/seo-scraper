Download the full list here: A deeper dive at the top 5 ecommerce companies in the world The top 15 sneak peek might have curbed curiosity temporarily, but if you‚Äôre anything like us, we want to know ‚Äúwhy‚Äù these companies are on top. Similarweb Sales Intelligence tells us exactly that. Let‚Äôs see it in action with a deep dive into the top 5 ecommerce companies: 1) Amazon.com No shock on this one, amazon.com is in first place. What is surprising is that amazon.com‚Äôs year-over-year visits are down 3.51%, while their month-over-month (MoM) visits are up 4.38%. Even with some fluctuation, the total visits landed at 2.3B ‚Äî not bad, if we can say so. Even with some fluctuation, amazon.com maintains a solid brand presence and effective SEO strategy; its largest traffic source was direct, with 1.2B visits, followed by organic search, with 585.9M visits. Although we see a bit of a dip in January and February, we also see a steady increase in March, April, and May ‚Äì which can be attributed to holidays like St. Patrick‚Äôs Day, Easter, and Passover, to name a few. As shoppers head to Amazon for their typical online shopping, we see an uptick of 86% on desktop and 51% on mobile when it comes to Visit Duration. Most likely, shoppers are spending more time browsing for related items because of the Memorial Day discounts. Who doesn‚Äôt love a good deal? As mentioned, direct and organic search led the charge in driving traffic to amazon.com. So, what was the world looking for that led them to amazon.com? Short answer: everything. Longer answer: these are the 15 most popular organic keywords for May‚Ä¶ Amazon Prime, which takes place in July, and Amazon Kindle-related search terms made up 53% of the top 15. Also in the top 15 is the Amazon-exclusive movie, The Idea of You, and the Amazon-owned ad-supported video-on-demand streaming service, Freevee, indicating a few things: Although Amazon originally started as an online book retailer, it has vastly expanded its offering into a general retailer. Then, it moved forward by offering E-Readers (Kindles), cloud services, and now home entertainment (Freevee, Prime Video, and The Idea of You). With this move, they have come to own the online retail business and continue expanding. What website technologies does the biggest ecommerce company use? Well, here are a few: Audio Video Media: Art19 (installed February 2024), a tool that provides near real-time RSS ad insertion, unlocking regional and international advertising as well as monetization of back catalogs Conversion & Analytics: Adobe Analytics (installed January 2024), provides reporting, visualizations, and analysis of Customer Data that allows customers to discover actionable insights Advertising: Demdex (installed January 2024), actionable and optimized audience targeting 2) Samsung.com The number two spot goes to samsung.com, who‚Äôs traffic has also seen some ups and downs. Compared to May 2023, it saw a decrease of 4.97%, but when compared to April, there‚Äôs been an increase of 3.06%. It‚Äôs interesting to see that a massive chunk of the traffic comes from mobile devices (96%), indicating that people are looking for phones on their phones, resulting in high direct and organic search traffic. When it comes to samsung.com‚Äôs online channel overview, its biggest driver is organic traffic, with 419.8M, while its direct traffic is 387.7M, followed by its paid search traffic, with 273.2M visits. These are the top 15 non-branded keywords that users were looking for when trying to discover or purchase Samsung products. Our organic search analysis debunks the hypothesis that traffic is primarily mobile due to users searching for accounts or apps related to their device. So, why is the channel traffic for samsung.com skewing so heavily towards mobile? A few possible reasons: A recent analysis of smartphone usage revealed that ‚Äú48% of buyers use their smartphones to start searching about the product or service they are interested in.‚Äù However, another study found that desktop users had a conversion rate of 4.14% compared to 3.36% for tablet users and 1.53% for smartphone users. To combat this, e-commerce companies can invest in frictionless payment options, shop-the-look features, and fast checkout practices to boost mobile conversion rates. Historically, consumers are more inclined to purchase certain products online than others, with electronics being a common choice. Additionally, the power of impulse shopping should always be considered. Aside from the ‚Äòclassic‚Äô insights for Samsung, let‚Äôs see what else we can gather from the latest Sales Signals. Firstly, Samsung launched its ‚ÄúAI for All‚Äù vision, a roadmap to developing AI. Similarly, Samsung launched the M54 model. Additionally, General Motors partnered with Samsung on May 1, 2024. Samsung also launched its AGI business recently. But that‚Äôs not all, folks. Let‚Äôs see what are the web technologies this top dog uses: Advertising: Ads Txt (installed June 2024), a tool that helps ensure digital ad inventory is only sold through authorized sellers such as AdSense Conversion & Analytics: Datadog (installed May 2024), a Cloud Monitoring as a Service platform for cloud-scale applications, offering monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services Customer Relationship: Salesforce (installed March 2024), provides customer relationship management software and applications focused on sales, customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics, and application development 3) Ebay.com As we continue the upward traffic trend, Ebay.com is up 4.19% in May, with a whopping 708.2M MoM visits and only a 92% YoY increase from last year. Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs been going on. Ebay.com‚Äôs largest traffic source in May was direct, with 317.9M visits, followed by organic search, with 292.8M visits. Diving into the numbers, the primary device driver for organic traffic is mobile, while for direct traffic, most users come from desktop. What else can we find out here? Checking out the keywords users are searching for, we see the biggest search term is ‚Äúebaymotors,‚Äù with a monthly search traffic of 16.9K. A quick visit at ebay.com to put the Similarweb Sales Intelligence Chrome extension to use. The insights tab of the extension gave us dozens of instantly AI-generated, real-time, actionable insights for ebay.com ‚Äî our favorite insight for eBay was this one: ‚ÄúYour total Pages Per Visit in May was 6.62, trailing behind Amazon and Mercari, yet ahead of AliExpress and Walmart. You might find it tough to keep visitors engaged compared to some competitors, affecting customer retention.‚Äù A simple metric + industry benchmarking = actionable insight that could impact revenue. Tweet this This brings us directly to eBay.com‚Äôs page views. As we saw earlier, organic‚Äôs biggest driver was mobile, and direct‚Äôs biggest was desktop. Both mobile and desktop had a nice increase in page views. Desktop saw a steady increase of 3.05%, while mobile increased by 4.44%. Way to go, eBay! How else does this ecommerce rockstar keep the revenue flowing? Here is the most recently installed website technology: Retargeting: Amplitude (installed April 2024), a product analytics and event tracking platform Marketing Automation: Dotomi (installed April 2024), a tool for personalized media display advertising that dynamically adapts in real time at the user and impression level Payment & Currencies: Venmo (installed February 2024), a popular app for electronically transferring funds between parties 4) Aliexpress.com Spot number three goes to aliexpress.com! With 580.6M total visits, aliexpress.com‚Äôs YoY growth is up 31.72%, and MoM growth is up 6.87%. But there‚Äôs more ‚Äî aliexpress.com is growing faster than the industry average (-0.14%). Aliexpress.com‚Äôs biggest traffic contributor is direct visits (330.7M), followed by organic search (100.6M). Additionally, a majority of its traffic comes from desktop, with 326.7M visits, while mobile brings in 251.7M visits. Unlike eBay.com, which has an almost even split between devices, AliExpress users favor visiting the site from their desktops. Diving deeper into aliexpress.com‚Äôs traffic & engagement, we see a MoM increase of 0.26% in pages per visit on mobile devices. This raises the question: why is desktop driving more traffic if users spend more time on the site from their mobile devices? But what are users searching for to land on aliexpress.com? Analyzing the keywords users are searching for, it‚Äôs clear they focus on tech products. We can see 80% of the top 15 searches are for these types of items, such as hand-held gaming devices, computer keyboards, and computer mice. Interestingly, in the last couple of years, Ali Express has invested a lot of time in installing different language options on its platform, including Hebrew, Arabic, Dutch, English, German, French, and more. They‚Äôve been working hard to become a global retailer for all our online shopping needs. Kudos to you, AliExpress! 5) Temu.com Is it surprising that Temu made it to the top five after its crazy surge this past year? Temu.com‚Äôs MoM and YoY growth has seen a significant increase ‚Äî 8.12% (2.855B) and 150.45% (544.2M), respectively. Temu‚Äôs visits via geography are: Japan at 17.82% United States at 16.69% Germany at 6.37% German users have also spent the longest duration on temu.com, averaging more than 10 minutes and 21 seconds. The Bounce Rate for temu.com has improved, with more people staying on the site longer than before, extending to desktop (1.67%) and mobile (1.66%). When we check the device usage, there‚Äôs nearly a 50-50 split between mobile and desktop. But where does all their traffic come from? It‚Äôs no surprise that the majority of temu.com‚Äôs traffic comes from direct search (184.2M), followed by paid search (166.6M), and organic search (90.4M). Interestingly, direct traffic comes primarily from desktop devices, while paid search has a larger mobile traffic trend. An effective paid search strategy that Temu has leveraged is bidding on branded search terms related to competitors and other retailers ‚Äî nearly 50% of their top 15 paid keyword terms. Let‚Äôs check out the top keywords. A quick visit to temu.com using the Similarweb Sales Intelligence Chrome extension provided interesting insights, including this one: ‚ÄúYour website, temu.com, has more pageviews than several key competitors as of May 2024. Like many businesses, you may find it challenging to fully understand and leverage this web traffic advantage.‚Äù What website technologies does this e-commerce giant use? Here are a few: Language: Moroccan Arabic (installed April 2024), a global provider for authenticating digital transactions Other: Google API (Installed March 2024), a programmatic interface to Google Cloud Platform services Payment Methods: CardinalCommerce (installed March 2024), a global provider for authenticating digital transactions Social: Instagram API (March 2024), an HTTP-based API that lets users import media from Instagram and connect their Instagram profiles Top fastest-growing ecommerce companies list in the world Ready to meet our May 2024 winners? Here‚Äôs a quick intro to the 15 fastest-growing global ecommerce companies: Rank Domain MoM Change Monthly Visits HQ country 1 currentlye.com 620.95% 1,099,954 Spain 2 footlocker.ph 423.61% 1,279,694 United States 3 themagic5.com 419.56% 1,355,507 United States 4 ubuy.iq 349.93% 1,747,252 Iraq 5 desiginn.com 303.41% 1,332,661 United States 6 tbdress.com 276.89% 1,201,543 United States 7 rawandrugged.in 250.98% 1,052,445 India 8 samash.com 249.58% 1,749,963 United States 9 dentrealmarket.com 212.55% 1,026,178 Turkey 10 wayoff.ru 186.50% 1,367,629 Russian Federation 11 acwo.com 181.94% 1,627,566 India 12 100grn.com.ua 178.52% 1,752,660 Ukraine 13 nike.cl 164.98% 4,845,232 United States 14 pureplains.com 160.59% 1,207,307 India 15 curlytools.com 158.24% 1,028,233 Netherlands Here‚Äôs the criteria we used to create this list (so you can do it too, with Similarweb Sales Intelligence): Geography: Worldwide Website Type: Ecommerce Website Technologies: Only sites with Ecommerce technologies Monthly Visits: Over 1 million Ranked by monthly visits increase, April 2024 vs. May 2024 Download the full list here: A deeper dive into the top 5 fastest-growing ecommerce companies in the world Here‚Äôs what we found out about these up-and-comers using Similarweb Sales Intelligence: 1) Currentlye.com The number one spot goes to currentlye.com with 1M total visits in May 2024 ‚Äî a 620.95% MoM growth and 1000% YoY growth. Talk about incredible expansion! Who and what is currentlye.com? According to their website, they claim: ‚ÄúWe offer you the best home goods and stylish products. We have selected premium items from around the world, offering you high-quality options, and are dedicated to providing you with a beautiful life, allowing you to experience all aspects of refined living in one place.‚Äù After checking them out further, we see they haven‚Äôt yet done much work on their SEO strategy. Instead, they focused on social media, which is their biggest traffic provider with 99.49% of total visits, followed by direct with a minor 0.51%. Since social is huge with currentlye.com, the most used device is not surprisingly mobile. Looking at currentlye.com‚Äôs traffic and engagement metrics, we see that their pages per visit increased by 37.27% on mobile in May, leading to a significant growth in visit duration (+1544%). Once consumers land on currentlye.com‚Äôs site, they spend more time browsing through more pages. Let‚Äôs check out the website technologies used by this fastest-growing global ecommerce site: Document Standard: Canonical Tag (installed August 2023), a tool that is an HTML element that helps webmasters prevent duplicate content issues by specifying the ‚Äúcanonical,‚Äù or ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù version Payment & Currencies: JCB (installed May 2023), a Japanese card company, credit card issuer, merchant acquirer, and provider of payment technology solutions Advertising: Facebook Advertiser (installed November 2022), the platform for running ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger 2) Footlocker.ph The runner-up spot goes to footlocker.ph, which saw significant growth with 423.61% MoM and 916.67M% YoY, totaling 1.279M visits in May 2024. What was driving this growth? In February 2024, footlocker.ph saw approximately 1.28M visits. Most of this traffic, around 1.03M visits, came from organic search, indicating a strong presence in search engine results. direct traffic also contributed significantly, with around 210K visits. Other channels, such as social media, referrals, and email, contributed minimally, with 27.9K, 7.7K, and 353 visits, respectively. Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs going on with SEO. Although the Adidas Samba shoe is trendy this year, New Balance sneakers have yet to disappear. This single topic makes up 53% of the top 15 keywords, with some mentions of Vans and Hoka shoes. When we visit the ‚Äòheart of sneakers‚Äô website, what does Similarweb‚Äôs SAM reveal? We see that the average pages per visit benchmark for Footlocker.ph is lower than Shonami but higher than Urban Athletics, Park Outlet, and Commonwealth. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into Footlocker.ph‚Äôs pages per visit. The average pages per visit (desktop and mobile combined) is 6.23, showing a steady increase from April‚Äôs average of 5.17 pages per visit. With the increase in average pages per visit, there is a direct correlation with a positive Bounce Rate improvement (-30.65%). Foot Locker is doing something right with its related products, keeping users on its site. What‚Äôs another way to drive organic results? Installing top-notch website technologies that make your ecommerce site operate faster, like those used by hindware.com: Language: English HREF Language (installed June 2023) Advertising: DoubleClick (installed May 2023), a search management platform that enables agencies and advertisers to create, manage, report on, and optimize search campaigns Audio Video Media: Vimeo (installed April 2023), an AI-powered video platform 3) Themagic5.com As we continue down the list of the top five fastest-growing global companies, we reach the third spot with THEMAGIC5. Themagic5.com has seen steady growth MoM (419.56%) and YoY (583.19%), with 1.355M total visits. When checking the traffic by channel, organic search (36.15%) and direct (32.29%) are almost neck and neck. Mobile devices drive a significant portion of visitors (412.4K) compared to desktops (55K). Although mobile is high for all the other companies, we have yet to see a driver this strong. Why are these two channels so close to each other? What keywords are users searching for? After investigating the keywords, we see that even ‚Äònon-branded‚Äô searches still include the brand name. Themagic5.com has strong brand awareness, possibly because the company‚Äôs founders appeared on Shark Tank, or their goggles are so well-known. Either way, they know what they‚Äôre doing! Whether you‚Äôre a big Shark Tank fan or not, this brand pitched its idea on live TV, and regardless of their outcome on the show, these numbers don‚Äôt lie. What website technologies does THEMAGIC5 use? Well, here are a few: Widget: General Captcha (installed May 2024), websites using some form of Captcha technology Affiliate Marketing: CJ Affiliate by Conversant (installed May 2024), a leading affiliate marketing network Server: Microsoft (installed November 2023), a group of server operating systems developed by Microsoft 4) Ubuy.iq The fourth spot goes to ubuy.iq. In May 2024, the new player on the block had 1.747M total visits, a 349.93% MoM growth, and a +1,000% YoY growth (faster than the industry average of 2.85%). Like THEMAGIC5, ubuy.iq has a massive mobile user base at 99.32%. Continuing with the device trend, let‚Äôs analyze which channel drives the most traffic. organic search brings in most of the traffic (68.78%), followed by direct (26.52%) and referrals (3.61%). Since organic is the highest driver, what keywords are users searching for? Users search for computers, beauty products, art supplies, and more. It looks like ubuy.iq carries everything. What website technologies does ubuy.iq use to keep the business going? Document Shared: Content Security Policy (installed June 2023), a tool used as a defense-in-depth, to reduce the harm caused by content injection attacks Mobile: Android App Links (installed June 2023), apps that link to your content can be then use this metadata to deep-link into your app, take users to an app store to download the app, or take them directly to the web to view the content Multilingual: Multilingual Support (installed June 2023), a tool that helps sites support more than one language 5) Desiginn.com We saved the sleekest for last: desiginn.com. In May 2024, the site had 1.332M total visits, a 303.41% MoM increase, growing faster than the industry average (-3.13%). Like the other top fastest-growing e-commerce sites, Design Inn is mobile-friendly (100%, in fact). When investigating desiginn.com, we see that 80.31% of their traffic was direct, and the other 19.69% came from Social. Unlike some of the other brands we‚Äôve looked at, there is no traffic from organic search. It seems Design Inn is investing more in its social media strategy, like Currentlye. We checked their website and saw that they sell kitchen appliances, so we ran to their social media channels. On Instagram, they have a plethora of products and discounts for customers. As users scroll through their Instagram feed, they‚Äôll land on a Design Inn post, explore their page, and then head to the company‚Äôs website to see what other products are offered. From there, we noticed that the average Page Views MoM increased by 202% as users browsed more pages on desiginn.com‚Äôs site. Consumers are looking for more products by Design Inn to purchase for their homes. Let‚Äôs check out what technologies this newcomer is using to fuel its growth: Advertising: Taboola Advertiser (installed February 2024), an ad discovery platform Ecommerce: Shopify Product Reviews (installed February 2024), help you collect feedback about your store and products, and can provide your customers with helpful information when considering a purchase Content Delivery Network: Imgix (installed December 2023), an API-based visual media platform Go beyond the top 50 If you want to pull ecommerce insights like these in seconds ‚Äî and we think you might ‚Äî book a demo to find out just how Similarweb Sales Intelligence can help you uncover your ideal prospects, their tech setups, and their pain points for 2024.
