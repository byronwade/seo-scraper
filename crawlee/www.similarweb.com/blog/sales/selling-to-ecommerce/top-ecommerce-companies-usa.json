Using Similarweb Sales Intelligence tells us precisely that. Let‚Äôs see it in action with a deep dive into the top 5 ecommerce companies in the US in June 2024: 1. Amazon.com With close to 24 million ecommerce businesses to shop at, the consistent top choice of consumers is no surprise; it‚Äôs Amazon. What might be surprising is that amazon.com‚Äôs year-over-year (YoY) is down 2.63%, and month-over-month (MoM) visits are down 0.74%. New ecommerce competitors emerge on the scene every day, but 1.743B total visits in June point to Amazon‚Äôs strong stay power. Amazon.com‚Äôs largest traffic source was direct, with 1B visits, followed by organic search, with 417.1M visits. Although amazon.com is seeing a dip in website visits, it‚Äôs also seeing positive changes to engagement metrics ‚Äî specifically, Bounce Rates have improved by 0.28% on desktop. As mentioned, Direct and Organic Search led the charge in driving traffic to Amazon. So, what was the world looking for that led them to the site? Short answer: everything and anything. Slightly longer answer: these are the 15 most popular organic non-branded keywords for June‚Ä¶ prime video prime gaming prime aws kindle cloud reader kindle the boys send to kindle prime video login freevee twitch prime seller central amazonprime kdp aws login Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Kindle-related search terms made up 60% of the top 15. Also in the top 15 is an Amazon original (and exclusive) series, The Boys. We also see Seller Central (the portal sellers can enter to get into their Amazon accounts) made it to the top 15, and Freevee (an Amazon TV channel). 5 out of 15 top organic, non-branded keywords for amazon.com saw positive MoM change ‚Äî The Boys specifically saw an impressive 754.73% MoM increase. 2. Ebay.com eBay is one of the first ecomemerce companies to create and market an online business connecting buyers and sellers of goods and services. And eBay has also become another household name. Like its predecessor, eBay.com‚Äôs June traffic decreased from 546M to 539M total visits YoY (1.34%). Even though ebay.com‚Äôs MoM total visits were down -2.06%, there‚Äôs been an uptick in June for Pages Per Visit on desktop (0.37%) and mobile web (0.19%). Jumping over to the channels that drove the most traffic, direct visits brought in the most (258.8M), followed by organic search (205M), and then paid search (28.4M). These three channels contributed 48.05%, 38.05%, and 5.27%, respectively, to the total traffic. What were people really searching for on eBay? The short answer: the unexpected.
