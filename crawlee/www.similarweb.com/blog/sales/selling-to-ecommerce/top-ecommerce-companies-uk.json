That‚Äôs where Similarweb Sales Intelligence comes in. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into the top 5 ecommerce sites to see it in action: 1. Amazon.co.uk It‚Äôs no surprise that Amazon.co.uk holds the number one spot‚Äîwould you expect anything else? Let‚Äôs see where the giant stands in July. Amazon reached 343.0M total visits, which is a +9.55% Month-over-Month (MoM) increase. However, it‚Äôs interesting to note it had a -4.75% Year-over-Year (YoY) change. Amazon has nearly doubled the number of visits compared to eBay.co.uk (which holds the second spot on our list). Focusing on Amazon‚Äôs web traffic and engagement, we see positive changes in bounce rates: a 0.41% improvement on mobile devices and a 2.94% improvement on desktop devices. While there‚Äôs a direct correlation between this improvement and Prime Day (with customers browsing more pages and building their carts for the big sale), it‚Äôs worth monitoring in the coming months for further opportunities. In terms of traffic sources, direct traffic led with 59.63%. The runner-ups were organic search at 25.93% and paid search at 7.23%. Amazon.co.uk is ecommerce üëë royalty ‚Äì they hardly need to invest in search because they have such a strong household name. But for other ecommerce sites aiming to follow in Amazon‚Äôs footsteps, it‚Äôs worth investing more in their SEO strategy. So, when consumers weren‚Äôt going directly to Amazon.co.uk, what were they searching for that led them there? The short answer: entertainment. The longer answer lies in these 15 most popular non-branded organic keywords for July: prime video prime prime day the boys kindle seller central prime video uk prime day 2024 seller central uk prime video | watch movies, tv shows, live tv, and sports the boys season 4 kindle cloud reader kindle store amazonassociates send to kindle uk Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Kindle-related search terms made up 67% of the top 15. Unsurprisingly, the keyword with the most significant change was ‚Äúprime day,‚Äù with an impressive 3,946.39% MoM increase, directly linked to Prime Day 2024 on July 16-17. However, one of the more intriguing keywords is ‚Äúthe boys‚Äù with 48.8K monthly visits. The Boys is a show about a group of vigilantes out to take down corrupt superheroes who have abused their powers. It‚Äôs almost like the superheroes have become villains, and a new set of good guys has emerged. We‚Äôve enjoyed the show ‚Äî are you ready to add it to your watch list? 2. eBay.co.uk eBay‚Äôs bread and butter is its auction-based platform, and while they‚Äôve leaned more towards fixed-price listings like Amazon, they‚Äôll never abandon auctions. Would you bet on ebay.co.uk securing the second spot on this list for July? We certainly would. In July, the auction site hit 184.6M total visits! eBay saw a +3.9% MoM increase, but their -9.99% YoY decrease is a bit unexpected. The YoY drop could be attributed to the competitors‚Äô rise in traffic. We noticed decreases in direct visits, organic traffic, and referral traffic for ebay.co.uk. On a positive note, page views on desktop (up 5.1%) and mobile (up 2.9%) showed increases. This made us curious about whether pages per visit also saw a rise. While desktop did see an increase, we were surprised to find that mobile had a slight decrease (-0.03%). This could suggest that the pages viewed on mobile devices weren‚Äôt as user-friendly as those on desktop, contributing to the slight decline. Most of ebay‚Äôs July traffic came from direct visits (63.54%), followed by organic search (25.95%), and then paid search (4.59%). eBay has become so well-known that it barely needs to invest in SEO anymore. When people think of auctions or getting products at lower prices, they instinctively go straight to eBay. This strategy seems to have worked well over the years. Perhaps other sites will follow suit in the near future. Let‚Äôs see! What drove UK shoppers to ebay.co.uk? The answer: some intriguing searches. Or, to be precise, here are eBay‚Äôs 15 most popular non-branded organic keywords for July: homely_haven spider-man 3 ictv 35 mm terapeak BMW e30 70s dagger collar blouse women‚Äôs angela anaconda vhs dj tv man corrupted cameraman saucony shadow 6000 size 12 cancel bid casio oceanus ocw-s100-1ajf opaque wood finish products vintage ufc shirt 39157471 sesshomaru x inuyasha Is retro fashion the new modern trend? The keyword with the most significant change was ‚Äú70s dagger collar blouse women‚Äôs,‚Äù with an increase of 236.24%. Following this long-tail keyword closely, ‚Äúvintage ufc shirt‚Äù saw the next highest increase at 234.93%. It looks like vintage clothing is making a comeback in the fashion world. How would you style these shirts? We‚Äôd pair them with classic straight jeans and a pair of Samba shoes. 3. Argos.co.uk Argos.co.uk is next on our list, with 38.90M total visits in July. Did you know the site was established in 1972 and named after the Greek city of Argos? Pretty cool, right? The site saw a +9.21% MoM increase and a -13.42% YoY decrease. The YoY decrease could be linked to seasonality, as Argos and its key competitors have also experienced a similar trend. We were curious about what happened over the past year for Argos, so we checked the sales signals and found that the site had several new launches, including a Halloween Shop, Apple Watch Ultra, and a range of SIM-free phones. When it comes to Argos‚Äôs web traffic and engagement, we focused on visit duration. Both desktop and mobile saw increases of 2.29% and 1.66%, respectively. We then looked at the rest of the metrics, and, unsurprisingly, everything was in the green. Argos, keep up the great work ‚Äì it‚Äôs paying off! Unlike our top two contenders, who received the most visits from direct traffic, argos.co.uk saw the most traffic from organic search (40.51%), followed by direct traffic (38.94%). The next biggest traffic driver was paid search, accounting for 13.88%. Despite being one of the top five eCommerce sites, Argos continues to find significant value in effective SEO strategies. So, what brought such high clicks to Argos.co.uk? Here are Argos‚Äôs 15 most popular non-branded organic UK keywords for July: ps5 controller ps5 office chair sofa bed treadmill fridge freezer gaming laptop microwave fan ipad shoe rack dyson fan tv ps4 controller fridge 33% of the top 15 keywords are related to household items (office chair, sofa bed, treadmill), while 20% are kitchen-related (fridge freezer, microwave, fridge). It seems that many people were sprucing up their homes. If we had the chance, we‚Äôd remodel our office room too! 4. Etsy.com Etsy.com is the go-to site for finding the perfect handmade gift, vintage or on-trend clothes, unique jewelry, and anything else your heart desires. The ecommerce site had 37.37M total visits in July, reflecting a +2.08% MoM increase and a -9.24% YoY decrease. In such a highly competitive landscape, the YoY drop might be driven by online consumers flocking to AliExpress, which saw a YoY increase and offers lower prices for mass-produced goods. Moving on to Etsy‚Äôs Traffic and Engagement metrics, we see that bounce rates improved on both desktop (5.81%) and mobile devices (3.71%), indicating high user stickiness. After further analysis, we discovered that Etsy ran targeted marketing campaigns that attracted more relevant visitors to the site, leading to longer site engagement and a reduced bounce rate. The main traffic source for etsy.com was direct, contributing 49.44%, followed by organic search at 30.25% and paid search at 11.04%. Social media also brought in 6.61% of visits. When it comes to direct traffic, mobile (49.08%) and desktop (50.92%) brought in nearly the same amount of visits. Etsy is a unique site, known as a platform where small businesses can earn income and expand their reach globally. Consumers can find just about anything within reason, which likely explains why direct traffic is so high ‚Äì everyone knows Etsy. Here are Etsy‚Äôs 15 most popular non-branded organic UK keywords for July‚Ä¶ esy taylor swift eras tour poster 70s dagger collar blouse women‚Äôs mental health coping skills diagram sparkle digital planners preppy logo designs birth flower drawings ety buy gold bar gold zeus esty tote bag sjbcrafts Florida highway patrol seal vector euros 2024 new jersey state police badge new jersey state police badge vector Within this set of keywords, we again see within the top 10 the phrase ‚Äú70s dagger collar blouse women‚Äôs,‚Äù indicating a strong interest among women in adding this retro style to their wardrobes ‚Äì as it‚Äôs a top keyword also on ebay.co.uk. It‚Äôs also no surprise that ‚Äútaylor swift eras tour poster‚Äù holds the second spot, given that Taylor Swift‚Äôs Eras Tour is currently making its way around the world. 5. Next.co.uk The final spot on our top 5 list goes next.co.uk. It‚Äôs the destination for all the latest women‚Äôs, men‚Äôs, and children‚Äôs fashion, beauty products, homeware, and much more. The UK-based ecommerce site had 28.90M total visits in July. Next also saw a 3.69% MoM increase but experienced a 12.6% YoY decrease. As we examined next.co.uk‚Äôs sales signals, we noticed that over the last year, the site has partnered with Biscuiteers Baking Company, acquired Fat Face Ltd, hired a new executive director, and appointed a new CFO‚Äîit looks like a lot of new things ‚Äì and a lot of potential growth ‚Äì are on the horizon. However, this could also create a sense of uncertainty for consumers. The Traffic and Engagement metrics for Next‚Äôs July performance are showing overall growth. When we looked at page views, we saw a significant jump of 27% on desktop and 3.63% on mobile. That‚Äôs the biggest increase compared to the other top four ecommerce sites on our list! The sites aiming to break into the top 5 could learn a thing or two from next.co.uk. The channel contributing the most to next.co.uk‚Äôs July traffic was direct, accounting for around 45.39%, followed by organic search at 39.76%. The site‚Äôs user-friendly interface makes it easy for consumers to explore from their mobile devices. Whether at home, on the way to work, or at the gym, consumers can effortlessly build a shopping cart for their next shopping spree. What were consumers organically searching for that led them to next.co.uk? Primarily clothes and furniture. Here are Next‚Äôs 15 most popular non-branded organic UK keywords for July‚Ä¶ laura ashley lipsy lipsy london curtains dining chairs dining table jobs near me cargo shorts wedding guest dresses mens jackets suit linen trousers men swim shorts cath kidston birkenstock 40% of the top 15 keywords in this dataset are related to clothing articles (‚Äúcargo shorts,‚Äù ‚Äúwedding guest dresses,‚Äù ‚Äúmen‚Äôs jackets‚Äù). Meanwhile, 33% of the searches are for specific brands (‚Äúlipsy,‚Äù ‚Äúcath kidston,‚Äù ‚Äúlaura ashley,‚Äù ‚Äúpour moi‚Äù). Since next.co.uk owns the brands listed among the top keywords, we wonder which company might be next on their acquisition list.

Michaelkors.co.uk Michael Kors is the go-to destination for jet-set luxury, as they say. In July, the fashion site had 1.152M total visits. They experienced a +73.74% MoM increase but a -14.84% YoY decrease, which is likely attributed to fluctuations in paid search. Looking at Michael Kors‚Äôs Traffic and Engagement performance, visit duration improved on desktop by 0.82% and on mobile by 12.41%. With visit duration increasing, one might expect improvements in bounce rate, as users spend more time on the site. However, the bounce rate actually saw slight declines on desktop by 0.13% and on mobile by 1.98%. This suggests the site could benefit from optimizing its marketing efforts to attract visitors who are more likely to stay engaged‚Äîor perhaps take a page from Etsy‚Äôs campaign playbook. The largest contributors to michaelkors.co.uk‚Äôs July traffic were direct (41.62%), paid search (40.99%), and social (9.41%). Referrals also brought in 3.75%. With a nice stream of traffic coming in from social media, we wanted to investigate this a bit more. We noticed that 48.74% came from Facebook, 25.2% came from Reddit, and 18.85% came from YouTube. With a successful strategy here ‚Äì it‚Äôs always worth reviving campaigns here to reach your target audience. Were you, too, curious as to what brought visitors to michaelkors.co.uk? Here are Michael Kors‚Äô most popular organic UK keywords for July: kors micahel kors shoulder bag mini camille pave hand bags women large crossgrain leather smartphone wristlet mk t shirts women‚Äôs handbag mickeal kors discounts watches for women flap backpack in price range ¬£1000 hand bag women sale handbag tota bag purse racer jacket men The keyword that saw the largest MoM change was ‚Äúwatches for women,‚Äù with a 218.75% increase, indicating a growing interest in this category. If you also sell watches, particularly for women, it might be worth ramping up your marketing efforts ‚Äì and finding review sites and affiliates in the fashion space ‚Äì in order to capitalize on this trend. 2. Beaverbrooks.co.uk Beaverbrooks is a luxury jewelry provider in the UK that was established in 1919. In July, the site had 1.161M total visits, a 52.98% MoM increase. We wondered if fewer visitors to the site would negatively impact Traffic and Engagement for Beaverbrooks. To our surprise, we noticed page views trending upwards on both desktop (33.07%) and mobile (106.38%). Americangolf.co.uk‚Äôs July performance is a 24.31% YoY and a 53.49% MoM change. And the site‚Äôs Traffic & Engagement performance is also on the rise! Metrics to watch for americangolf.co.uk include Visit Duration on Desktop (00:04:56, up 28.37% MoM), Pages Per Visit on Desktop (7.04, up 9.94%), and Bounce Rate on Desktop (32.43%, up 6.41%). And of course, Page Views (see image) Although organic search (33.26%) was the largest contributor to Beaverbrooks‚Äôs traffic, followed by direct (31.95%) and paid search (22.89%), direct traffic showed the largest growth compared to the previous month (+74%). This suggests that the fast-growing fashion brand has built a strong reputation. So, while overall YoY traffic may be lower, those visiting the site are engaging more because they are familiar with (and trust) the brand. Given that organic search brought in the most traffic, let‚Äôs take a look at Beaverbrooks‚Äô top 15 organic searches for July‚Ä¶ engagement rings jewellery mens jewellery mens wedding rings skeleton watches gold watches for men ring size 8 cm circumference bracelet watches sale sale watches watch sale bracelets for women silver necjlaces black diamond pearl necklace uk Among the top 15 keywords, 46% of the searches include the word ‚Äúring.‚Äù So, although it‚Äôs not proposal season just yet, visitors are starting to prepare for that big diamond purchase for their significant other. 3. Joebrowns.co.uk Joebrowns.co.uk, an apparel and homeware site, saw impressive growth in July with 1.011M visits‚Äîa +41.5% MoM and +3.89% YoY increase. This uptick suggests early preparations for the holiday season. In terms of Joe Browns‚Äô web traffic and engagement, page views per visit rose on desktop (+13.65%) and mobile (+2.89%). However, while mobile visit duration increased by 11.05%, desktop duration fell by 6.79%. This indicates a need for desktop site optimization to enhance user experience. Direct traffic was the largest source in July, accounting for 40.44% of visits, followed by paid search, which was exceptionally high at 24.68%, and organic search (19.30%). Let‚Äôs dive a bit deeper into which keywords the site targeted in their paid search efforts as they outperformed their competitors‚Ä¶ joe brown sale shoes joe brown sale uk half-sleeve sexy red ladies blouses nydj high waist denim pencil skirt, optic white tankini blue turquoise joe brownsknotted italian suede hobo bag men shirts uk coloured pin stripe linen suit with waistcoat crochet jumpers mens purple and black jumper joe brown suede hobo bag men‚Äôs long brown coats womens flared pants 80s shirts colourful cardigans for women Joe Browns is capitalizing on seasonal items like ‚Äútankini blue turquoise‚Äù and trendy pieces like the ‚Äúcoloured pin stripe linen suit with waistcoat.‚Äù Notably, ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs flared pants 80s‚Äù suggests that 80‚Äôs fashion could make a comeback this fall‚Äîperhaps paired with a 70‚Äôs dagger-collared blouse. 4. Cotswoldoutdoor.com Cotswoldoutdoor.com secured the final spot on the list of the fastest-growing UK eCommerce sites, with 1.075M total visits in July, reflecting a +39.1% MoM increase and a -6.37% YoY decrease. The YoY drop can be attributed to seasonality, as consumers typically spend less on outdoor supplies by July. Despite the seasonal impact, Cotswold Outdoor‚Äôs traffic shows that users are still exploring it. Visit duration increased significantly ‚Äì 26.42% on desktop and 47.31% on mobile ‚Äì indicating that shoppers are already in holiday season mode. Organic search was the top traffic source, accounting for 56.79% of visits, followed by direct traffic at 29.95% and paid search at 7.23%. With half of the traffic coming from organic search, other companies could learn from Cotswold Outdoor‚Äôs effective SEO strategy. So, what organic keywords drove traffic to cotswoldoutdoor.com? The short answer: anything related to the outdoors. Here are the top 15 searches in July‚Ä¶ outdoor and cycle concepts outdoor and cycle concepts ltd fjallraven arcteryx craghoppers heat regulating travel sock hydroflask uk camping duffel bag north face fleece two person backpacking tent hiking trousers outdoor shop cotswolds outdoors near me patagonia houdini mens v12 outdoor the north face women aphrodite 2.0 trousers scarpa walking shoes The keyword with the largest MoM change was ‚Äúcamping duffel bag,‚Äù which saw an 829.95% increase. We‚Äôre curious about what users are packing in those bags, as they might not be the most comfortable choice for hiking. 5. Levi.com The final spot on our top UK fastest-growing list goes to the iconic Levi.com. Levi‚Äôs web traffic showed 1.365M visits in July ‚Äì a 37.31% MoM increase and a 5.98% YoY rise. This growth can be attributed to several strategic moves over the past year, including adding a new member to it‚Äôs Board of Directors, partnering with Anthropic Limited, and opening new regional offices in Asia and Canada. In terms of Traffic and Engagement, page views increased significantly on both desktop (56.39%) and mobile (13.81%). Levi‚Äôs appears to have optimized its desktop site, leading to a notable uptick in desktop visits in July, reversing the trend of mobile dominance over the past five months. While mobile is crucial for ecommerce, maintaining a strong desktop experience remains vital. Unsurprisingly, in light of its brand recognition, direct traffic was the leading traffic source, accounting for 41.88% of visits, followed by organic search (24.86%) and paid search (21.45%). Social media contributed 8.03%, showing that Levi‚Äôs is a well-established household name that attracts visitors naturally. Focusing on Levi.com‚Äôs social media traffic (on desktop), we observed steady growth from February to July. Most of their campaigns targeted Facebook, which drove 42.17% of the traffic, followed by YouTube at 22.86%. This is a strategy that other retailers might consider adopting.
