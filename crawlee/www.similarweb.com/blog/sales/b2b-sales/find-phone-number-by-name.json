September 30, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic For most of you, gone are the days of the Yellow Pages and phonebook ‚Äì manual ones anyway. So, how do you get the contact information you need when you only have the name of a prospect and the company they work for to go by? And in a modern age where privacy matters more than ever, how do you not be creepy about it? When it comes to prospecting, cold sales emails and cold calls both have their pros and cons. Cold emails are often seen as the easier and quicker option for salespeople, but cold calls can be far more effective in getting direct responses. We look into the ways you can find a phone number by name, in the least creepy way possible: 1) Google search First up: the classic Google search. Or, if you‚Äôre not a Google fan, typing into your search engine of choice. When trying to find a phone number by name, searching the internet is probably your immediate thought. But you‚Äôll face some issues, mainly down to the fact that the internet ‚Äì and the world itself ‚Äì is a big place. We hate to disappoint, but it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôre the only person in the world with your name. That‚Äôs the same for your prospect. Just a quick example: when you google my name, you‚Äôll find the majority of search results are Daily Mail articles about a former participant on Teen Mom. No author pages or bios, and certainly none of my contact details. The fact of the matter is, this method might take some sifting through search, videos, and images ‚Äì and you know what that means? T i m e. If your prospect‚Äôs contact details are in the top results when you search their name, ideal. If you‚Äôre scrolling through pages and pages to find that all-important phone number, you‚Äôre taking up time when you could be talking to more available prospects. Not to mention the more pages you go through, the more invasive it can come across (and no one likes the realization their privacy settings aren‚Äôt so tight). And with that‚Ä¶ Creepy factor: 3/10* *the more pages you search, the higher that number gets 2) Social media search Another free ‚Äì but possibly quite creepy ‚Äì option is social media. Now, this search can be divided between a few social media platforms, with LinkedIn being the most popular as a professional network, but let‚Äôs not forget Twitter. More and more people use social media to stay in touch, so you can find a phone number under their name or in their About sections if they‚Äôve chosen to share it. So, the first step is to check out your prospect‚Äôs LinkedIn profile to check for a business phone number. Not there? Okay fine, check Twitter. Their phone number might be in their bio if you‚Äôre lucky, but you can also check past tweets. You might find correspondences between salespeople that had the same idea as you, where your prospect has written something similar to ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk, (555) 555-1234‚Äù. Again, this could take some serious snooping if your prospect isn‚Äôt offering up their number in their bio. So for that, we award this method with a‚Ä¶ Creepy factor: 9/10 3) Lead Generator tool Okay, so this isn‚Äôt an entirely free method, but with Similarweb Sales Intelligence, you can get all your ideal prospects‚Äô contact details ‚Äì as well as other contacts and decision-makers at the company ‚Äì and download them straight into HubSpot or Salesforce in just a couple of clicks.
