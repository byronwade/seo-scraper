Famously hated by salespeople everywhere, the cold email is a universal source of pain for SDRs. What is a cold sales email? A cold sales email is what a salesperson sends to prospects that they’ve had no previous communication or relationship with. It’s what initiates dialogue with a lot of prospects, and if you nail it, it can lead to a shiny, new deal. ✨ Why are they so hated by salespeople? First, because it’s hard to know what to say. Second, because no one likes spending time writing an email when you know there’s a high chance you won’t get a reply. And third, no one likes feeling spammy. But here’s the thing: the cold email is a necessity in the game of sales. Done right, it provides you and your prospect with a number of benefits, including: Kicking off communication with a new prospect (and hopefully, an eventual customer). Offering value by providing information, resources, new connections and positioning yourself as a trusted advisor or consultant. Engaging your prospect with a relevant solution to them and their business goals. Setting the tone for any future dialogue, as well as what to expect from then on. So, how do you write a cold sales email that will actually get a response? Check out this guide for an overview of best practices AND some cold sales email templates you can start using today. Cold sales emails best practices Here are nine best practices to plug into your outreach strategy to help you write cold sales emails: 1) Don’t skip over sales prospecting Sales prospecting is essential to writing a successful cold email. We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: targeting irrelevant prospects is unlikely to lead to a deal. Instead, you’ll just end up wasting time and energy that could have been directed at viable leads. Sales prospecting allows you to create a list of contacts that fit specific criteria as defined by your ideal customer profile (ICP). To perform prospecting in the most effective way possible, you need to gain an intimate understanding of your ICP and customer personas. Ask yourself questions like: What is their company profile? What are their pain points, goals, and challenges? Where do they see opportunities? How do they aim to compete in their market? Once you’ve defined a clear set of parameters, you can start narrowing down a large pool of prospects into a strategic list of highly relevant ones. Similarweb’s Sales Intelligence solution empowers SDRs to easily identify their ideal prospects by analyzing its database of more than 100 million websites according to any criteria. 2) Do your research Once you’ve completed your sales prospecting and developed a tasty list of prospects, research the individuals you plan to reach out to. You should know these basics before drafting your email: Their full name Their role in the company Career history Recent promotions Achievements (in current and previous roles) At the same time, you’ll want to understand what triggers the company to buy. In the past, did certain contexts, events, or needs drive the prospect’s company to purchase a new solution or service? When you’ve got these facts in the bag, you’ll have a deeper understanding of the conditions required to (hopefully) drive a successful sale. This will help you frame your pitch and intro when you write your cold sales email, too. Once you’ve collected all of this information, jot down detailed notes in your CRM so you can refer to them later. 3) Write a strong subject line Nail that subject line : Make it short: Make sure the entire thing is visible and doesn’t get cut off in your prospect’s inbox. Avoid marketing lingo or spammy attention grabbers: Your subject line should look like you wrote it, not your marketing department’s copywriter… and definitely not a bot. Check for typos: Spelling errors, poor punctuation, and other mistakes in your subject line might signal to your prospect that your work is sloppy or you don’t care enough to edit your emails before you hit send. Keep your promises: A compelling subject line is only a good subject line if your email fulfills its promise. For example, you shouldn’t write, “[Name], take advantage of our 20% off discount,” and then not mention the discount again in your email. 4) Write the way you speak Please – we beg – avoid using business jargon or writing in an unnaturally formal voice. People want to get through their emails fast. Your best bet is to keep it simple and clear. Always be professional, but not overly formal. 5) Avoid huge paragraphs of text Large chunks of text aren’t easy on the eye. They’re not “skimmable” and they’re likely to drive prospects who open your email away before they even read it. Your entire email should be in the range of five to seven short sentences (125 words max, with 50-100 words being the ideal length). To ensure fast and easy reading of your message, separate your sentences into short paragraphs. 6) Minimize your use of “I,” “we,” and “our” It’s not about you. If you want to start an engaging correspondence with a prospect, you need to make it all about them. We get it, this can be difficult when you’re trying to pitch your product or explain while you’re worth talking to. The answer? Transform your sentences to be more encompassing of the company you’re talking to. Take a look at this: V1: “We have a brand new feature that I think you’d be interested in” V2: “As your company continues pursuing [goal], you could definitely benefit from our latest feature” See what we did there? 7) Make it personal Look for ways to personalize your cold sales emails as much as possible. You can do this by mentioning achievements, needs, or challenges that are relatable for your prospect. With Similarweb’s Sales Intelligence Insights Generator, you can gain full visibility into a prospect’s digital strategy, performance, and competition. Allowing you to effortlessly identify a variety of business insights, you will not only capture your prospect’s attention, but also immediately show you have done your homework and have real value to offer. Show them how many more sales they could make if they expanded their service to an untapped region. Or, point out that their competitor has just adopted a similar technology to help them skyrocket, to give new capabilities that your prospect will probably want to match. Similarweb helps you easily produce these findings, so you can plug useful nuggets of information into your sales emails and jumpstart your conversations. 8) Name drop Name-dropping other companies on your customer roster – especially well-known ones – helps you build credibility and trust among your prospects. Social proof allows you to demonstrate that other companies trust you enough to continue doing business with you. It shows that your solution or service meets other companies’ standards, offers value, and – presumably – provides an ROI. Hot tip: Case studies and concrete performance numbers will bolster your social proof, making this tactic even more effective. 9) Include a clear CTA At the end of your email, it should be obvious what you expect your prospect to do next. Should they respond with certain information? Do you want them to suggest times for a meeting? Do you want them to book a time slot on your Calendly? A common mistake SDRs make when writing sales emails is not making this clear. By including one CTA — preferably at the end — you can avoid confusion and improve your chances of getting a reply. Make it as easy as possible for them to take the next steps. 5 cold sales email templates you can start using today Feeling creatively blocked? Not sure where to start off?
