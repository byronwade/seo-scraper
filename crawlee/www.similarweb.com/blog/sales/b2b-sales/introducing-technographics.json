October 31, 2019 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Want to generate leads and qualify prospects based on the technologies they have installed on their site? We’ve got you covered. With our technographics offering, you can see what types of web analytics tools, call tracking systems, live chats, and other technologies your leads have installed. Say what? This is a really cool addition to our workspace because it will allow you to better qualify prospects that are a good fit for your product or service, and tailor your outreach according to a prospects’ current technology stack. Just choose whether you want to exclude or include technology, or technology categories. This dataset is available within the lead generator in the sales workspace. You can add other metrics such as website traffic, amount of unique visitors, or any other metrics you use to qualify leads. When you build a new lead list, website technologies is another filter you can include, in addition to country, website category, traffic sources, demographics, and others. But let’s take a step back and review what exactly it is, and the ways in which you can use this powerful technology. What Is Technographics Data? Technographics is the ability to see what technologies your prospects are using on their website. This is huge because it lets you have a privileged view of the types of technologies your prospects purchase, drop, and use to make their businesses work. Using technographics data will allow you to target and qualify your prospects based on the technology. For more qualifying and prospecting tips, download our report below. How Are Technographics Useful Technographics can help you in three meaningful ways: Checking for competitor technologies You would use this to identify if a prospect uses a competitor’s technology, and pitch your value relative to the incumbent. For example, let’s say you’re PayPal and you know your prospects are using a competitor’s payment technology which has a higher transaction fee. Reach out to prospects by highlighting your lower transaction fees in your outreach. This is a great start to a conversation with prospects because you’re pitching them something they’re already using (a payment tool), but with the added value of lower transaction fees. Checking for complementary technologies You would use this to identify if a prospect uses a complementary technology that can simplify processes, increase your value, or increase the value of the technology they’ve already purchased. For example, DHL has an app that integrates with Shopify that’s easy to install and allows any Shopify site to begin easily shipping with DHL. You can use technographics to find all companies using Shopify but not yet DHL and reach out to them. Complementary technologies will always interest your prospects because it creates a chance to facilitate processes. Especially if they currently work with a competitor that doesn’t allow for the integration of two major technologies they have invested in. Understanding technology spend Checking the types of technologies installed on a site can give you a great idea of what they spend on technology to estimate potential budget. Usually, if a company is using an enterprise-grade content management system, it’s possible they have a relatively high technology budget. As an example, if you’re selling B2B software in the mid-six or seven figures, you’d like to see if your prospects are using tools such as the Adobe Marketing Cloud. Knowing this software is priced at the premium end of the market, you can imagine their technology budget would be suitable for a product like yours as well. B2B Sales Automation Using Technographics Another way you can use technographics is to improve your qualification processes for better sales automation. Just like you might want to use industry, web traffic, company size, and other qualification metrics, technographics data can be added to this list as well. Adding technographics data to your qualification process will enable you to create a more effective pitch that actually resonates with your prospects, and easily decide who you should be investing your time and efforts on. This will bring your automation process to a new and improved level. In Summary Technographics data is a powerful site technology tool that will help you discover, qualify and build your pipeline. Using it will streamline your automation processes, and help you create better pitches, reach higher engagement rates, as well as get to know your prospects better.
