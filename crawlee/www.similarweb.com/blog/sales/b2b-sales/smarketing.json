March 30, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Let’s face it: we’re living in a time of hypercompetitive business. If you’ve not got a direct competitor, you’ve got multiple semi-competitors that do elements of what you do. How’s a company meant to level up to stand out? …and instead of giving you time to think about it – we’re gonna tell you. Sales and marketing alignment. Four words, two departments, one goal. 🤝 This alignment has become essential for organizations looking to drive growth and stay ahead of the competition. The process of aligning these two teams can lead to improved lead generation, increased revenue growth, and better customer experiences. In this post, we’ll explore what sales and marketing alignment is, why it benefits you, and how you can put smarketing* in action for ultimate success. *We absolutely will not accept anything negative you have to say about this phrase. What is smarketing (sales and marketing alignment)? Sales and marketing alignment – or smarketing – is a super important aspect of any successful business strategy. It refers to the coordination and collaboration between your sales and marketing teams to achieve common goals and adjectives. It means sharing goals, strategies, and tactics across both departments, along with any data, insights, and feedback to help refine those strategies and tactics. Basically, share everything. Ev-uh-ree-thing. Sales and marketing alignment is all about breaking down silos and creating a unified approach to customer engagement. Because to level up, scale, and win big, you need a shared understanding of customer needs and preferences – along with a willingness to work together towards common goals. And once you read the benefits of this alignment, that willingness will come pretty easy. 👇 The benefits of sales and marketing alignment If you’re wondering how to know if your sales and marketing is aligned, you’ll be seeing these benefits already. If you know you don’t have a smarketing (ha, got you again) alignment at all, then you’ll have these to look forward to. 1) Better communication Communication is essential when it comes to any alignment. If you’re working on how your sales and marketing teams work together, communication plans will be a huge factor because, well… it’s how you communicate? Seeing as comms are a big aspect in both marketing and sales roles, you guys should be pretty good at it. 2) Increased revenue Teamwork makes the dream work, and sales and marketing clubbing together is no exception. It can encourage more effective lead generation and lead nurturing, because you’re both targeting the same audience and persona, so know how they work. This magical collaboration helps marketing develop stronger campaigns that target the right audience with the right messaging, and make it easier for sales to follow up on leads more efficiently and on-brand. 3) Improved customer experience At the end of the day, it’s the customer that’s spending their money, so customer experience is a really important aspect of closing a deal, but also retention and referrals (if that’s your bag). And one thing that improves customer experience and satisfaction is consistency. There should be no part of the sales journey that feels jarring to your prospect. The transition from marketing efforts into the hands of sales should be smooth sailing, and marketing and sales alignment will help with that. 4) Stronger insights and analytics Yes, the alignment between sales and marketing means two teams, one goal, but you know what else is pretty good? Two great teams who have worked, and continue to work on data, analytics, and reporting. Data sharing gives you a more complete view of the customer journey, helping to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent when looking at data in silos. Not only do you have past insights which can influence or inform your combined efforts, but more sophisticated analytics can be developed to take both departments into account too. For example, by analyzing data on customer engagement and conversion rates, sales and marketing teams can identify the most effective channels and tactics for reaching different customer segments. ☝️ Name a more iconic duo… We’ll wait. How to do it: Sales and marketing alignment best practices So, how do marketing and sales work together to achieve ultimate business success? Here is a step-by-step guide: Step 1: Define common goals and metrics Both your sales and marketing teams need to work together to identify the common goals they can work towards. This includes goals like: Increasing brand awareness Generating leads Improving lead quality Shortening sales cycles Increasing revenue If you’re shooting in the opposite directions, there’s going to be issues with your pipeline and moving prospects through the sales funnel. Besides, if you’re both aiming for the same goals, you’ll get there faster. 💪 Step 2: Establish your target audience Developing detailed buyer personas will make sure you’re in sync with who the heck you’re aiming yourself at or talking to. To sell well, you need to understand who your ideal customers are. With this insight, your messaging can be far more targeted and relevant, improving its overall effectiveness. Hello, bump up in engagement rate. Step 3: Work on clear communication As we said, communication is absolutely key to marketing and sales alignment. Without it, things would just be kinda quiet and very not-aligned. Establishing regular communication channels between the two teams will help ensure that both teams are aware of what the other is doing. This can be as simple as a sales-won channel on Slack, or a content hub. Regular meetings, shared dashboards, and shout-outs will help to keep everyone on the same page. Step 4: Create a shared understanding of the customer journey Whether you’ve worked together before or not, both teams have their own insights. Here’s where Team Smarketing combines their knowledge and data to create a shared understanding of what the customer journey actually looks like. This will inform and strengthen both your marketing and sales strategies. That’s right – move over Barack and Michelle Obama, there’s a new power couple in town. Step 5: Implement shared technology tools If your comms and understanding are in line, your next step is to get how you work in line too. From lead generation through to tracking and reporting, there are a bunch of tools you can use. And when you’re two separate teams, that can mean even more tools – some of them doing the same thing. Start by establishing a single source of truth – ensure that the systems that overlap and are used to measure success are shared between marketing and sales and both orgs are looking at the same picture. Here are a few examples: Your CRM system (database of customer and prospect information) Your BI (business intelligence) system used to track campaigns and deal Your lead scoring system Your market research and target market analysis If you are syncing on these, it will make your sales and marketing efforts a lot more streamlined – and easier as a result. Step 6: Provide joint training and development opportunities for both teams Joint training and development opportunities will help sales and marketing teams to improve their skills and knowledge generally, but also in terms of each other’s roles, responsibilities, and perspectives. Any training collateral will prove particularly useful when onboarding new hires, but also when members of the team need a little refresh or want to check on consistency. This kind of training is also where you can work on all the previous steps, to make sure they’re optimized and working best for you and your business. “Alexa, play When 2 Become 1 by The Spice Girls” That’s it, that’s how you combine your sales and marketing team to level up and achieve your business goals, hopes and dreams. ✨ With Similarweb, you can have a single suite to ensure your teams are operating on the same data and assumptions.
