Create a killer sales plan that will transform that deck full of goals and targets into tangible results, but also help understand your sales team’s performance all-round. Sounds like a must-have, doesn’t it? That’s why we’re going to cover everything you need to know about building an effective sales plan, as well as help you out with strategic sales plan examples and templates to help you get started. So then, let’s go. What is a sales plan? A sales plan is what outlines your sales team’s objectives and targets, as well as the steps, budget, and tools needed to get you there. It includes specific revenue goals, information on your ideal customer profile (ICP), the chosen sales tactics, possible obstacles, threats, and necessary resources. Creating a robust sales plan is really handy to anyone that works in sales. It helps everyone see the big picture, get aligned on goals, and understand their role in achieving them. When you take the time to craft a sales plan, you will: Create a clear and accessible reference to understand company and sales-specific goals. Give your team the strategic direction it needs throughout every stage of the sales funnel. Provide guidance to sales leadership and outside the sales department, too. Build a foundation upon which to monitor progress and performance. How to make a sales plan An ideal sales plan consists of 13 key components: Company mission Goals and revenue targets Review of past performance Market and industry analysis Positioning ICP Team Budget Prospecting strategy Inbound marketing strategy Sales tactics Tech stack Performance metrics Let’s dive deeper into each of these components so you’ll understand exactly how to make a sales plan. 1) Company mission What are we all doing here? If your sales team can’t answer this question, don’t expect to get too far. Before anyone starts selling anything, it’s important for each team member to understand the company’s mission, purpose, and vision. Why did the founders build the company? What exactly does your product or service do? What value does it provide customers? How does your company impact industry, society, or the world? Taking the time to answer these questions helps your sales leadership, reps, and account managers start to see the bigger picture, which is essential for bringing your sales strategy to life. 2) Market and industry analysis This is the part where you research the major trends, challenges, pain points, and opportunities in your market. If your company serves businesses across different industries, you’ll need to conduct this research for each and every one of them. Having a deep understanding of your market and where it’s heading is crucial for holding meaningful conversations with prospects and providing real value. You can do this using the Competitive Landscape view on Similarweb Sales Intelligence, but if you fancy it, you can venture over to our friend, Similarweb Research Intelligence to get even more detailed competitor and industry analysis. 3) Review of past performance Reviewing your sales team’s past performance can be incredibly valuable while building a sales plan. This is where you can gain a clearer understanding of what factors led your team to positive vibes (✨) and what contributed to not-so-positive vibes. Once you’ve narrowed down what works and what doesn’t, you can apply these insights to your future sales strategy. Looking into past performance might highlight specific techniques that saw a big boost in revenue one quarter, or things like a sales manager leaving had a big impact on a team’s performance because they were key to the onboarding process. These discoveries can – and should – impact your forward planning to make sure your next quarter is as good as can be. 4) Goal setting Your sales goals will take the form of revenue goals and volume goals. For example, you might set a total target revenue goal of $15 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). But you will might want to consider breaking down your targets in a number of ways, including: By product (eg. a particular product or service doing better than another) By region (eg. your North America region routinely performs better than your EMEA) By quarter (eg. your company closes the most deals in the fourth quarter, and the least in the first quarter) By individual reps (eg. highly experienced reps vs. reps that are new and being onboarded) By taking these factors into consideration, you will be able apply ambitious yet achievable goals and targets for your team. Another thing to consider: volume goals. You might aim to sign 80 new customers a year, but are you thinking about the size of the opportunities? For example, you might sign 30 Fortune 500 logos in that number. Breaking into new markets or shifting from medium-large-size companies to enterprise companies is just another example of the type of goals that should be closely tied to your overall business objectives. One of the most important things to remember when setting goals is to make them realistic. If it is simply not possible to hit your targets with the budget, human capital, and marketing resources you have access to, you are setting yourself up for failure. 5) Ideal customer profiles (ICP) Next up: it’s time to review your ideal customer profile (ICP). You should have a clearly defined ICP in your sales strategy. Why? Because your ICP is all about who would make the best long-term customer. You can build this by looking at your current customer base, and seeing what characteristics make up your best performing or most loyal customers. Most ICPs are made up of demographic characteristics, including: Industry Company size Region However, these traits are broad and could easily produce a large list of prospects, including some companies that aren’t actually a good fit to your ICP. With a Sales Intelligence solution like Similarweb, you can enrich your prospects list with granular digital performance metrics, such as: Volume of sales per region Monthly/annual revenue Current tech stack Current partnerships (eg. existing in your CRM) With our unique traffic and engagement data, Similarweb empowers sales teams with full digital visibility into every part of a prospect’s digital strategy and performance. This added information helps you weed out irrelevant prospects so you can focus on just the best potential customers – and win them. 6) Positioning Positioning your company is all about determining how to best situate it within the current context of the market. This can be called market mapping, where you ask yourself questions like: Who are your competitors? How does your product or service compare? What are your relative strengths and weaknesses? What is your competitors’ pricing and what is yours? You’ll also want to focus on the technology trends or regulatory changes that impact the market as a whole, such as the rising popularity of a certain technology or the emergence of a new data privacy law. How will these factors impact your business and your competitors? 7) Team It might seem obvious, but going over your team can get overlooked in the sales planning process. When looking at your team and its dynamic, you’ll want to ask yourself the following questions: What is the desired headcount? Which positions do we need to fill or eliminate? What is each rep, sales manager, or AE’s responsibility? Do we have a process in place for ramping up new hires? Do we have good sales mentors? How can we keep everyone aligned? Despite the fact that sales involves lots of individual work, it’s a team sport at the end of the day. Sales success depends on effective training, sharing best practices, solid leadership, coaching, and accountability. So, go get it, team. 8) Budget Your budget is going to need to stretch across all costs associated with reaching your sales goals, which usually includes: Human capital costs, such as salaries and commissions Sales training programs Sales technologies and tools Contest prizes and incentives Travel costs Conference exhibition costs The more detailed your budget is, the easier it will be to make your case and get the spend your department needs. 9) Prospecting strategy Sales prospecting is the process of identifying potential customers who fit your ICP with the goal of adding them to your sales funnel. Once you’ve got your list of relevant prospects and added them to the CRM, your next step is establishing a relationship and nurturing them until they are ready to become paying customers. Prospecting is integral to an effective sales plan because it helps to make sure reps are going after the right kind of customers – and not wasting company time (or money) chasing the wrong ones. If you’re prospecting manually, you’ll find that it’s a pretty time-consuming sales activity. In short: it’s no one’s favorite task. But with a robust prospecting tool, it makes your life a lot easier. With Similarweb’s Sales Intelligence tool, you can quickly build a list of prospects who are ready to buy your product. Similarweb’s database includes more than 100 million websites and offers more than 50 digital criteria, to make sure you’re filtering out the misfits and leaving yourself with a list of good fits. Our insights generator tool will also help you learn and understand more about the prospect’s market, and gain key insights on how your company can help grow their business, giving your sales pitch the edge you need to seal the deal. 10) Inbound marketing strategy For this bit of the sales plan, you’ll need to collaborate with marketing to ensure you’re aligned on core objectives, business strategy, and target audience. If you’re not on the same page about these things, each department could be spending time and money focusing on clashing target audiences. If you want to bring in high-quality leads, marketing and sales need to work together closely. 11) Sales tactics Sales tactics are the actions you take to bring your sales strategy to life. When putting together your sales plan, you’ll want to dedicate some time to determine which tactics will help you achieve your goals most effectively. Here are some of the sales tactics we always recommend: Truly listen and focus on solving problems Stay true to your word and follow through Rely on data to drive prospecting and boost outreach efforts Review your conversations with prospects Check out our post on 10 sales tactics that will help you crush your quota for more! 12) Tech stack At this point – now you’ve outlined all of your goals and needs – you’ll want to consider which tools your sales team needs to get the job done. Your tool or tech stack should include things like: Customer relationship management (CRM) Sales Intelligence Prospecting and lead enrichment Analytics and reporting Process and training Meeting scheduling and recording 13) Performance metrics The last piece of the puzzle is tracking and measuring your success, and seeing whether you met your goals. Sales metrics and KPIs can vary company to company, but we’ve got a list of the 8 sales metrics you need to be tracking. Once you know which metrics to assess, you’ll want to come up with a system for monitoring them. This should cover the platforms you’ll use to perform these analyses, how often you will measure them, and how you report the outcomes.

There are lots of existing sales plan examples out there that you can use and adapt to your needs. Here are four strategic sales plan examples you can customize to bring your sales strategy to life (without the overwhelm). 1) 30-60-90-day sales plan This sales plan example is used to help sales organizations stay on track towards achieving their goals. The idea is to set milestones for the 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day mark, so you can monitor progress within a given time period. This type of plan works especially well for revenue-related goals, growing the volume of sales, or reducing customer churn. Additionally, new sales reps often use a 30-60-90-day sales plan to track their individual progress while ramping up. 2) Market expansion sales plan A market expansion sales plan provides direction when your business is expanding into a new industry or territory. Bonus: it’s a list of tasks and relevant metrics to help set you up for success. For example, if you’re expanding into a new territory, some tasks to check off could include: Increasing headcount Preparing training for new reps Researching regional markets and competition Determining accurate revenue and volume goals While some metrics will just tell you whether or not you completed the task (such as, did you create additional training material that focuses on your new territory? Yes or no), others will require quantitative benchmarks (such as revenue-related goals). 3) New product sales plan This sales plan example is perfect for when you’re preparing to launch a new product or service line. When you create a new product sales plan, the goal is to generate revenue from the new product. Therefore, the plan provides steps and guidance for incorporating the new product into your sales processes and pitch. To get it right, you’ll want to: Perform competitive analysis ✅ Determine how the new product impacts your brand and market position ✅ Work with product marketing on the pitch ✅ Identify which prospects and customers the new product will be relevant to ✅ 4) Business development sales plan With a business development sales plan, you can focus on using connections and building relationships to attract new potential customers. So on this kind of plan, your activities will be things like networking, sponsoring events, attending industry conferences, and performing cold outreach. But like any sales plan, you’ll also need to determine which KPIs are most relevant. One example: you’re an exhibitor at a large industry conference. Your KPIs might center on the number of badges your scan, number of meetings set, and number of follow-up meetings requested. Or, when it comes to outreach, you’ll track how many prospects responded to you, scheduled meetings, and meet your qualification standards to measure your success. Here’s another place that Similarweb Sales Intelligence comes in. It’s a tool that will make outreach a breeze. With the Insights Generator function, you can automate the task of finding relevant and compelling “insight nuggets” to include in sales emails. By mentioning specific stats related to their business or their competitors, you are sure to pique their attention. Top sales plan templates Another way to simplify the process of building a sales plan is to make the most of sales plan templates. A “fill-in-the-blank” structure makes everything a little less complicated, right? However, if you do choose to use a sales plan template, you’ve got to invest time and energy into customizing it to the very last detail so it’s totally relevant to your sales team. Try these *customizable* templates out for size: 1) Hubspot sales plan template Hubspot’s free template includes questions and steps to cover the following sections: Company History & Mission Team Structure Target Market Tools and Software Positioning Marketing Strategy Prospecting Strategy Action Plan Goals Budget With guiding questions in each section, it can help you clearly articulate all of the necessary information you have to offer. 2) Leadfeeder’s B2B sales plan template Leadfeeder’s template is designed to help B2B companies produce an actionable sales plan that you can put to use straight away. It includes: Dedicated space to add your objectives and KPIs in a visual and structured way Sales projections for the quarter with all necessary calculations to hit your revenue goals Pipeline dashboard with deal size According to Leadfeeder, their sales plan template is best for B2B companies that have a product that requires demos, meetings, and runs through multiple decision makers. Noted. 3) Asana sales plan template Asana’s template takes a project management approach to sales planning by visualizing all of the tasks in your sales plan as a checklist. This approach helps you assign tasks to certain individuals, as well as set deadlines. One of the benefits of Asana’s sales plan template is that it accounts for dependencies, so no crucial task can go (accidentally) unseen. One way they do this? Your colleague won’t be able to check off the “draft buyer personas” task until you’ve completed and ticked “perform market research”. Creating a sales plan doesn’t need to be hard Having a sales plan is all well and good, but having an efficient sales plan is essential to your success. Like we said, sure, it can be overwhelming, but tons of great salespeople before you have done the legwork for you. Today, you have plenty of strategic sales plan examples, sales plan templates, and sales tools to help get you going.
