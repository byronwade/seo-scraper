September 16, 2020 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Scoring great sales leads is a game of quality versus quantity. The objective is to find the right leads for your business that matches your target persona and audience. The best way to make sure your sales reps are securing the most qualified leads is through a process called lead enrichment. What is lead enrichment? Simply put, lead enrichment gives you access to additional points of information about your lead, also known as data points. Lead enrichment services are tools and processes used to enhance data on a particular lead or a target account. It helps you investigate whether or not a particular lead belongs to your target audience and demographic, and tells you if a lead is worthy to pursue. A high-quality lead is one made up of numerous data points such as company size, audience demographics, location, competition that fit your ideal customer persona. Here are some more data points that lead enrichment tools to give access to: Demographics: lead’s name, phone number, email, job role Firmographics: company location, size, company’s industry, company software usage Lead behavior: size visits, email marketing engagement A study by Netprospex found that 88% of over 60 million CRM records lacked basic firmographic data. Lead enrichment allows you to investigate your leads’ important demographic and firmographic information. From there, you’ll be able to reach out to your qualified leads with a more informed understanding of their company and their needs. “I have enough leads, I don’t need lead enrichment services” Treating a sales call like a blind date, without doing your research prior, is setting yourself up for failure. While you may have loads of leads, if you’re not using lead enrichment tools, chances are, your leads aren’t all completely qualified. This means that your sales reps will waste their time reaching out to the wrong people. Additionally, if you aren’t doing lead enrichment, you are going to be less ready for your sales call. Lead enrichment equips you with insights that will prove to the prospect that you’ve done your homework and understand their pain points, which will help you win the sale. How can lead enrichment benefit your sales pipeline? A sales pipeline is an organized, visual mapping tool used to represent the customer journey, and how they progress through the different stages of the purchasing process. The sales pipeline is a tool used to understand where your money and sales efforts are at all times, which is really helpful when juggling multiple sales prospects. Below is an illustration of the general sales pipeline, but just keep in mind that they can vary: Once you have defined the stages of your own sales pipeline, as well as your ideal customer/persona, the next step is searching for and then reaching out to your prospects, which happens right at the beginning of your pipeline (seen in yellow above). In an ideal situation, your inbound marketing efforts have paid off and you have lots of leads to work with. The truth is, however, that only about 10% of leads typically convert into customers. How can you possibly know which leads are worth going after? This is where lead enrichment is super handy, you’ll have access to information that will help sort your leads into qualified and unqualified. This means that sales reps will spend less time figuring out if a lead is a right fit for your company, and more time pushing your qualified leads through your enhanced sales pipeline. Using data enrichment to tailor your pitch Another way that lead enrichment benefits your sales pipeline is that it allows you to categorize your leads and deliver tailored pitches. Your prospects are tired of receiving cold-calls or emails. But, with lead enrichment, you’ll be able to tailor your call to meet your leads’ specific needs and interests. If you receive enough information about your lead through lead enrichment tools, you can even turn your initial call into a no-strings-attached free consultation, based on the pain points you discovered through your lead enrichment efforts beforehand.
