They help all us marketers and salespeople understand the important stuff, like: Exactly who they need to target How to communicate with them What will drive them to convert When developed carefully, buyer personas empower you to execute targeted and meaningful inbound marketing and sales outreach strategies that resonate with the right audience.

Buyer Persona Template Create strong buyer personas for your brand Download now What’s inside a B2B buyer persona? A B2B buyer persona is a fictional representation of an individual prospect who works within a company that you determine would make the ideal customer. It represents the “type” of person you want to target – based on traits like role, decision-making authority, and need. A well-defined B2B buyer persona includes: Demographic and firmographic information Role and job responsibilities Educational background Goals, challenges, and pain points Some of your buyer personas will have the authority to make purchasing decisions, while others will be “influencers.” No, not the ‘an-Instagram-selfie-a-day ’type of influencer – but the potential users of your product, or their managers, who could have influence on the final decision to buy your product. It’s important to understand the individual attributes of both types of personas so you can tailor your marketing and outreach in a way that will resonate with them on an individual basis and drive action. Having well-defined buyer personas serves as an effective prospecting tool because it makes it easier to understand which leads to reach out to. Gaining a deep understanding of who your users and buyers are can also help guide the development of your product or service so your offering caters to all your customer needs. Some buyer persona templates for you to try Every company has different needs when it comes to developing buyer personas. The two buyer persona templates we’ve outlined below require slightly different types of information.While they differ in specifics, both provide a clear picture of who your ideal prospect is and how to appeal to them. 1) The *traditional* buyer persona template This buyer persona template used in the first two examples below includes all of the standard information fields of a traditional template. It helps you understand your persona’s main responsibilities, goals, and challenges at work, looking at factors like: Name Role Age Education Career history Responsibilities Priorities KPIs Goals Challenges/pain points Personality/social behaviors Content preferences 2) The *solution-oriented* buyer persona template This template, shown in the third example below, covers the same demographic and work identifiers as the traditional template, but includes additional fields on how your company can directly serve the persona. It also includes a section to jot down any concerns that should be considered when dealing with this persona. Knowing your target audience’s ‘non-professional’ information will help you create a marketing strategy that resonates with them. Think about where they consume content, the types of content they like (podcasts, blogs, videos, etc), and who they are as people, not just their professional title. Name Gender Age Role Career path Family Location Income Communication preferences Goals Challenges How we solve their challenges How we provide ROI Potential obstacles to conversion 3 B2B buyer persona examples We’ve said it once and we’ll say it again: every company is different. Even competitors within the same industry define their ICP (ideal customer profile) according to different criteria. That’s why, when developing your sales strategy, it’s important to take the time to develop your own unique set of B2B buyer personas. We wouldn’t recommend just copying and pasting from pre-written B2B buyer persona examples – that won’t allow you to understand the unique attributes of your ideal prospects. But viewing a variety of B2B buyer persona examples is helpful for understanding what a comprehensive persona looks like for different kinds of prospects. Consulting some examples can help spark ideas when performing your own research, and help you develop unique personas that best represent the individuals you want to target. Once you have a clear picture of the individuals you will be targeting, it will be far easier to develop relevant and impactful lead nurturing material. Here are three detailed examples to start with: Example 1: CIO Imagine you’re a SaaS company that sells a software solution to enterprise companies. Because (a) your product is very expensive, (b) there’s a long sales funnel, and (c) it requires large-scale integrations, your top B2B buyer persona is the CIO. Here’s a B2B buyer persona example for a CIO: Name Julia Berger Role CIO Age 35-54 Education Bachelor’s degree in computer science, software engineering, information systems, or a related field Master’s degree in business administration or information technology Career history Held a variety of IT roles, including managerial/leadership roles. Previously held an executive role, such as a VP position Responsibilities Manages IT staff Develops departmental goals Oversees the IT budget Plans, deploys, and maintains IT systems and operations Keeps a pulse on the organization’s software needs Develops IT policies, procedures, and best practices Oversees relationships with software vendors and contractors Communicates with the CEO and board of directors on the benefits and risks of new IT-related projects Stays current on the latest industry issues and trends Priorities Cybersecurity Data integration and management Strategic alignment Staffing KPIs IT operational metrics: System uptime, system downtime, maintenance events, and maintenance costs Cybersecurity metrics: Rate of incidents, mitigation response time, average cost per incident Customer service metrics: Customer satisfaction rates, volume of support calls, technical support response time Goals Lead digital transformation Ensure strategic alignment between company vision and technological capabilities Prevent cybersecurity incidents Maximize use of company data Challenges/pain points Legacy infrastructure Widening talent gaps Cybersecurity and data protection Personality/social behaviors Professional Analytical Soft-spoken Content preferences Articles Videos Emails Whitepapers Example 2: Knowledge worker Now imagine you’re a company that sells a project management platform to all kinds of companies. Although a department leader or VP will ultimately be the one to sign off on a deal, one of your key personas is the potential user your platform would serve. He or she is an influencer who could appeal to their bosses to adopt this software. Here’s a B2B buyer persona example of a knowledge worker: Name Ben Smith Role Content marketing writer Age 25-35 Education Bachelor’s degree in communications, journalism, or marketing Career history 0-5 years of experience in a content writing role Responsibilities Write and edit blog posts, eBooks, whitepapers, webinar scripts, ad copy, and social media posts Monitor content performance Perform content optimization Priorities Producing content that supports the overall marketing strategy and vision Supporting brand awareness Generating new leads KPIs Lead generation: Number of new leads attributed to content User engagement: Metrics related to user retention and engagement with content across channels Individual productivity: Ability to complete assigned tasks on time and maximize outputs Goals Optimizing individual performance across KPIs Becoming promoted to team lead and eventually head of demand gen Challenges/pain points Balancing workload Managing communication with numerous internal stakeholders Differentiating content from competition Personality/social behaviors Detail-oriented Communicative Digitally-savvy Content preferences Social media Email Blog posts Videos Example 3: VP of Customer Experience For our last B2B buyer persona example, imagine your company provides a data integration platform that gives companies a 360-degree view of their customers. This is a sophisticated solution that can be integrated with hundreds of apps in order to collect all relevant customer data. Your ideal persona is the most senior leader overseeing customer experience: Family Married with two children Name Sara Cohen Gender Female Age 35-45 Role VP of Customer Experience Career path Experience in customer success roles 5-10 years in managerial roles Location Lives in the suburbs Commutes to the office three days a week, works remotely two days Income $100,000-$180,000 Preferred methods of communication and content Email, Slack, phone calls LinkedIn, blog posts, videos Goals Create a differentiated customer experience across an omnichannel environment Keep pace with consumers’ rising standards Challenges Embedding a CX culture and customer-first mindset across the organization Developing a deep understanding of customer segments Prioritizing CX initiatives throughout the business How we solve their challenges Offer a complete, holistic view of customers Deliver a full account of customer history and behavior on-demand How we provide ROI Our integration service provides invaluable data on their customers that can be used to improve CX initiatives across the board Potential obstacles to conversion High cost of the solution Convincing organization that integration is secure and non-disruptive Strengthening your B2B buyer persona process To create a successful B2B buyer persona, the details you include must be grounded in reality.
