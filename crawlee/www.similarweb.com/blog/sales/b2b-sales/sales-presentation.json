You might consider yourself a natural presenter, and love slaving over PowerPoint, thriving on every moment of the experience. Others? Dread it like a trip to the dentist. Luckily building and delivering an effective and truly great sales presentation is something that can be taught. In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to smash your next sales presentation. From must-have slides to sales presentation tips and examples, you’ll find out all it takes to captivate your prospects and close deals. Let’s start with the basics: What is a sales presentation? At its simplest, a sales presentation is a collection of slides that tells a story through visual elements and text. Teamed with a salesperson’s narration (either in person or via video), its aim is to convey a product or service’s value proposition, and ultimately convert potential clients into paying customers. A successful sales presentation will resonate with your prospect – linking in with their current needs and challenges, and positioning your company as the ideal solution. Here’s a great structure for one: Knowing this formula will put you ahead of some of the competition, but how do you make sure you beat them all? What slides make up a good sales presentation? 1) The cover slide Too many reps make the mistake of creating a generic cover slide for their sales deck. Our view? This is a big waste of valuable real estate. Come on, this is where you make your first impression. You want to reel your prospect IN. Whilst it might not be a clincher on its own, it can start to get across your main point: the value of your product. Let’s go with an example. Pretend for a moment that your company is called Projector and it sells project management software to enterprise companies. If your prospect is Acme Corp, consider how compelling the following text sounds: You’ve immediately suggested some of the benefits and value your software offers before you’ve even reached the first “real” slide of your PowerPoint presentation. So, now you have your prospect’s attention. Nice work – now it’s time to build on that. 2) The context slide The context slide: where you set the stage with information on the trends and pressure points that are spurring change in your prospect’s market. It’s all about setting your prospect up, hinting at the pain points you’ll touch on next. Build tension, and in turn, interest. Your context slide might include the following snippets: Work is becoming increasingly remote and dispersed. Collaboration occurs across countries and continents. As the pace of work increases and competition rises, slowing down is not an option if you want to succeed. 3) The problem slides Next, you’ll want to dedicate a few slides of your sales presentation to covering the problem, or a key pain point. You’ll need more than one slide to do this because problems – especially big, business-critical ones – are complex and interconnected. What’s more, prospects don’t always see the full range or depth of the problems they’re experiencing – it’s all too easy to get wrapped up in the day-to-day, isn’t it? According to the principle of loss aversion, people will work twice as hard to avoid loss as they will to gain a benefit. So, by painting a clear picture of the problems your prospect faces (and will continue to face in the future), you can motivate them to seek a solution. Example time: Let’s examine this through the lens of our fictional company, Projector. Sure, your prospect knows they don’t currently have dedicated project management software. They might know it’s difficult for their teams and departments to keep tabs on work or communicate on progress, but have they considered anything like: How this impacts productivity How many hours their team loses every week, month, and year due to low productivity Connecting the dots between low productivity and less revenue How needless meetings and excessive communication apps can actually make things worse You get the idea. 4. The “enviable future” slide Cool, so you’ve hit them where it hurts (their pain points), the next step is to portray how it could be if the problem no longer existed. For example, your slide might ask: From there, provide solutions to prove this is actually possible. Something like this… Projector enables: Centralized communication to eliminate unnecessary video calls, email threads, and text messages A visual way to monitor progress and identify bottlenecks, so nothing slows you down A single source of truth for all of your resources and deliverables, so you never need to go searching for the latest version Customizable workflows to meet the needs of any project The secret is to instill a true sense of longing for all of these benefits. This can help secure the ultimate buying decision. 5) The bridge slide Next up in your sales pitch is the bridge slide. This slide provides the path to a problem-less world, and how your solution can get them there. The bridge slide is a great opportunity to include the first touch of social proof, because people (and businesses) often copy how others behave – especially if they see proof of positive results. In sales, it means demonstrating that someone relevant to your prospect (like a close competitor or a category leader they respect) has gotten real value from your solution. The implication is that: Your prospect could too If they don’t, they’ll be missing out on a real competitive advantage This comes to life through a customer quote, stat, full case study, or all of the above on how a customer improved a business metric while using your solution. For example: Then you’ll want to include a statement that invites the prospect to get in on this success too. See what we did there? 6) The solution slides Like the problem slides, you’ll want to include more than one slide dedicated to describing the solution in your sales presentation. The first of your solution slides should give a brief, clear explanation of what your product or service does. This likely won’t be the first time your prospect is hearing about your offering, so there’s no need to cover every single detail. Try to boil down your product or service – as it relates to your prospect’s unique needs – into one to three clear sentences, and include a few visuals of your product in action where you can. The next of the solution slides should focus on the value your offering will bring to the prospect. Make sure your value proposition ties directly back to the “enviable future” you previously outlined, so it’s clear your offering is the key. Once again, social proof – like testimonials and customer stories with results from clients – can really lift these slides and grab your prospects attention. “Projector helped my team cut back on 70% of emails and eliminated the need for weekly team sync meetings. Now everyone’s status and progress is clearly visible to the whole team on Projector’s platform.” Or: “With full visibility into our marketing campaign budgets, we can quickly reallocate spend and optimize our campaigns. This quarter alone, we’ve increased inbound leads by 200%!” Those are some pretty compelling stats (even if it is a fictitious company). 7) The closing slide You’ll want to end your deck on a short slide with a powerful statement that helps ignite a sense of urgency in your prospect. Maybe something like: Or: Like we said before, visuals of your solution’s success will always make an impact; a nice little upward trending graph or a video testimonial of a loyal customer, perhaps. If your final slide touches on both the emotional impact of resolving the pain point and the potential business gains, you’ve hit the mark. Not only will your prospect want to stop losing out on productivity, revenue, or whatever else they’re losing, they’ll want to reap the benefits of your great offering. (And they’ll want to do it now, before their competitors eclipse them completely.) Powerful sales presentation templates to learn from Explanations are good, and fictional decks are nice, but we all know learning by example is the best way to gain new skills. You can find examples of sales presentation decks and PowerPoint templates scattered all over the web, but below we’ve sorted the wheat from the chaff just for you. Get ready to borrow from the best: 21 incredible sales deck examples guaranteed to get buy-in 9 incredible sales presentation examples that succeed 10 best sales presentation to inspire your sales deck 6 sales presentation tips to help you crush your pitch After you’ve crafted your narrative, built your slide deck, and got your design looking slick, it’s time to practice delivery. The way you deliver your sales pitch is key to your prospect’s engagement, understanding, and their interest in continuing the process. Here are six tips to help you communicate best. 1) Don’t talk for too long There’s no specific winning length for a sales presentation, but data suggest that keeping under 10 minutes is smart. According to a study from Gong (which analyzed 121,828 web-based sales meetings), successful presentations in intro meetings lasted on average 9.1 minutes. The unsuccessful presentation? 11.4 minutes. This mirrors neuroscience research which found that human attention begins to wander when a listener hears a single voice for 10 minutes. It’s actually why Apple doesn’t let its keynote presentations run for more than 10 minutes without introducing a change (like a switch to video, a demo, or just a new speaker). 2) Rely on data and insights Now, we might be biased, but this one is really important. ☝️ If you want to drive a business decision, you need to prove there’s a problem, and what the impact of the solution would be – all using real numbers. A sprinkle of competitor analysis, a measure of revenue forecasting (if they close a deal with you), and a dash of ‘what could be’ goodness is the magic recipe. If you’re able to confidently recall some persuasive, meaningful figures and drop them in where relevant, you could be in for the win. 3) Clearly illustrate the problems The challenges you’re describing might be big, messy, and complex. But your sales presentation and pitch needs to be concise and digestible. Don’t overload slides with text. Choose the most relevant information and illustrate it in a logical, clear way. When crafting your problem slides and thinking about how to deliver the information, keep the following pointers in mind: Use numbers and data to back it up: As mentioned, data is key. Connect each main problem to tangible losses, like revenue, human capital costs, customer churn, etc. Focus on the strongest (most painful) points: Your goal is to distill a web of problems into a few core examples. Paint a telling picture: Think charts, graphs, stats, and images. 4) Personalize it Even the most pixel-perfect PowerPoint presentation won’t get you anywhere if it looks like you’re just going through the motions. What we mean is: your sales presentation needs to feel like it’s been specially crafted with them in mind – even if you know the majority of it stays the same from week to week. Dropping in meaningful insights about their business is a great way to do this. These could relate to their own performance in the marketplace, to their competitors’ performance, or to an opportunity you’ve spotted for them. Ideally you’ll be telling them something about their business that they don’t already know, and guess what? Your product can help them to exploit, navigate, or overcome it. A tool like Similarweb Sales Intelligence can generate attention-grabbing and compelling data like that. It helps to inform any sales conversation you have, thanks to traffic and engagement data on over 100 million companies worldwide. The Sales Intelligence Insights Generator allows you and your sales team to automatically find “insight nuggets” to either include on slides or incorporate into your dialogue. This is the secret to a consultative selling approach, which we won’t shut up about (and for good reason). With an effortless way to source the freshest data tailored to your specific audience, building and delivering a successful sales presentation can become your most powerful selling strategy yet. 5) Welcome interruptions It’s easy to get fixated on landing your key points while presenting. So fixated, in fact, that you don’t give your prospect a chance to get a word in. Encourage your prospect to speak up with questions or comments throughout the presentation. Make this clear at the start, and keep an eye out for any hints through body language that suggests a question or observation is brewing. A sales presentation that feels more like a dialogue will be far more effective and memorable. Here’s why: ️ People like to talk: When you give your prospects a chance to get their two cents in, you’ll make them happy – and will help them to remember the conversation more fondly. ✍️ You can learn along the way: If your prospect says something super interesting and relevant, you can use that information to tailor and refine your presentation on the fly (and maybe use it in your next pitch). ⚡ It helps keep their mind engaged: As mentioned, when people take turns speaking, their brains automatically reset – and that makes it easier to have longer conversations, instead of listening to one long monologue. What’s more, interruptions also help relieve you of some of the pressure of talking non-stop. Win-win. 6) Be confident If you typically hate delivering a sales pitch, then you might be rolling your eyes at this tip. We know it can be hard to just ‘become confident’ if that’s not how you really feel. But there are things you can do that really will boost your confidence, helping you deliver a better presentation: Prepare: Get to know your slide deck back to front, memorizing all the numbers and stats you need to highlight. Practice your script: But also anticipate where questions or comments might come up. Listen to successful presentations: Make the most of your company’s recording software or find successful pitches on YouTube, and try to analyze what made these meetings, pitches, or persuasive presentations succeed. Make sure you’re super-familiar with your product: If you don’t fully understand your product, you’ll have a hard time getting someone else to. Practice presenting to a colleague to identify the holes in your own understanding as you speak. FAQs How do you do a sales presentation? Two good tips are to keep it short and tell a story. What should a sales presentation include? Include an introduction and presentation of the problem or pain point, before getting to the solution (hint hint, your product). by Josh Rod Senior Solution Marketing Manager, Similarweb Josh has a strong background in marketing for Israeli SaaS companies and believes in using humor and wit in his strategies.
