August 8, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Your sales pitch is one of the most important parts of closing that deal with your potential customer. Sure, it can take some practice and fine-tuning to make it land right, but there are some crucial elements you need in every new adaptation. To help you land those deals, we’re giving you seven successful sales pitch examples along with their key tactics highlighted. Notebooks at the ready, team – you’re about to find out everything that the perfect sales pitch should include. ✏️ Example #1: Keep it clear and simple Don’t assume everyone knows as much as you do about your product, its components, its benefits, the solutions it provides for, or even the industry you’re in. Because – realistically – they won’t. As Einstein once said, “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough” – and if you don’t understand it, how are your buyers supposed to? Without clear and simple language in your sales pitch or presentation, you will struggle to jump over that all-important first hurdle: your audience’s understanding of what you can *actually* do for them. This will have a negative effect on your pitch, and make your product seem far more complex than it should be. This barrier can exist, no matter how much older than you they might be… Exhibit A: Our first killer example of a sales pitch – 10 year old Cassidy absolutely owning her sales pitch to the Sharks in Shark Tank. (She even taught them all a new word). Example #2: Know your priorities Make sure you’re spending your precious time and energy (as well as your company’s time and money ) on the right kind of people that fit with your business. Start by working on your ideal customer profile (ICP), and make sure your prospects fit accordingly. Because if your prospect isn’t a fit for your product, or your product isn’t a fit for your prospect, that’s time wasted. Time you could have spent crushing that quota. Similarweb Sales Intelligence is the solution you need. Not only can you use it to generate a list of ideal leads using its array of clever filters, you can also get all the leads’ contact details in just one click. Prospecting, but superspeed. But don’t let strict priorities get the better of you, like Anushka and James in a recent episode of Dragon’s Den. Knowing that Steven Bartlett is a dog-lover, they came in with their eyes set on him… and only him. Their business idea of POP+BARK Pug Cafe went down a (dog) treat, but greed got the better of the couple, seeing not only another Dragon pulling out because of their tunnel vision on Steven, but Steven pulling out too. Example #3: Confidence is crucial If you don’t believe in your product, yourself, or your brand – who will? Admittedly, the example below was hit and miss at some points, with the Dragons actually covering their eyes at this salesperson’s persistence – but Peter Jones loved it. Alex and his leather bag pitch impressed him so much that he just knew he was a man he wanted to partner with. Confidence is in the eye of the beholder; it can be a personality trait or, even better, it can be thorough preparation. Preparing yourself for different responses, including different objections, can be what wins back prospects that are on the fence, and sometimes even the ones that are already over the other side. Example #4: Be personable Be careful with that confidence though – too much and you can quickly lose your buyer’s interest. Being personable is an important trait – and skill – of sales teams, because who is selling you a product is part of the package. As a salesperson, you are representing the brand, as well as being someone they may deal with time and time again. We’re not saying you have to go with the singing and serenading like Levi did below, but see how he intrigued the Dragons so much that they wanted to know anything and everything about the entrepreneur standing in front of them. He talks about food and family: two things that a lot of people can very much get on board with. And that makes for one of the best sales pitches examples to come out of Dragon’s Den. Example #5: Data and numbers are powerful You’ve heard it before, and you’ll almost definitely hear it again: Do your research . That includes predictions for the future, too – that’s what your prospects and investors are interested in after all. This pitch was grounded by hard data and numbers, and you can really see the benefits of pulling as much data together ahead of time as possible, can’t you? Think about your product, its benefits to your prospect, but also the competitors you’re up against. Pssst, here’s why a competitor slide can really kick some . Example #6: Solve relatable problems Tap into emotions by making your sales pitch as relatable as possible – whether to them as the buyers, or to their customers. This might come down to focusing on a widely-experienced problem, or a more specific pain point you’ve discovered during your research of the prospect and prospective company. Data and numbers about your target company can feed into this nicely. But how do you get your hands on other company’s data and their shortcomings in order to provide a very relatable solution? Ahem… Similarweb Sales Intelligence. More on that later. Meanwhile, take a look at Scrub Daddy as a solution to a problem we’ve all experienced. Example #7: Practice what you preach Last but not least: don’t offer something you can’t deliver or fulfill. This will impact your retention and how people view your brand, as well as affecting your own belief in your product (circling back to the confidence tactic we mentioned at first). When you don’t believe in your product, this will shine through in your pitches which will end with far more objections than you want. You want that perfect balance of confidence and honesty; they work hand-in-hand to help you win big. Flashback to Fyre Festival, who clearly didn’t get the memo… Fyre Festival Pitch Deck by NickBilton Examples to live your pitch by So, what do you get when you mix all six examples and their tactics together? The base of a very good sales pitch, that’s what. A sprinkle of confidence, a dollop of trustworthiness, a scoop of simple language, and a large helping of invaluable data all help to make a very edible (and almost irresistible) pitch for your prospects. All you need for that killer sales pitch is the right team for the job, consistent training to make sure they’re always up to scratch, the tools to find the right prospects, and the data to engage them.
