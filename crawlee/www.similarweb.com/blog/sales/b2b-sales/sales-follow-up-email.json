August 16, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic There’s an art to perfecting your sales follow-up email, with potentially hours going into crafting the perfect message, A/B testing different templates, adhering to best practices, and trying out new tactics. There’s a good reason why you and your colleagues should care about getting that sales follow-up email. They serve an essential function in the sales process, helping to keep up the momentum in between calls. A little nudge for your prospect to move down the funnel, and next stop: a paying customer. However, all of that is only true if your prospects actually open and read your emails. Unfortunately, the average open rate for sales emails is at a slightly sad-looking 17%. That means 83% of sales emails are getting ignored. And that’s exactly why writing a sales follow-up email (that actually generates a response) is one of sales reps’ biggest challenges. In this post, we’ll cover everything you need to know to write an email that your prospects will actually open, read, and reply to. That’s right, all the best tips, tricks, and templates for sales follow-up emails are coming your way. 8 tips for writing the best follow-up emails for sales When it comes to writing sales follow-up emails, a few simple tweaks can make a big difference in the eyes of your prospect. Check out these eight tips for writing the best follow-up emails for sales. 1) Keep it short Consider this: If you wouldn’t sit down to read it, don’t send it. Keep those sales follow-up emails as short as possible. According to HubSpot, which analyzed 40 million emails, the optimal length of a sales email is between 50 and 125 words. Boiling down your message into a short, concise message is no easy feat, and it might need practice, multiple drafts, and ample pruning. But hey, if you want your prospects to actually read and reply, it’s necessary. 2) Make replying simple By providing quick response options, you’ll encourage your email recipients to reply now instead of later, because you’ve made the act of responding so fast and convenient for them. Imagine the goal of your sales follow-up email is to touch base after a demo. Instead of requesting that the recipient gets back to you soon, you can offer them a series of quick-reply options. I know you’re busy, so no need to write a full message back. Feel free to reply with just a number, and I’ll know how to take it from there: 1 = I want to move forward and talk details. Let’s schedule another conversation. 2 = I’m interested in your product, but not at this time. Email me in six months. 3 = After seeing your demo, I don’t think your product is for us. 3) Cadence is key The best sales follow-up emails don’t just say the right things – they also arrive at the right time. Here is a rough guide for when to follow up with prospects in general: Send a follow-up email within 24 hours: After a meeting and you need to confirm next steps When you’re thanking the prospect for something Wait at least 48 hours: If you want to follow up on an email that they didn’t answer You provided them with materials and they didn’t confirm receipt You’ve agreed to schedule a next call, but they haven’t yet confirmed a time Wait at least three weeks: If you’ve sent them five emails with no reply There’s a thin line between being persistent and being spammy. By sticking to the recommended cadence above, you can boost your chances of staying at the top of prospects’ inboxes (and hopefully, minds) without bugging them. 4) Acknowledge that sometimes you’re a little annoying In a world where we are all flooded with ads and marketing content, it’s understandable why sometimes emails from salespeople can be seen as annoying or pushy. It’s okay to acknowledge that your follow-ups might come off as a little bit relentless. Hi [Name], I hate to be that annoying sales guy, but I don’t want to move on without hearing from you because my messages might have gotten buried in your inbox. A comment like this is sure to ease any tension that might exist (and probably reduce the number of screenshots of your email shared around on Slack for being “that guy”). 5) Offer real value Sales follow-up emails are amazing opportunities to provide content, information, or data that offers real value to your prospects. After all, if you want to convince your prospects to convert, you’ll need to prove that you have something valuable to offer. Imagine that during your intro call with a prospect, they mentioned that one of their biggest challenges today is providing a distinctive customer experience. This would be your opportunity to offer real value. When you write a follow-up email to thank them for the call, send along your company’s latest eBook or webinar on how to improve the customer experience. You can also provide real value in the form of: Information on the prospect’s top competitors Data on the adoption of new technology or trends in their market Connections with analysts, consultants, or other experts that can offer advice Articles, podcasts, blog posts, or other content that touches on topics you previously discussed The best follow-up emails in sales take advantage of every opportunity to provide value and support. 6) Make it about them To make sure you come across as genuinely motivated to help your prospect succeed, use language that focuses on the prospect more than yourself. The easiest way to do this is to say “you” and “your” more than “I” and “mine.” The words you choose can make a powerful impact on how your intentions are perceived. By putting the prospect at the center of everything, you will automatically seem more authentic and genuine. 7) Use social proof One of the best ways to prove your product or service will benefit your prospect is by providing examples of how it’s already helped other companies. Plugging some case studies, quotes, or testimonials into your sales follow-up emails can work wonders. Imagine your company sells customer support software. Here, you could include a case study in one of your follow-up emails that shows how a customer of yours was able to improve their customer support rating by 70% after implementing your software. They also were able to respond to 50% more customers, and customer support staff reported they felt twice as productive at work. With compelling figures and testimonials like these, you can generate stronger motivation and belief in your prospect that they need your product as well. 8) Break up when it’s over If a prospect consistently ignores your emails, it may be time to press pause on following up with them and instead direct your efforts at more tenable leads. But breaking up with a prospect doesn’t mean completely disappearing. Keep ghosting in the world of dating, please. Instead, it’s always worth sending one final “goodbye” email so you end on a good note. And sometimes, when it becomes clear you’re done chasing the prospect, they will decide they’re ready to talk. Subject lines: The first step to a good follow-up email for sales The modern employee receives 120 new emails every single day. They are flooded with mail from colleagues, managers, calendar reminders, newsletter subscriptions, and lots of spam — not to mention emails from the sales reps you’re competing with. Here are some examples of effective sales follow-up email subject lines for five different use cases: 1) After the intro call Following up after an intro call is standard practice. But since prospects expect this email, they may think they already know what’s inside and don’t need to open it. Here’s where a compelling subject line saves the day, again. Objectives: Thank them for their time Schedule another meeting Send them an article, podcast, or report they might find interesting Subject line examples: Thanks for your time! Here’s the agenda for our next call Here’s the information I promised you Our next steps + interesting podcast you’ll love 2) After a trigger event A trigger event is a great reason to send a sales follow-up email, and could motivate a usually unresponsive lead to reply. Common examples of trigger events include: The prospect was promoted or changed jobs Their company named a new executive Their company announced a strategic partnership, merger, or acquisition Their company is relocating Their company just posted a particularly good (or bad) quarter Their industry is undergoing a major change or trend Their company just won an award Objectives: Remind the prospect that you’re still here Foster a sense of urgency around the deal Give the prospect a chance to talk (especially if the trigger event is their promotion or another personal experience) Subject line examples: Congrats on [your promotion]! Question about [your new partnership] X thoughts on [industry trend] 3) After a review with decision makers Sometimes your prospect will be responsible for all the comms with you, but still need permission from a superior before signing a contract. When multiple stakeholders are involved, deals can quickly get dragged out. Let’s look at what you can put in a follow-up email for sales, to help push things along. Objectives: Remind them to talk to their superiors Understand how you will move forward Subject line examples: Let’s talk about next steps Time to touch base this week? Meeting invite: [date] 4) When they don’t answer If a prospect hasn’t answered your last couple of emails, you’ll want to try reaching out once more with the hope of getting their attention. Objectives Put the ball back in their court Create intrigue Subject line examples: [Name], I miss you! Exciting update for you! Thought you’d be interested in this 5) The breakup If your prospect has effectively ghosted you, it’s time to gracefully say goodbye. Objectives: Let them know you won’t be reaching out any more Invite them to get in touch in the future One last effort in getting them to respond Subject line examples: Permission to close your file? I won’t be bugging you anymore My door is always open Top sales follow-up email templates So, we’ve got sales follow-up email tips and we’ve got subject lines. But what about the content itself?.

I’m still interested, just super busy these days. Check back in a few months.
