In fact, we’re the only solution to provide comprehensive traffic and engagement data on millions of companies. These kinds of insights give you a full understanding of potential new business opportunities – stuff like whether they’re growing or declining, how engaged their audience is, what channels they’re active on, and so on. In other words, our platform makes sure you’ve got your eyes set on the right opps. Say goodbye to wasting precious time. The Lead Generator tool allows you to customize a ton of parameters (including more than 50 web metrics), to produce a hyper-relevant list of prospects that would bring in high revenue or strategic value to your book of business. It even provides decision-makers’ phone numbers and email addresses, saving you a job and making it easy to jumpstart outreach. On top of that, we integrate with Salesforce and HubSpot CRMs, making the process as seamless as possible. Another advantage of Similarweb Sales Intelligence is the Insights Generator tool. This allows sales reps and marketers to effortlessly uncover prospects’ challenges, then create tailored marketing content and outreach messages that your prospects will actually want to know about, grabbing their attention.

What is the implementation and onboarding period like? Do we have the necessary skills to maximize the software? Does the vendor provide onboarding support? Does the platform integrate with our existing sales and marketing tech stack? Will the platform create any technology redundancies? What is the potential ROI? How long will it take to see this value?
