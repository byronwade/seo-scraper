September 4, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic The global tech industry is estimated to reach $9.2 trillion by the end of 2023. T r i l l i o n. In fact, the US tech industry alone is worth $1.8 trillion, and it took up 35% of the total world tech market at the end of 2022. Big numbers, right? Those numbers are only going to get bigger too. Tech companies include all digital electronics, software, any internet-related services, ecommerce sites, and so on — so we can almost guarantee that you’re fuelling those numbers yourself, and keeping a lot of them in business on a daily basis. Who are the big players in the world of tech? Well, you’ve probably heard of a few of them… Top 100 tech companies by website traffic We took the top 100 tech companies by revenue from Nasdaq, and put a little Similarweb twist on it: website traffic. As a taster, here are the top 25 top-earning tech companies, ranked by website traffic: Domain Monthly visits HQ country baidu.com 5,291,078,720 China yandex.ru 3,423,133,195 Russia amazon.com 2,572,143,607 United States netflix.com 1,541,103,922 United States samsung.com 1,251,527,859 South Korea microsoft.com 801,237,195 United States ebay.com 734,182,683 United States rakuten.co.jp 508,853,489 Japan spotify.com 495,218,808 Sweden paypal.com 469,476,301 United States apple.com 465,448,413 United States pinduoduo.com 291,173,379 China adobe.com 262,178,069 United States coupang.com 148,353,449 South Korea jd.com 122,351,094 China wayfair.com 121,843,995 United States intuit.com 120,906,901 United States airbnb.com 114,816,746 United States alibaba.com 88,110,263 China salesforce.com 85,195,846 United States adp.com 75,067,395 United States hp.com 62,906,885 United States uber.com 61,258,473 United States asus.com 50,070,446 Taiwan nintendo.com 44,886,201 Japan dell.com 44,772,374 United States Want the full 100? Download the list here: Now let’s take a deeper dive into the top 5 — which you’ve definitely heard of — using Similarweb Sales Intelligence. A deeper dive into the top 5 tech companies, by monthly visits 1) Baidu First, we’ve got a Chinese multinational technology company that specializes in internet-related products and artificial intelligence: Baidu. Baidu’s features and services are super similar to those of Google, but with a focus on China alone. Like Google, it controls most of the search market there. Let’s look at the insights (because that’s what we do best): Above, you’re looking at Baidu’s website performance for July 2023 alone, with over 5.2 billion website views and a deduplicated audience of 212.4 million. Big numbers, right? As we mentioned, Baidu is a platform that targets China as a location, so no surprises when we take a look at the traffic share by country… From Similarweb Sales Intelligence, we can tell that most of its traffic is direct traffic — which is unsurprising when you’re a country’s main search engine. But what we can see is that some of its traffic does come from organic search. Upon closer inspection, a lot of that organic traffic comes from the search engine, Bing. So, how about we look into the organic keywords that are leading users to Baidu’s website… actually, I might just screenshot these (you’ll understand why): 2) Yandex Non-Russian speakers might not have heard of this one, but like Baidu and Google, Yandex is a sort of… everything brand. The Russian multinational tech company offers a search engine, ecommerce services, maps and navigation, mobile apps, and digital advertising. Here’s an overview of yandex.ru’s traffic and engagement metrics from July 2023: And now for some insight into the website technologies Yandex is using behind the scenes: Advangelists: Advertising Outbrain: Content suggestions Conversant: Retargeting Salesforce: Customer relationship management 3) Amazon If you’ve followed our regularly updated posts on the top ecommerce companies in the US, UK, and the world, you might be thinking, “wow, she must really like writing about Amazon.” Well, here we go again: Amazon has come out on top. With dedicated websites in some 20 countries around the world, there’s a lot of data you can track. In July alone, Amazon.com saw 2.57 billion website visits, and on a yearly view, it saw 31.88 billion. Imagine adding up all the other countries’ data too. For that, you’d definitely need Sales Intelligence insights — Amazon’s got subdomains for days. So, what else can we tell you about Amazon.com? Well, a lot of things, but we’ll just give you a few examples. First up, how Amazon.com gets those mega traffic views: A few things of note here: Direct traffic trumps other marketing channels, which just shows how successfully Amazon has built its brand Organic traffic also not so bad here, suggesting it ranks well for what it offers Check out that desktop vs. mobile traffic split! But who are these people visiting Amazon? Let’s have a look at the site’s audience demographics: We even have access to the typical browsing habits of this audience, too — and it looks like Amazon is up there with some of the greats, including the greats for procrastination. You’re onto a winner if you’re being soaked up by procrastinators — it’s why YouTube and Facebook ads work so well. And here are a few of the website technologies that Amazon.com uses to round off our insights: Demdex: Advertising Marketo: Marketing automation Adobe Audience Manager: Data management platform Drawbridge: Publisher ad server BuzzSprout: Podcasts FreeWheel: Video ads 4) Netflix Next up for our biggest tech companies is a name that’s not shy of news headlines on the reg: Netflix. A brand you’ve most definitely used — or at least heard of. Whether you’ve got it downloaded on your TV, laptop, or phone, or if you’re mooching off a friend or family member’s account (that is, if you’re managing to work around their new account-sharing crackdown), Netflix is a big part of a lot of people’s lives. But admittedly, it’s had a lot more negative press of late. With their prices going up and stricter rules enforced for additional members on accounts, it’s seeing a bit of a slump in subscribers. And guess what? We can see that in our data. Check out this view of netflix.com traffic from July 2022 to July 2023: Is Netflix doing anything to combat this downtrend? Our insight into its marketing channels suggests not, with the majority of traffic coming direct (~87%), a little bit from organic (almost 11%), and the rest offering under 1% each. In fact, the brand has been doing nothing with its paid ads or display ads, despite that big dip in traffic. Is this the fall of Netflix? With numbers still as big as 1.54 billion visits for July 2023 alone, maybe not, but still — it’s certainly taken a turn. 5) Samsung Last but not least in line for the top five big dogs: Samsung. We spoke about Samsung recently in the world’s top ecommerce companies, so seeing them in the top five tech companies wasn’t a shock either. Here’s another company that has different websites for different countries, and here’s another time when we will use the US version as an example. Just because. So, Samsung.com — what can we tell you? For some perspective, Samsung.com got 1.25 billion website visits in July 2023. Here are the top 10 countries that these visits came from: Now, compare that with Samsung.co.uk traffic, where you’ve only got a few crossovers in the top ten: Samsung.com is clearly a more widely used site across the world, which you can see by the traffic share percentage in the second column from the left. Samsung.co.uk is — not surprisingly — mostly visited by users in the UK itself. If we take a look at visits over time, this is another site where we can easily point out when new releases have come out (and when some might be due…). But where on earth is Google? Okay, so it’s a little more complicated than that. You might notice that there are some big names toward the bottom of the list. You know, like that little thing called ‘Google’ — the company that owns it, Alphabet, is number 80 on the list. How about we cover that minor complication now? Let’s take a look at three companies where maybe the numbers don’t quite match up: 1) Alphabet Inc. (Google) First up, as we mentioned, there’s Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube. Shockingly (not), as the owner of a big name and key search engine around the world. it’s a winning tech company. But the thing is, the corporate website, Alphabet (abc.xyz) doesn’t get that much traffic itself — it relies on its brands for its revenue. That’s why it’s not higher up in that top 100 list. Google.com alone hit 1.11 trillion website visits from July 2022 to July 2023. That’s a lot of hits, isn’t it? You can see on the Website Performance page that even the deduplicated audience is 2.44 billion. Now, think about those kinds of numbers, plus the visits to each and every dedicated Google URL for different countries. The answer = a really, really big number of visits. And most of them are direct, too: No real surprises there, as Google is the leading search engine around the world — it dominates over 92% of the market. But here’s a thought: Despite being levels above the rest, who are Google’s main competitors as a search engine? Let’s look at the Competitive Landscape view in Similarweb Sales Intelligence. If we filter by search engines, here’s what we get: Here are some of the technologies used to give Google that extra boost: Prebid JS: Header bidding ProductsUp: Product data management system FedEx: Shipping NationBuilder: Website builder And many, many more (as you can imagine) 2) Foxconn A brand that has been — and will be — in the top spots for a long time is Foxconn, the electronics manufacturer. It’s part of Hon Hai Precision Industry Ltd, but trades as Foxconn internationally. Foxconn produces some iPhones, iPads, and Macs, and it has just been in the news — and thus, our Sales Signals feature — for launching production of the iPhone 15. So, what’s their website data saying? Let’s have a snoop at Foxconn.com over the past year. It seems like Foxconn’s back on the up-and-up, at least in terms of website traffic. And interestingly, the site’s visit duration is significantly above average at over 8 minutes: Just recently, Foxconn founder Terry Gou announced he’s running for President of Taiwan, and then resigned from the Foxconn Board of Directors. That might explain the uplift in traffic (and interest). 3) Apple And for the next big tech company, we want to talk about… Drumroll, please. Apple. You’ve for sure heard of this one — and maybe even got one of its products in your bag right now. Say hello to everything iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, Apple TV, plus all the accessories, entertainment, and expert support that comes with it. Apple is 11th on the list of our top tech company websites ranked by traffic. But in terms of revenue, it’s number one by a long shot. That’s because Apple’s revenue is split across online and in-store — you know, those huge, shiny Apple stores don’t exist for no reason. But digital insight is kinda our thing, so we’ll go into that for now. In July 2023, the site saw 465 million visits, which is up ever-so-slightly (0.83%) year-over-year. But if we take a look at the trends month to month, you can get an idea of where updates and new releases have happened. For example, that big spike in September 2022? The iPhone 14 lineup was released, along with the Airpod Pro 2. Like we said, you can almost guarantee you or the person next to you has a bit of Apple tech on them right now, and there’s a reason for that. Its tech is good; it performs well, it looks great, and it’s trusted all over the world. Just look at the countries the site gets visits from — and this is just the top ten: Go beyond the top 100 So, there you have it — the top 100, with a deeper dive into the top 5 to see what makes them just so good at what they do.
