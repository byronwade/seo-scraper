December 6, 2021 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Sales automation is dead. Well, thoughtless sales automation, anyway. Don’t get me wrong – ever since its inception, most of us have been big fans of the technology and what it can achieve. It streamlines the sales process and frees up our time. It helps us remember to follow up with people (even if we’d rather forget about some of them, some days). But if all the sales tools we’ve ever wanted are at our fingertips. And our competitors’ fingertips. And their partners’ fingertips. And your great-aunt-that-runs-an-ecommerce-store-for-cat-hats’ fingertips (you get the gist). Then it begs the question… Has the magic worn off? Let’s be honest – in this day and age we can all smell an auto-generated email a mile away. It doesn’t matter how seamlessly we insert those {companies}, those {job_titles} or even those {weather_talking_points}. Your auto-generated masterpiece can just end up looking like clever junk mail to your prospect. Which – depending on their frame of mind when they receive it – they might find even more annoying than dumb junk mail. Monogrammed spam is still spam, after all. Putting the “personal” back into personalization Good news is, you don’t have to throw your technology in the dumpster – and go back to the sales Stone Age – to make your outreach truly personal. Prospecting, we all know, is about finding the right person and reaching them with the right message. That message needs to be timely. Insightful. And above all, in this noisy world, attention-grabbing. Not easy. That’s why we built Similarweb Sales Intelligence.
