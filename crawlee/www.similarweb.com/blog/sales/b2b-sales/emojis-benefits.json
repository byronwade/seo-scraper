But that’s exactly where emojis come in. These little icons are everywhere these days, and for good reason. They’re quick, easy, fun, and super available over instant messaging and social media apps. But, did you know that emojis are also a great tool for businesses? From sales and marketing to internal communications, using emojis in the working world have its proven benefits. Let’s take a closer look at how emojis can help you better connect with your audience and boost your results. 7 benefits of using emojis in sales and marketing comms Reasons why you should start using emojis more in your business communications? We’ve got seven of them. 1) Spice things up Work emails and posts can be a bit samey, a bit monotonous, and quite frankly, a bit dull. If you’re looking for a little something-something to spice up your content when you’re short on time, creativity, or you just can’t be bothered, emojis are your answer. Have a bit of fun with it, but if you want to go for some sure winners, here are the top 6 most popular emojis used on LinkedIn: ☑️ ➡️ ✔️ We might be biased, but we think you can do better than that. Although… Top tip: Avoid any emojis that are NSFW – you’ll look like a total eggplant otherwise. 2) Increase your engagement That’s right. There are stats to prove that emojis boost engagement for both marketing and sales emails, as well as in social selling. But you don’t need to hear it from just us – let the numbers do the talking: The open rate of emails with emojis in the subject line is 56% higher compared to plain subject lines. Using emojis in the subject line can lead to an increase of unique click rate by a huge 28%. Using an emoji in a tweet can help increase engagement by 25%. Out of two paid ad variations, Sprout saw the one using emojis brought in 84% of clicks (meaning a lower cost per lead too). Push notifications that use emojis can get up to 85% more opens and 9% more conversions. On Facebook, emojis result in 57% more likes, 33% more comments, and 33% more shares. 3) Enhance your brand personality Emojis can help to humanize a brand, helping to showcase its personality and values. Plus, it can make your content more distinctive and memorable too. By choosing emojis that align with your brand’s tone, style, and maybe even brand colors, you can create a more cohesive and recognizable brand image. 4) Help with your tone of voice In real life when we talk to each other, body language counts for a lot. Consider emojis like your digital body language, helping you to convey emotion and tone in your messaging. Written content can be open to interpretation – it’s hard to know for sure when jokes are being made or if there’s an element of sarcasm. Throw in eyeballs and you can set that sarcastic tone straight. 5) Speak the universal language Particularly if you’re dealing with clients around the globe, you can latch onto the fact emojis have universal meanings. They can be understood by people of all cultures and backgrounds. Admittedly, sometimes we get it wrong though. Here are a couple of fun emoji facts for you: The emoji is not actually meant to represent praying (or similar) – it’s actually a high five. Only 7% of users actually use the peach emoji to represent the actual fruit. How cheeky. 6) Go in for some easy reading In a time when everyone is low on time or just plain impatient, creating skimmable content is the way forward. That’s where readability comes in. Think about how you can use emojis to improve or jazz up the layout of your posts, emails or other comms. Our personal favorite way to use emojis? Bullet points. 7) Save yourself on space And as our patience decreases, so does the official character count across social media platforms. That’s another benefit of emojis in marketing and sales right there. Like the old saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words” – and apparently, so are mini cartoon burgers, fries… and fried shrimp. Keep things short, snappy, and under that recommended character count for optimal engagement. Get your emoji on Conclusion: you love emojis, we love emojis, everyone loves emojis. But let’s lay down the ground rules here: Know your audience: Consider your target audience, their preferences, and their expectations. Read the room: It’s all about context. Is the crying loudly emoji really an appropriate response to a sales objection? (No, it’s not.) Use them in moderation: Like everything, if you overdo it, you’ll kill the vibe. Be mindful, and don’t let the novelty wear off. Test, track, adapt: If you’re not sure emojis are right for you and your audience, why don’t you get some A/B testing in place? Your post analytics will reveal all.
