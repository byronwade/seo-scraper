April 18, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic ChatGPT and other AI tools are taking the world by storm – or at least, your LinkedIn newsfeed anyway. Everyone seems to have a strong opinion on it. Is that helpful? Not exactly. But what would be helpful is an ultimate guide on how it can help you do your job. You know, like an ultimate guide on using ChatGPT for sales, perhaps. Tadah. As if by magic… it’s our ultimate guide to ChatGPT for sales. ✨ If you want specifics, check out our individual guides: How to Use ChatGPT as an SDR How to Use ChatGPT as an Account Executive How to Use ChatGPT for Account Management More to come… How to use ChatGPT in your sales strategy Some might say ChatGPT is out to get your job – the truth is, it’s not. However, it can do a good job of supporting you in your sales role and help improve your performance in it, whatever that sales role might be. Here’s a run-through of how ChatGPT can improve the sales performance of you and your team; from the SDR tasks of generating new leads and qualifying through to making sure your team is trained up nicely and hitting their targets. 1) Inbound sales If you’re an SDR, BDR or whatever you call yourself, chat.openai.com is a great source for initial product education, which is good when it comes to speeding up your lead qualification process. You can even take the inbound sales inquiry and put it in ChatGPT to get a quick idea of the sentiment behind it; whether they are understanding your product in the right way, being targeted correctly, or are a good fit for your ideal customer profile. This frees up sales reps to focus on the higher-value tasks like building relationships with qualified leads and looping in account executives to get those deals closed. Here’s an example, but you probably want to challenge the robot a little more than this: And yes, you absolutely can ask ChatGPT what rhymes with “farm”. 2) Outbound sales ChatGPT can also be used to help initiate conversations with prospects by gathering product details, industry trends, and other relevant information that might just reel them in. We’ve spoken a lot about cold calls and sales emails, and what the secret ingredient is to grab your prospects’ attention and get them engaged. The quick answer: keeping things relevant. Enough of the generic sales template, enough of the monotonous call scripts, enough of the salesplaining. Understand who your prospect really is, what their pain points are, and go beyond just selling your product with the most successful sales technique: consultative selling. Be an advisor to your prospect, and help get rid of that snakey salesperson stereotype. Our top tip? The more information you provide ChatGPT, the more it can help you. That’s why we think Similarweb and ChatGPT link up pretty nicely. Find the insights you know will get your prospects to bite, and ask ChatGPT how to present this information along with other relevant points. Top tip #2: Bullet points are not only good for those of you that zone out with loads of text, but also great to encourage that personalized touch that is oh-so-important to sales success. And that’s how you use ChatGPT for sales prospecting and outreach. Go work your magic, sales reps! 3) Account management That’s right, account managers – ChatGPT has got your back too. It’s a great source to help you provide ongoing support to existing customers in your client list, answer common questions that you see or hear a lot, and handle routine tasks like updating customer information. When you’re stuck for time, ChatGPT can even interpret sentiment behind messages too, and offer you ideas on how to handle those messages. Is it an upsell opportunity or is it interception time because the client is just not using your product right at all? If there’s potential for churn, what can you include in your outreach to swerve it? 4) Sales coaching and training Another big win for sales teams everywhere is that ChatGPT can be used to support sales reps, those being onboarded, or those that just need a refresher with real-time coaching and training. Whether you’re after a quick fix of definitions or more in-depth product knowledge, or you’re after direct feedback and more personalized training, ChatGPT can help. Yep, seriously – this clever little bot can offer ways for you to improve those sales calls of yours, recommend new sales techniques based on previous successful interactions, and suggest areas to improve, along with content to aid those improvements. It can be as simple as giving your problem, and asking for a solution. However, if you’ve got any specifications make those known. For example, if you’ve got a preferred method of learning – like reading, watching videos, or listening to podcasts – then include this in your prompts. 5) Sales analytics You can’t tell apart a successful sales process from a not-so-successful sales process without monitoring or tracking it. And you guessed it – ChatGPT can help you out there too. Please note: help. The tool can be used to analyze sales data (pretty quickly) and provide insights on sales performance. This includes identifying patterns in sales data and providing recommendations to improve sales strategies and tactics, thanks to its language processing capabilities. So, does it have the capacity to change the way you do business? Yes, for sure. Should you double-check everything to make sure it’s 1) what you asked for and 2) relevant to you or your clients? Please, for everyone’s sake. Your unfair sales advantage Grab your prospects' attention with insights from Similarweb Sales Intelligence Book a live demo 5 benefits of using ChatGPT for sales There are a bunch of benefits of using ChatGPT during your sales cycle, with one very big one which we are going to put first: 1) Time-saving In the busy world of sales, time-saving is a double-barrelled, dream adjective for any tool. By automating certain parts of your sales process, ChatGPT can save sales teams a significant amount of time. Speeding up routine tasks like lead qualification, answering common questions and providing product education (to name a few), the AI tool allows you more time to focus on what’s important – the stuff that us humans do the best: Building personal connections Understanding body language and human sentiment Adding those all-important personal touches Having a laugh or two You know, the tasks that require even the slightest emotional intelligence to be truly effective. ChatGPT trawls through a lot of information, impressively quickly and provides you with a nice summary in your format of choice. If you ask for a step-by-step guide, you’ll get a step-by-step guide. If you ask for bullet points, you’ll get bullet points. If you want a quick 100 word summary, you’ll get a quick 100 word summary. 2) Consistency While we just mugged ChatGPT right off for having no personality or emotion, this actually brings us to another benefit: it’s a very consistent tool. ChatGPT uses the same messaging and approach for all its answers, so you’ll always know where you stand. Much better than that girl off Hinge you went on three dates with. So, you and the rest of your team – plus anyone else that uses it – will have the same level of service. No teacher’s pets or favorites here. 3) Personalization As a tool that’s programmed to provide personalized recommendations and insights based on a prospect’s or customer’s specific needs or preferences, it’s great for personalization. Or, at least, the start of personalization. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: please don’t copy and paste from ChatGPT. Not if you really want to build relationships, nail that sales quota and keep customers on board. Sprinkle a bit of ‘you’ magic into the mix to build rapport and increase the likelihood of closing that deal. 4) 24/7 availability* *Apart from when it’s down. As a very new but also very popular platform, there are some teething issues. However, when you’ve got such a handy tool available (almost) all day and (almost) every day, it can really save you time and effort in your day-to-day tasks because, we all know, moving prospects through the sales pipeline is not always limited to your average 9-5. If you make yourself available to your clients, then the tools you use need to be available to you too. Top marks for customer experience and loyalty. 5) Scalability Again, depending on its capacity for the day, ChatGPT can handle a large volume of interactions at the same time. More than we can say, right? This can help you to handle more at the same time too, which is extra useful when businesses are trying to scale their sales efforts. You might be moving upmarket, or adopting a PLG motion, or you might just be trying to bring on more clients – whatever it is, ChatGPT allows you to have more free time to handle that business growth. 10 examples of ChatGPT prompts for sales As discussed, there are a few ways to best use ChatGPT for sales. Here are just a few examples of questions or prompts you can ask ChatGPT to help improve your sales process, and understand your client base and its challenges at a deeper level: What are some common pain points that prospects in [insert industry here] face? Can you act as a [insert job title here] of a [insert company size here] and tell me how to communicate best with you? How can I effectively address [insert pain points here] in my sales conversations? Can you provide me with some examples of successful sales pitches or approaches that have worked well for similar businesses in my industry, including [insert key competitor here]? How can I effectively use data and insights to tailor my sales approach to the specific needs and preferences of [insert target audience or buyer persona here]? Explain [insert niche or new industry topic here] like I’m a 5 year old. Explain [insert niche or new industry topic here] like you’re Mickey Mouse.* Can you provide me with some tips or best practices for building strong relationships with prospects and clients of [insert target job title or decision-maker here]? Please provide the above in bullet point form and send me a video recommendation on the same topic. How else can I effectively leverage AI technologies like ChatGPT, to improve my sales efficiency? *yes, really. In terms of ChatGPT best practices for salespeople like you, we’ve got a few of those too: Be clear and concise ️ Use natural language Use specific keywords Keep it conversational ♻️ Test and refine, if you need to Our biggest tip? The more detail, the better. You won’t regret it. The power of automation and human touch Admittedly, it’s not always hunky dory because as an AI language model, ChatGPT has some limitations. Namely: Lack of human touch and interaction: While it can provide personalized recommendations and insights based on a prospect’s needs, it cannot provide the same level of empathy and emotional connection that a human sales rep can. Limited flexibility (and a bit of confusion): It can be limited when it comes to complex or unexpected situations, down to its specific programming and algorithms, which can lead to a less-than-optimal customer experience. Language limitations and miscommunication: Incredibly, ChatGPT is capable of understanding and responding in multiple languages, but it doesn’t always understand regional dialects or nuanced language. Costs and budgets: Implementing and integrating ChatGPT can be costly, especially when it comes to small businesses with limited resources, which can outweigh its potential benefits. But hey, spoiler alert: where ChatGPT lacks, you step UP. The combination of automated process and human touch means you can sell smarter, not harder. By incorporating ChatGPT in your sales and marketing strategies, you’ll boost your productivity, engage with customers more effectively, stay ahead of your competition and generate more business.
