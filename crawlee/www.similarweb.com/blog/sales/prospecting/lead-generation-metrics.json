May 9, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic We talk about lead generation a lot, and your boss – and your boss’ boss, and your old boss’ boss’ boss – probably does too. And rightly so. It’s where the sales journey begins, and if you want the rest of the sales process to run smoothly (which you absolutely, most definitely do), you want to make sure you’re generating and qualifying leads effectively and not letting the wrong kind of leads through. Which is where lead generation metrics come into it. To know if you’re doing something effectively, you need to track. To know if you’re doing something wrong, you need to track. And to track, you need KPIs and metrics. So, a drum roll, please… 7 lead generation KPIs and metrics There are several metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that you want to be using to measure your – or your team’s – lead generation efforts. Here are a few examples, so you know which boxes you need to be ticking during your lead generation process: ✅ 1) Number of leads generated Name: Lead generation The aim: Generating leads The ultimate goal: Generate as many leads as possible Perhaps one of the more basic of the lead gen metrics out there, the number of leads generated helps you to determine whether you are meeting the required amount of leads to hit your quota and keep your business flowing nicely. So whilst it’s self-explanatory, it’s not one to be missed. 2) Conversion rate Conversion rate is a big metric for any sales role, and is definitely one of the main lead generation KPIs to track. This metric measures the percentage of leads that turn into actual sales. So, when you have a high conversion rate, it’s great news. This indicates that you’re doing a great job at lead nurture and closing deals. While a low conversion rate indicates some improvement needed in the sales process, or perhaps some more training in this specific area. 3) Average deal size Another one of the lead gen metrics that is perhaps self-explanatory, but considering it could take you to the next level as a salesperson. By working out the average value of each sale, it shows off your upsell skills or your ability to close larger deals… if you get a high average that is. With a low average, you might want to reassess your target audience – and maybe reevaluate – or simply refresh on – the company size and revenue in your ideal customer profile (ICP), for example. 4) Sales cycle length Then we’ve got the length of time that it takes to close a deal from the initial point of contact or outreach. A shorter sales cycle shows that you’re quick at moving leads through the sales process, and efficient in the way you work. A longer sales cycle doesn’t mean you’re necessarily bad at your job, but it means you are spending time on the wrong type of customers; prospects that aren’t right for your business or not ready to make a purchase. All that can be ironed out with an effective lead qualification process. 5) Lead response time Lead response time is the measurement of how long it takes for a salesperson to respond to a new lead. Ideally, you want to respond as fast as possible, and strike while the iron is hot. Here are some fun stats about lead response time to show just how effective being speedy is: 82% of consumers expect responses within 10 minutes. The optimal time to respond to a lead is within 5 minutes. Salespeople who respond to leads within an hour are 7x more likely to have a meaningful conversation with a decision-maker. But you guys are clearly doing alright, because 50% of email responses occur within 60 minutes. Here’s our handy little guide to sales emails (to actually get replies), but please, don’t forget there’s this thing called ‘picking up the phone’. 6) Customer acquisition cost (CAC) Get your calculators out, because customer acquisition cost (CAC) is all about adding up how much it costs acquiring a new customer, on average. If you want to look at this on an individual prospect basis, this metric is called cost per lead (CPL). This is an important sales lead generation KPI to keep as low as possible because you want your prospects and customers to provide a ROI for the company. Spending a lot of time trying to convert a low-paying client will mean the money (yes, that includes your effort and time in the form of salary) isn’t worth the end result. This should always be factored into your lead prioritization. 7) Customer lifetime value (CLV) Customer lifetime value – also known as CLV but also CLTV – measures the total value that a customer will bring to the business over their lifetime. If your pipeline is filled with high CLVs, you’re working your magic by identifying (and hopefully, closing) high-value customers. A pipeline full of low CLVs might mean another reassessment of your sales process and your target market, because they might end up costing a lot more than they’re worth to your business. The right lead gen KPIs for you When it comes to the best B2B lead generation KPIs and metrics for your sales team and business, there isn’t really a one-size-fits-all-solution. What you have, or what you choose will depend on what you’re selling, who you’re selling to, and your sales strategy. Here are some examples: If your product or solution is at a higher price point, you have more room to play with your customer acquisition cost because the ROI will (hopefully) be worth it. Or perhaps your solution is a one-time purchase or something that isn’t meant to be renewed. This will impact the CLV, and should be considered in your sales plan. If your ideal customer profile is based on smaller companies with smaller budgets, that average deal size isn’t really going to matter too much to you. What you do always need to remember is that it’s not the quantity of leads, it’s the quality of leads – and trust us, you’ll be everyone’s favorite if you don’t let that slip.
