Any salesperson can attest to the fact that having enough qualified prospects is a time consuming and manual process that doesn’t exactly scream ‘best part of the gig!’. But worry not, because we’re here to show how Similarweb can help make this process scalable, data-driven, and fast. In this blog post, we’ll explore 7 ways Similarweb can help your sales team generate more leads, and scale the process so you can spend more time actually doing what you love: spending your well-earned bonus money from all the targets you’ll reach. It’s time to master the 7 methods for creating more efficient lead generation. The beauty of Similarweb Sales Intelligence’s workspace is that you can actually combine the tools mentioned in order to generate leads that truly match your ideal prospect. #1 Visits and engagement: Sizing the opportunity When you’re searching for new eCommerce prospects, there are some easy “tells” that show you the size of the opportunity for your organization. Consider the number of visitors a site has received in the past month, how many of them came from mobile, and how many pages they visited. These key metrics can help you infer the size of a prospect’s business and their conversion rate, so you can decide how relevant a prospect they are and prioritize accordingly. The Similarweb Lead Generator allows you to set minimum and maximum amounts for monthly visits, unique monthly visitors, and total page views. Setting these parameters correctly will ensure you’re always finding the correct prospects (eg. 500K-5M unique visits for inside sales reps, while enterprise sales reps would set parameters for 5M and over). When looking at engagement, the Lead Generator allows you to set the level of bounce rate (are people interested?), average pages per visit, and average duration (how interested?). Let’s look at a simulated example of the type of company that would use this, and how they would set filters to find leads: Based on these criteria FDC will find 5,000 new prospects using the Similarweb Lead Generator. If you’re constantly looking for up-and-coming eCommerce websites to prospect, you can sign up here to receive updated lists of the ones experiencing the highest traffic growth. #2 Marketing channels and geography: Where does their traffic originate? Knowing the marketing channels a company is using, as well the country where the majority of the traffic originates from, allows you to understand whether there are marketing channels they are underperforming in and enables you to help them optimize. The Similarweb Lead Generator allows you to set the share of traffic they receive from specific marketing channels such as direct share, referrals share, social share, organic search share, paid search share and display ads share. This is critical information when you want to find prospects who might be interested in increasing their traffic from certain channels, such as referral or paid. In terms of geography, the Lead Generator allows you to set which country, or group of countries should be the main sources of website traffic. That way you can focus on finding the most relevant prospects for your territory. Let’s look at a simulated example of the type of company that would use this, and how they would set filters to find leads: Based on these criteria SMET will find over 9,000 new prospects using the Similarweb lead generator. #3 Growth filter: Find up-and-coming websites When prospecting, using growth filters can help you find the most relevant prospects for your strategy. Say you’d like to start working with eCommerce companies early on in their journey, you’d look for websites that have seen growth in traffic for the past few months, even if the amount of page views isn’t high. If there is a growing trend, then they’d be the perfect partner for you. Having a good understanding of what sites are experiencing growth will allow you to scale and have a larger pool of prospects that fit your solution and outreach strategy. To receive updated lists of the highest growing eCommerce sites every month, sign up here. The Similarweb Lead Generator allows you to set the metrics you want to see the change in (traffic, unique monthly visitors, page views, direct visits, and more), include the percentage of growth you want, and the time period in which they’ve experienced this growth. Let’s look at a simulated example of the type of company that would use this, and how they would set filters to find leads: Read more about how adding multiple payment options can increase conversions for eCommerce websites. Based on these criteria OPP will find over 4,000 new prospects using the Similarweb lead generator. #4 Technographics: See what technologies their website is built with Knowing the technologies a prospect has on their website can help you to do three things: (1) check for competitor technology on their website – this will allow you to pitch your own value in relation to them, (2) find complementary technology – can make it easy to explain the value of your offer and show them how they can facilitate processes, and (3) gage their technology spend. The Similarweb Lead Generator allows you to look for technologies installed on websites as well as find websites that have not installed a specific type of technology. Let’s look at a simulated example of the type of company that would use this, and how they would set filters to find leads: Based on these criteria BBC will find over 1,000 new prospects using the Similarweb Lead Generator. #5 Keywords: Laser focus your outreach Using keywords to find prospects allows you to really focus your efforts on the most relevant prospects. In simple terms, let’s say you sell eggs, you could generate leads using cake keywords because you know that anyone selling cakes is definitely buying eggs. The rest is up to you, how you pitch your offer and show value. Let’s look at a simulated example of the type of company that would use this, and how they would find leads: Read more about how adding buy-now-pay-later options can increase conversions for eCommerce websites. Using the Total Traffic tab in the Search Keyword Analysis page BNPLS will find over 50 new prospects. #6 Referring websites: Finding suitable partners Referral traffic is when someone comes to your domain through another site and not directly from Google or by clicking an ad. Many influencers work on referral traffic for eCommerce companies and send many new shoppers to their websites. Using this filter allows you to find websites that already invest in this marketing strategy, making it easy to showcase your value to your prospects. Let’s look at a simulated example of the type of company that would use this, and how they would find leads: Using the Referral Leaders tab in the Web Category Analysis page RTE will find 10,000 new prospects. #7 Display advertisers: Find prospects in categories that are relevant to you Display traffic is a common marketing strategy that allows eCommerce companies to target their audiences and lead them to their website. Finding prospects that are investing in display advertisement is a great way to prospect for new leads when that’s what you’re selling. You’ll be able to quickly find websites that already invest in this marketing strategy, making it easy to showcase your value and find relevant prospects. Let’s look at a simulated example of the type of company that would use this, and how they would find leads: Using the Display Leaders tab in the Web Category Analysis page DTM will find over 3,000 new prospects.
