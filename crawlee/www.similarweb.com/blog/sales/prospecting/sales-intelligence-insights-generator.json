April 11, 2021 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic On average, we receive 121 emails every workday and it takes eight attempts to reach a prospect. So as a salesperson, how do you send emails that cut through the noise, stand out, and grow your business? Insights. When you’ve researched and know your prospects better, it’s easier to reach them and convince them that you deserve their business. The challenge: the research. For sales teams across the world, crafting and sending emails is a balancing act between the quality and quantity of emails sent. Similarweb’s Insights Generator allows you to skip the manual work of researching for each individual email and enables you to pull actionable insights at scale. The Insights Generator allows you to find customized insights for any prospect or customer in seconds. Once you’ve pulled the insight, with just one click it’s ready to go for your next outreach email. Harness these insights to position yourself as an advisor to prospects and customers. With the Insights Generator, you’re able to find areas of improvement within your prospects’ or customers’ competitive landscape and take a more consultative approach with your sales. Start conversations with “here’s what I know about your business, and here’s how I can help,” rather than feature dumping, which the experts at Gong have labeled as the number one sales mistake. How it works Insights Generator can be found on Similarweb under Sales > Lead list > Company on List > Sidebar. Enter the sales workspace and select a list of leads that you have generated. Click a company on the list so the sidebar is expanded. The third tab is the Insights Generator tab. Based on your subscription package, you’ll be faced with a list of countries to search for the benchmarks and the websites that you would like to benchmark against. Finally, you can select the most relevant data and send them straight to your inbox. They will arrive in your email in the right format to be sent out to your prospect.
