August 11, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic If you’ve got access to the internet, then you’ll probably have heard of ChatGPT and how it can be used. If you’ve already seen our guide on ChatGPT for Sales, then you’ll definitely have heard of everyone’s new favorite robot and know what it can do for sales roles like yours. But what about ChatGPT for account managers specifically? In this blog, we cover exactly how to use ChatGPT as an account manager, and why you should be taking advantage of it as a tool… but not worrying about it taking your job. In it for a quick skim-read? We get it. Here are six areas where ChatGPT can help in account management: 🤝 Nurturing of key accounts 👂 Recognizing sentiment to prioritize accordingly 📚 Providing product information 💰 Upselling and cross-selling 👚 Tailoring responses and offers to fit your client 🧑‍🏫 Coaching for onboarding and refresher training ChatGPT for account management Whether you’re new to the game or you’ve been in the game a long time, you account managers will be well aware of the fun parts of your job… and the not-always-so-fun. Like any job, being an account manager comes with some challenging tasks and responsibilities. You’ve got to be available, reactive and patient. From doing the admin for multiple accounts to scheduling regular calls, and from making sure clients are using your product to its full potential to keeping that churn rate low, that’s pretty much all on you. So, wait – where does ChatGPT come into this? Well, it can speed up some of the boring and time-consuming bits with automation and quick responses, and help you work more efficiently as a result. Can it do (or take over) your job? Absolutely not. It allows you more time to focus on the more important, more fun, and more human bit. You pick up the slack where ChatGPT lacks: personality, emotion, banter, creativity and physical interaction. The good stuff. Anyway, here are some ways to leverage ChatGPT to your best advantage as an account manager: How to use ChatGPT as an account manager 1) Nurture client relationships Whilst ChatGPT can’t pick up on body language to aid your lead nurturing, it can help you with buyer behavior and other preferences through the art of stereotypes. Now, we don’t all love to be included in a stereotype, but you can’t go far wrong when it comes to business stereotypes. We know what you’re thinking – you’re “not like the others”, but to be honest, you probably are. Enter in specifics of your ideal customer profile and buyer persona, including job role, company size and context into what makes them your target audience. Then, ask questions around the stereotype: As an account manager and someone who works closely with accounts and develops strong professional relationships, you’ll learn more and more about your clients along the way. Don’t be the guy who thinks this information is the only thing that sets you apart from this AI robot and keep it to yourself though – instead, enter this information to fuel ChatGPT for more accurate (and still very quick) summaries and outputs. Here’s a basic example, but we know you can spice it up: It takes the target persona and the information you gave, and creates a series of tips that relays back to both points. Round of applause, please. 👏 2) Interpreting sentiment On top of understanding stereotypes, their behavior, and how they’d like your professional relationship to be, ChatGPT can help you quickly interpret sentiment behind client messages. Using its natural language processing techniques, ChatGPT can spot positive, negative or neutral sentiment, as well as identify any other specific emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, or frustration. Which is pretty good for a robot, isn’t it? You can even ask ChatGPT for insights and recommendations on how to best handle the interaction, including tips on improving the relationship with clients based on its analysis – a bit like this.👇 The ChatGPT checklist: ✅ Nails the sentiment behind the message. ✅ Reminds you not to jump on the upsell opportunity and appreciate the good feedback. ✅ Includes some sound SEO advice, using a consultative selling approach. ✅ Identifies the upsell opportunity and how to approach it. Nice work, ChatGPT. Value-based selling for the WIN. So, you’ve got the short-term benefits of helping you handle specific issues or queries reasonably quickly, as well as long-term benefits of understanding and managing your clients’ expectations, and prioritizing better as a result. You’re killin’ it. 3) Provide product information Okay, but first… Disclaimer: ChatGPT product knowledge is not always up to scratch – it says so itself: *A self-described 8/10 but with a few red flags, we’re taking it down to a basic 5/10. However, when you need some quick insight or a little reminder about your client’s business or industry, a clearer definition of a niche word, phrase or process, or even how to position your own product (including its features and add-ons) for all your different clients, ChatGPT is your guy. Remember, the responses you get from ChatGPT are only as good as its basic training, but also the information that you give it. This could include your client’s particular specifications, or your product’s use cases. You can start with the basics or go all in with everything you’ve got, and see how it goes. Don’t stop asking questions or directing the AI chat until you’ve got the kind of answer or result you’re looking for. Consider yourself the ChatGPT trainer now, and make it work to your advantage. 💪 4) Handle cross-sell and upsell opportunities Using its analytical skills, ChatGPT can take any customer data and interactions that you give it, and help identify any cross-sell or upsell opportunities. Like we said, ChatGPT’s product knowledge isn’t quite there, but in reality, you will always know your product with its cross-sell and upsell offerings better than an AI tool – likewise with your clients. But hey, a quick robotic round-up can help you on your way and point you in the right direction for a cross-sell or upsell. Again, you’ll make your life even easier if you fuel the tool with the information you have. Don’t skimp on the details because it’s only going to mean more work and more time wasted (which could be spent working on your customer relationship and experience). So, tools like Similarweb Sales Intelligence are gold when it comes to working with ChatGPT. The level up for reactive account managers like you? One of its most recent features: Sales Signals. Take the data and insights you discover from Similarweb (maybe even that super hot-off-the-press alert you got through Sales Signals), feed that into ChatGPT, work out your next sales move, boost your client’s experience of your product, and hit that sales quota. 🎯 5) Craft personalized responses and offers With all those insights and information you’re feeding it, ChatGPT can also come up with tailored responses for you to send to clients. On top of that, it can use the customer data to craft personalized offers so they can’t resist the upgrade or add-on features. How does it do this? Well, you can input information like: Purchase history Buyer behavior Preferences And whatever you think is interesting, really ChatGPT will take all this and suggest discounts and promotions that are relevant to the customer’s interests and past purchases, but also guide you on how to present these offerings in the most compelling way. 🏆 Before you go hitting copy and paste, make sure you carefully review and edit any responses generated by ChatGPT to not only make sure it’s all in order and factually correct, but to also sprinkle it with a bit of ‘you’. 6) Provide training and coaching The AI tool is also a great source for training materials and coaching for account managers. The internet is full of great advice on cross-selling and upselling techniques, best practices and strategies, and ChatGPT reels them all in so you can see them all on one screen. 🎣 If you have any questions or queries, or if you just want to understand a topic or tip in more depth, simply ask – and you shall receive! Wanna go one step further? ChatGPT can even provide feedback and insights into your performance as an account manager with the right kind of information. This can help highlight areas you need to improve and how to improve, and saves you waiting for your next 1/1 with your manager. Work smarter, not harder As we’ve already mentioned, ChatGPT and other AI tools aren’t here to steal your jobs. If you use it in the right way, it’s only going to make you better at your job, saving you time and letting you focus on the things that matter. You know, closing those upsell and cross-sell deals and keeping your clients sweet. 🍬 No one likes getting bogged down in boring stuff, so let ChatGPT do its thing by providing: Quick and (mostly) accurate responses to a wide range of inquiries Advice and recommendations of sales best practices Insights and industry trends for your clients Automation for routine tasks to help streamline your workflow By leveraging ChatGPT’s power, you can optimize your productivity, increase your effectiveness, and achieve your goals more efficiently. But what if there were even better tools out there? SAM has a brain We’re not sure if you realized, but we were making a vital point throughout this post that we really want to make sure you know: ChatGPT doesn’t have a brain – it gets information from wherever it can find it, and *you* can be one of those sources. In fact, as an account manager or a salesperson in general, you’re going to be one of its best sources for the more specific AI responses you’re looking for. You have all the knowledge, customer data and insights it needs to curate really detailed responses – you’ve just got to spoon-feed it. (ChatGPT, say “aaaah”). This is why Similarweb Sales AI Module (SAM) is your leg up in the game. With SAM, you can easily get AI insights on your prospects and even their competitors and instantly write an outreach email that combines that data with your unique value proposition. All you need to do is add a bit of personalization and send off that email! As you monitor your clients’ accounts, you hop over to their website. With the Similarweb Sales Extension, you notice some of their metrics have dipped, and there’s room for improvement. You navigate to SAM, which has sifted through their website and found insights, and BOOM 💥 you have an email drafted, bringing this to your client’s attention. But we’re not done just yet! You also share a few ideas of what could have caused this and how to fix it (of course, with your product). Did someone say win-win? You’ve just helped solve an issue your client didn’t even know existed (all without them spending more money), you’ve further established a strong relationship with them, and left them pretty happy.

ChatGPT is a large language model that uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to understand and respond to human language. It has been trained on a vast amount of text data and can generate human-like responses to a wide range of topics. How can I use ChatGPT as a sales account manager? ChatGPT can be used as a tool for generating new ideas and insights for sales strategies, researching potential customers and competitors, and providing personalized responses to customer inquiries. How accurate are ChatGPT’s responses for salespeople? ChatGPT’s responses can vary in accuracy depending on the input and the context of the conversation. While it can generate impressive responses that are hard to tell apart from those written by humans, it’s really important to remember that it is still a machine learning model and may not always provide the most accurate or appropriate responses. Always carefully review responses generated by ChatGPT before using them in any sales-related activities. by Leah Messenger Senior Content Marketing Manager Leah is a Senior Content Marketing Manager with a passion for turning complex topics into engaging, educational content.
