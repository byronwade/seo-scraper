(AKA The Holy Grail.) And one of the best ways to see if you’re on the right track is knowing how big a slice of the attention pie you’ve got. That, my friends, is traffic share in a nutshell. This is a comprehensive look into how to use traffic share data to boost your digital marketing strategies. We’ll also show you how to get yourself a bigger slice of that attention pie using Similarweb Digital Marketing Intelligence. Off we go. What is traffic share? A super straightforward way to define traffic share is the share of traffic that your website gets out of the total traffic in your industry. But there’s so much more nuance to it than that, so let’s go into a little more detail. When it comes to traffic share in the digital world, it’s not quite the honking, hustle and bustle of road traffic you join every day to get where you need to be. Or is it? In many ways, understanding traffic share is very similar to how a car on the road (an individual internet user), drives to places like restaurants and shops (different websites) in a busy city (your industry). So if every website is a shop or restaurant in the city, then the number of cars that drive to your particular shop compared to the total number of cars driving around = your traffic share. How to calculate traffic share Traffic share is calculated by dividing your website’s visitors by the total number of visitors to all sites in your sector, then multiplied by 100. Here are the formulas you can use to calculate traffic share for websites, marketing channels, and keywords: Website: Traffic to a specific website / Total traffic to the competitive set x 100 Marketing Channel: Traffic generated by a specific marketing channel / Total traffic to the site x 100 Keyword: Traffic generated by a specific keyword / Total search traffic to the site x 100 Why is traffic share important? What’s all the fuss about? Why should you care how big or small your percentage is? In general, understanding your traffic share is a great indicator of how popular your website is compared to others within your sector or industry. It’s a snapshot of your relative market position, and whether your SEO, content marketing, social media, and other digital strategies are drawing in the right crowd. Are you the front-runner, the underdog, or one of many smaller contenders? It goes without saying that the more popular your website, the more website visits, and sessions you receive, which in turn leads to more engagement, more conversions, more leads, more sales…. You get it. There’s more to it than gauging popularity, though. Here are just a few reasons why traffic share needs to be on your radar: 1) Spy on the competition Knowing your traffic share lets you sneak a peek into your competitors’ performance. If their slice of the pie is looking bigger than yours, it may be time to unleash your inner Sherlock Holmes and find out why with a competitive analysis tool. What are they doing differently? 2) Rethink your strategy Whatever you discover that other companies are doing better can help guide your digital marketing strategy back on track. It may be time to up your SEO game, rethink PPC ads, or mix things up with your content strategy. 3) Track the tides Watching your traffic share over time is crucial for analyzing your marketing efforts.

You’ll get the nitty-gritty on everything from share of traffic by device, to PPC vs organic and even regional distribution. Here’s a quick overview of some of the traffic share information available to you and how this data can boost your marketing strategies. Overall traffic share for a group of websites Looking at your overall traffic share gives you a high-level look into your industry’s competitive landscape. It shines a light on the websites and domains that are winning your audience’s attention. To look at your overall traffic share on Similarweb, head to the main Website Performance tab and enter up to five competitor websites you want to analyze. You can pick either the big players or a few new kids on the block, or a healthy mix of both, to get a picture of how website traffic is shared between you and them. Top Tip: Look at the traffic share overview as a benchmark for brilliance. Let it chart a path for what you need to be doing to compete with, and eventually, outperform the competition. Use the data to set some realistic KPIs and identify areas of improvement. Traffic share per marketing channel Eager to know which of your marketing channels is taking center stage? Similarweb’s Marketing Channel overview shows which channels, from organic search to social media, are in the spotlight and which are edging into the shadows. Depending on business models and audience preferences, ideal channel mixes vary from business to business. Similarweb shows you the industry average for each channel, so you can identify where you’re ahead, behind and where you might just be able to stand out. The example above shows the two biggest channels are direct and organic – this is the healthiest traffic share, as it shows SEO and brand awareness efforts are working. Device and location Dissecting traffic share data by things like device and region on Similarweb is like having a telescope that gives you a glimpse into very specific user behavior.
