See your competition by Monique Ellis , Content Marketing Manager 8 Min. August 28, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Imagine stepping into a lively marketplace where every stall is vying for attention, each one shouting, “Pick me! I’ve got the best deal!” That’s competitive intensity in a nutshell – everyone’s hustling to grow, stand out, and stay ahead of the pack in a market that’s as tough as it gets. For any business aiming to not just survive but thrive, understanding this competition is crucial. The better you grasp what your competitors are up to, the sharper your decisions will be. You’ll spot opportunities faster and dodge risks with ease. The numbers speak for themselves. Just look at the top players in the Nasdaq. In 2022, the ten largest companies spent a whopping $222 billion on R&D, constantly innovating to stay ahead of the game. And that number just keeps climbing every year. What is competitive intensity? Competitive intensity is all about how fiercely businesses are battling it out for market share, customer loyalty, and profit. Think of it as the heat level in your industry – how many competitors are in the ring, how fast the market is growing, and how unique the products are. Several factors turn up this competitive heat: The number of competitors How concentrated the industry is The rate of market growth Product uniqueness Barriers to entry Competitive intensity is a key concept in industry analysis and is often linked to Michael Porter’s Five Forces Framework from 1979. These five forces help paint a clear picture of just how intense the competition is in a market: In highly competitive intensity industries, companies are in a constant race to outdo each other. Take the tech industry, for example, where everyone’s scrambling to launch the “next big thing.” On the flip side, industries with low competitive intensity are often dominated by just a few big players, like utility companies, where the competition is much more relaxed. Understanding the competitive intensity in your industry gives you a heads-up on potential threats and a better shot at growth. It reveals the underlying dynamics, like trends in innovation and customer satisfaction. And when you apply Michael Porter’s Five Forces, you’ll gain even deeper insights into the competitive landscape across different industries. Understanding the competitive intensity in your industry gives you a heads-up on potential threats and a much better shot at growth. This is because it uncovers the underlying dynamics, like trends in innovation and customer satisfaction. And when you apply Michael Porter’s Five Forces, you’ll gain even deeper insights into the competitive landscape across different industries. The importance of being competitive in your market To succeed and stay on top for the long haul, a business needs a clear strategy for gaining a competitive edge. Companies that consistently stay competitive are the ones leading their industries. Here’s why it pays to be competitive: Market share retention Staying competitive helps your company hold onto and grow its market share because if you keep innovating and delivering value, it’s much easier to maintain customer loyalty. For example, if you run a tech firm, refreshing your product lines regularly keeps you relevant and your market share intact. It’s not just about holding your position; it’s about making strides. When your company stays competitive, you can target new markets and even steal market share from your rivals. Innovation and improvement Tough competition pushes companies to innovate and continuously improve. This drive often leads to more advanced products and services that can give your business a unique competitive advantage in the market. Take the automotive industry, for instance. Fierce competition has fueled the development of electric vehicles, one of the industry’s biggest innovations. But innovation isn’t just about new products; it’s also about optimizing processes and enhancing the customer experience. That’s where you gain a significant advantage. Customer loyalty Higher customer satisfaction and loyalty are other compelling reasons to stay competitive. Businesses that consistently deliver better value build a solid customer base. And when you have loyal customers, they’re less likely to switch to alternatives. It’s also much cheaper than constantly acquiring new customers. Consider an e-commerce company that regularly improves its user experience. It’s more likely to earn the trust and loyalty of its customers compared to competitors who don’t focus on user satisfaction. Delivering consistent value makes your brand “sticky” in a crowded market. Profitability Staying competitive also means managing costs efficiently while maximizing revenue. This is crucial in industries that focus on operational efficiency. A retail giant with a cost leadership strategy, for example, can remain profitable even in the most competitive environments. Efficient operations boost profitability, giving you extra resources for new initiatives or offerings. What determines the level of competitive intensity? If you want your company to thrive in a competitive environment, you need to understand what drives the competition in your industry. Here are the major factors that can shape the level of competitive intensity: Industry concentration The more companies of similar size in a market, the fiercer the competition. On the other hand, when just a few big players dominate, the competitive intensity tends to be lower. Take the airline industry in many countries, for example. It’s highly concentrated, meaning a small group of major players fiercely compete with each other. But in markets full of small to medium-sized companies, the competition can be cutthroat as everyone tries to outdo each other. This can spark rapid innovation and significant service improvements. Market growth rate Fast-growing industries usually have a lower rivalry because there’s plenty of room to capture new customers. But when an industry matures or stagnates, competition heats up as companies battle over a shrinking piece of the pie. Consider the smartphone industry, which has slowed down as most people already own a smartphone. The focus has shifted from gaining new customers to keeping the ones they already have. In a rapidly growing market, even smaller players can make a big impact. But in a slow-growth market, every customer becomes a battleground. That’s why the market growth rate is a key factor in shaping a business strategy. Differentiation potential In general, the more room there is for product differentiation in an industry, the less intense the competition. Companies that carve out a unique niche can avoid direct competition. For example, competition is minimal in the luxury market because consumers are willing to pay premium prices for exclusive products. On the other hand, producers of basic commodities, where there’s little room for differentiation, face intense competition largely driven by price. Differentiation highlights your unique strengths, attracting specific market segments and helping you build strong brand loyalty while avoiding price wars. Entry and exit barriers Industries with high barriers to entry – like expensive startup costs or strict regulations – tend to have fewer competitors because it’s harder for new brands to break in. Markets with low barriers, like e-commerce, face higher competitive intensity since new players can easily enter the fray. For example, in the pharmaceutical industry, where huge investments in R&D are required, fewer new entrants lead to less competition. Understanding these barriers helps your company plan for potential threats and opportunities. Cost structure Industries with large fixed costs and significant storage expenses are highly competitive because companies are eager to recover their costs. Similarly, industries where customers can easily switch providers face intense competition. The telecom industry is a prime example. With high fixed costs and low switching costs, competition is fierce. Companies in such industries need to manage their costs efficiently to stay competitive, which is essential for designing strategies that ensure operational efficiency and competitive pricing. How to identify the level of competition in a market Understanding the level of competition in your market is crucial for smart strategic planning and effective resource allocation. Industry competitive analysis involves assessing market size, identifying key players, understanding entry barriers, and spotting market consolidation. Here’s how Similarweb can help you tackle these tasks: 1. Size your market Grasping the market size is the first step in evaluating competitive intensity. Similarweb’s Demand Analysis tool gives you a clear view of key performance metrics for any industry. You can check out the top websites, traffic levels, and overall engagement, which will give you a sense of the market landscape. Plus, tools like Market Sizing help you measure your Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM). By analyzing unique visitors, visit frequency, and audience engagement, you’ll get a precise picture of the market potential: For example, if you’re entering the ecommerce world, these insights can help you gauge customer reach and growth opportunities. With this information, you can better allocate resources and focus your marketing efforts where they’ll have the most impact. 2. Identify top players Benchmarking is all about knowing who the market leaders are. With Similarweb, you can dive deep into traffic share, growth rates, and other engagement metrics for the top sites in your sector. This lets you pinpoint the big players and understand the competitive landscape, making it easier to identify your main rivals. Say you’re looking to break into the streaming services market. By studying the industry leaders with Similarweb’s tools, you can learn their best practices and develop strategies to compete effectively. Identifying successful competitors also reveals gaps in the market, helping you create more targeted solutions – especially if you’re a new player in the field. 3. Assess market entry barriers Understanding how tough it is to break into a market is essential, and Similarweb’s Demand Analysis feature offers key insights into this. It provides data on user loyalty and market consolidation, and it even estimates what it might cost to compete in paid search. Markets with high entry barriers typically have lower competitive intensity, while those with low barriers are often more crowded and competitive. For instance, a tech startup might face many hurdles due to R&D costs and regulatory requirements. Similarweb’s tools can help you assess these challenges, allowing you to make informed decisions about investment and risks before diving into a new market: 4. Uncover market consolidation Market consolidation shows how much of the market is controlled by the top players. Similarweb reveals the market share held by the top 1%, 5%, and 10% of companies. A highly consolidated market usually means less competition, while a fragmented market signals intense rivalry. For example, if a sector is packed with players, competition for market share will be fierce. But in markets dominated by a few key players, there’s less pressure from rivals, giving companies more room to plan strategically for growth. Understanding the level of consolidation helps you tailor your strategies to the specific dynamics of your market, enabling more effective use of resources and stronger competitive responses.
