Maybe you picture robots from sci-fi movies, or perhaps you think of chatbots you’ve interacted with online. But what if you’re a seasoned marketing professional who’s comfortable with tried-and-true methods? While sticking to what works is understandable, AI offers a treasure trove of innovative tools and solutions to boost your marketing strategies – from content creation and research to social media, video marketing, and beyond. This comprehensive AI glossary for marketers will equip you to work smarter and faster by exploring essential AI-related marketing terms. Here’s a breakdown of key AI terms marketers should be familiar with in 2024. Ultimately, knowing the terms related to artificial intelligence – and developing your marketing toolkit – should help you get more done, faster, with much better results. A – F AI Terms for Marketing AI (Artificial Intelligence) AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, including learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. In marketing, AI technologies automate tasks, personalize customer experiences, analyze data, and optimize campaign performance. A/B Testing with AI Imagine A/B testing two headlines for a blog post. AI analyzes which one performs better in terms of clicks and engagement, helping you choose the winner and maximize your content’s impact.

AI Chatbots Chatbots powered by AI can answer customer questions 24/7 on a company website, automate lead generation through chat interactions, and personalize product recommendations, creating a smoother customer experience. AI-powered Content Creation Marketers can use AI to generate content ideas, write drafts, and optimize content for different audiences. This saves significant time and resources, allowing you to focus on strategy and refinement. Algorithm Think of an algorithm as a set of instructions a computer follows to solve a problem or perform a task. In marketing, algorithms analyze data to predict trends, personalize recommendations, and optimize campaign performance across various channels. Attribution Modeling with AI By understanding which marketing channels (social media, email marketing, etc.) are driving the most conversions (customer purchases, sign-ups), marketers can optimize their budget allocation and focus on the most effective strategies. AI-driven attribution modeling helps with this by analyzing customer journeys and pinpointing the touchpoints that lead to conversions. AR (Augmented Reality) An interactive experience that combines the physical world with digital elements in real-time. Marketers use AR technology to create immersive brand experiences, showcase products in 3D, and engage customers through interactive storytelling and gamification. Automation The use of technology to perform tasks or processes with minimal human intervention. In marketing, automation tools and platforms help streamline workflows, optimize repetitive tasks, and deliver personalized messages at scale, improving efficiency and driving results. Big Data Big data refers to large volumes of data, both structured (website analytics, purchase history) and unstructured (social media conversations, customer reviews). Marketers leverage big data analytics to understand customer behavior, segment audiences, personalize campaigns, and make data-driven decisions to achieve marketing objectives. Chatbot Analytics The process of measuring and analyzing data generated by AI chatbots to gain insights into user interactions, engagement metrics, and performance indicators. Chatbot analytics help marketers understand user behavior, optimize chatbot workflows, and improve conversational experiences to drive business outcomes. Content Personalization Personalization in content is crucial for advancing customer relationships, boosting sales, and driving long-term growth. It demonstrates a deep understanding of your customers’ needs, encouraging repeat business. By delivering tailored content based on preferences, behavior, and website demographics, AI-powered algorithms analyze user data in real-time to create personalized recommendations, emails, website experiences, and advertisements, thereby increasing engagement and conversions. Conversational AI AI-powered technology that enables natural language interactions between humans and machines. In marketing, conversational AI platforms, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, engage with users in real-time conversations, answering questions, providing recommendations, and guiding them through the customer journey. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction A predictive analytics technique that forecasts the future value of a customer over their entire relationship with a brand. AI-powered CLTV prediction models analyze historical customer data to identify high-value segments, optimize acquisition and retention strategies, and maximize long-term revenue. CLV Formula Wondering how to calculate customer lifetime value on your own? Use this Customer Lifetime Value Calculator (CLTV) to estimate the net profit attributable to a client’s future relationship. CLTV also defines the maximum threshold for client acquisition. CLV = (Revenue from a single customer over their lifetime) – (The cost of acquiring them) If you’re not sure how much a customer has spent over their lifetime with your business, you can use this alternative customer lifetime value calculation: CLV = (Average annual revenue from a single customer) × (Number of years) – (Customer acquisition cost for that customer only) Customer Segmentation Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a target market into distinct groups based on shared characteristics, preferences, and behaviors. AI-driven customer segmentation algorithms analyze large datasets to identify meaningful segments, enabling marketers to personalize messaging, tailor offers, and optimize marketing campaigns for different audience segments. Similarweb’s market research tools, for instance, allow marketers to segment any industry and better understand customer behaviors and needs. The Segment Analysis tool lets you analyze specific portions of a website by building a custom segment. For example, to improve laptop-related sales for Samsung.com, comparing it to HP.com at a site level isn’t enough. Instead, you’ll want to analyze the “laptop” sections of both websites for an accurate, apples-to-apples performance assessment. As part of the capabilities within Segment Analysis, algorithms are used to ensure easier and faster segmentation based on the pages that you want to include and exclude, per website. Data Analysis The process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to uncover insights, patterns, and trends. AI-powered data analysis tools leverage machine learning algorithms to process large datasets, extract actionable insights, and inform marketing strategies and decision-making processes. For example, with Similarweb’s Data-as-a-Service (DaaS), you are able to harness the power of 30+ billion data points for comprehensive data analysis. That means you can dive deep into competitors’ online activities, analyzing their web traffic and acquisition strategies, or alternatively, monitor market leaders to maintain your business’s top position. DaaS eliminates hours of manual sifting through dashboards, providing efficient and targeted analysis. Deep Learning A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model complex patterns and relationships in data. In marketing, deep learning algorithms are used for image recognition, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and personalized content recommendations, enabling marketers to deliver more relevant and engaging experiences to customers.

For example, a chatbot like ChatGPT may embed plausible-sounding falsehoods within its generated content. This is something to always consider when using chatbots. Hyper-Personalization A marketing approach that delivers highly customized and relevant content, offers, and experiences to individual customers based on their unique preferences, behaviors, and characteristics. AI-driven hyper-personalization algorithms leverage real-time data and machine learning to deliver personalized messages across multiple channels, driving customer loyalty and engagement. Influencer Marketing with AI The use of artificial intelligence to identify, evaluate, and collaborate with influencers for marketing campaigns. AI-powered influencer marketing platforms analyze social media data to identify relevant influencers, predict campaign performance, and measure ROI, helping marketers identify the most effective influencers to reach their target audience. Large Language Model (LLM) An LLM is an AI program designed to understand and generate text. These models are trained on vast amounts of data from online sources such as blogs and message boards, giving them the ability to recognize and interpret human language. LLMs use a machine learning technique called a transformer model to process this data. In essence, an LLM is a computer program that learns to understand language by analyzing large datasets. The quality of the data used in training can significantly influence the LLM’s ability to grasp and generate natural language, so programmers often use carefully curated datasets. Machine Learning A subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. In marketing, machine learning algorithms are used for predictive analytics, customer segmentation, content personalization, and campaign optimization, helping marketers make data-driven decisions and automate processes for better results. Marketing Attribution with AI The process of assigning credit to marketing touchpoints along the customer journey using AI algorithms to determine the most effective channels and campaigns. AI-driven marketing attribution models analyze multi-channel data to accurately measure the impact of marketing efforts, optimize budget allocation, and improve ROI. Marketing Frameworks for AI Marketing frameworks for AI involve structured approaches that help businesses effectively integrate artificial intelligence into their marketing strategies. These frameworks guide the planning, implementation, and optimization of AI technologies to enhance customer engagement, streamline operations, and drive business growth. Here are a few key AI marketing frameworks: AIDA: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action PAS: Problem, Agitate, Solution BAB: Before, After, Bridge Whenever creating a prompt in your AI tool, make sure to specify the framework you’d like the output to use – along with all the other context we’ve spoken about. Alternatively, ask the AI which framework would be most appropriate and have it use that within the output too. You can learn more about this term in the dedicated blog post we wrote, “The SEM Guide to Using ChatGPT.” Micro Moments Marketing A marketing strategy that targets consumers during “micro moments” when they turn to their devices to solve an immediate need or answer a question. AI-powered micro moments marketing campaigns leverage real-time data sources and machine learning algorithms to deliver relevant messages and offers to consumers, driving engagement and conversions in real-time.

Programmatic advertising utilizes AI algorithms to automate ad placements, targeting, and bidding in real-time. This translates to personalized ads delivered to individual users across multiple channels, improving ad performance and campaign efficiency for marketers. Prompt Engineering Prompt engineering involves crafting instructions that a generative AI model can interpret and execute. A prompt is a natural language description of the task, such as “write a CV focused on field marketing experience,” which the AI then uses to generate the appropriate output. Real-time Marketing with AI In today’s fast-paced world, reacting quickly is key. Real-time marketing leverages AI to analyze data and deliver timely, relevant, and personalized messages to consumers based on their current context, behavior, and preferences. This allows marketers to react quickly to market trends, events, and customer interactions, driving higher engagement and conversions.
