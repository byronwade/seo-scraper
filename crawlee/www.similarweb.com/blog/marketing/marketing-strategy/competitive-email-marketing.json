January 4, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic We all want to know what our competitors are up to, especially if we can find out what they‚Äôre up to before they do it. Today, we‚Äôre talking about how to spy on your competitors‚Äô email marketing strategy. Here‚Äôs a question for you: What if we told you it‚Äôs not all about making up a fake email address and waiting around for your competitor‚Äôs monthly email to come through to your inbox anymore? We‚Äôve got four words for you: competitive email marketing analysis. What is competitive email marketing analysis? An email marketing competitor analysis is research into your direct competitors and their email marketing strategy and tactics. This will not only help you spot new opportunities and offer inspiration, but it should pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses within your own email marketing efforts. üìçNext stop? Optimizing your 2024 email marketing strategy to make it the best, highest-converting bunch of emails you ever did see. How to do competitor analysis for email marketing 1) Identify your email marketing competitors Competition for your business can look like a lot of things ‚Äì perhaps it‚Äôs a business that‚Äôs dominating the SERPs for your brand‚Äôs core keywords, maybe it‚Äôs someone stealing all your social media followers, or maybe, they‚Äôre better than you at emails. Today, we‚Äôre focusing on the people who are crushing email marketing in your space. Through competitor research, you‚Äôll get a good idea of who your general competitors are ‚Äì those selling the same products or services as you, as well as having the same target audience. But with email marketing, you can go broader than that. Say you‚Äôre a finance software company ‚Äì sure you want to know what emails your direct competitors are sending, but it would also be useful to follow others in the SaaS space generally. To identify these specific competitors, you can use tools like: Google Alerts Send View BuzzSumo These tools will give you an idea of what topics they cover, and give you intel into what they include in their email marketing before it hits your inbox. 2) Find their target audience We‚Äôve established that these guys are good with their emails, but who are they targeting? Let the social media stalking begin ‚Äì but don‚Äôt just stop at Followers and Following lists, look into who‚Äôs engaging with posts and therefore (quite possibly) the brand as a whole. Even if they‚Äôre complaining about a refund that hasn‚Äôt come in yet, there‚Äôs a strong likelihood they‚Äôre signed up to the brand‚Äôs emails. However, to get a more thorough idea of who these competitors‚Äô target audiences are, you want data. Real user data. Similarweb offers the tools that provide this kind of data, including demographics for any website around the world. You can even look into Audience Interests and Audience Overlap, comparing how you or other competitors (or both) stack up against each other. Here you can see the overlap ‚Äì or lack of ‚Äì of the audience between Crocs, Timberland, Birkenstock, and Vans. This just shows how big the audience is Birkenstock, as a brand that has become a daily essential for many, versus Crocs, a brand that is very much one of a kind. 3) Reveal their email marketing strategy Now it‚Äôs time to actually look at your competitors‚Äô strategy. This includes: What content they‚Äôre sending out (eg. drip campaigns, product updates, newsletters, partnership emails) How frequently they push out emails (eg. weekly, monthly, bi-monthly) Where recipients are being sent to (eg. through CTAs) What their subject lines are (eg. straight to the point, fun, statistics) Who they‚Äôre coming from (eg. the company, a marketing person, a subject specialist) By opting in to their emails and analyzing each of these points, you‚Äôll get a good idea of their email marketing strategy. For example, you will probably find your competitor sends out multiple types of emails per month ‚Äì one for content distribution, one for product updates or news, and several for lead nurture. The CTAs will encourage them to check out the blog, or try out the features that were mentioned. Ask yourself questions like: What‚Äôs working for them in their email marketing? How are you engaging with the content? Is it visually appealing or enticing you to click on the CTAs? What factors or elements stand out the most? Where could they do better? Now what? Well, it‚Äôs all well and good analyzing what‚Äôs strong and what‚Äôs not through your own opinion, but is it actually performing? Use tools like Similarweb‚Äôs Marketing Channels to see just how much traffic your competitors‚Äô email marketing brings them. Let‚Äôs take Hubspot as an example, which saw over 10% of its website traffic come from email marketing. Not only that, but you can use our Website Category Analysis to see who in your industry are the top dogs in terms of email marketing, via Email Leaders. It‚Äôs time to optimize your own email marketing strategy You‚Äôve done your competitive analysis, you‚Äôve got all your findings, now what? Well, now it‚Äôs time to create ‚Äì or optimize ‚Äì your own email marketing strategy. Using your competitor analysis, you will be able to: Steal from your competitors‚Äô strengths Be wary of their weaknesses Observe and act on opportunities Prepare for competitive threats In following the content your competitors push out, here are a few questions you need to be asking yourself now: 1) What content should I include in our emails? The research into your target audience and research into your market (including your competitors) is crucial to choosing the right content for your email marketing. With this research, you can understand the type of content that is most engaged with, so you can see results from your email marketing efforts. Value is key. Consider what kind of value the content you‚Äôre sending out can offer your customers, and what goals you want to achieve. Is it educational for those being onboarded, is it touching on prospects‚Äô pain points to push them down the funnel, will it help prospects or customers drive business success to encourage conversion or retention? Your email marketing can cover all bases with long-form content, testimonials, social proofing, video, GIFs, and so on. You can be creative with your emails, but keep in line with what your audience would find valuable or gripping. And don‚Äôt forget: make sure the content in your emails is optimized for mobile ‚Äì that‚Äôs where most people are reading them these days. In fact, over 60% of emails are read on mobile. 2) What makes a good email subject line? In terms of subject lines and general tone of voice, this ‚Äì again ‚Äì will very much depend on the target audience; who they are, but also what roles they have within companies. Ideally, your brand‚Äôs tone of voice should stay consistent with content across your website, blog, social media and any other platforms. It‚Äôs important to note that your subject line needs to align with the goal and contents of the email too ‚Äì not to mention fitting in with that dreaded character limit. Sure, you can use click-bait and gimmicks to encourage opens but if people don‚Äôt take the next step, it‚Äôs worthless to you as a business. 3) What makes for a good CTA or call-to-action? A good call-to-action should flow nicely with the rest of your content; as they read on and reach the end of your email, your audience should feel encouraged or persuaded to take the next action. That might be to read a blog post, try out a product themselves, book a meeting with sales, or hear what other customers are saying about your service. Whatever the CTA may be, it‚Äôs crucial that your readers understand what action will occur once they click, so make it as clear as possible. To foster this curiosity and want for more, there are a number of CTA tips: Use strong and actionable verbs to begin your CTA Provide value or incentive for your audience to act now Create a sense of urgency Keep it simple and concise, yet persuasive Inject some energy and enthusiasm with creative wording 4) How often should I perform competitive email marketing analysis? Now, we‚Äôre living in an ever-changing, and ultra-competitive landscape. That means strategies change; yours changes, so do your competitors‚Äô. To stay informed about what your competitors are up to, regular monitoring is essential.
