September 13, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic It’s a competitive world out there, with so many websites and so many solutions doing the same thing. Knowing what your competitors are up to is gold for your own strategy, and can be what it takes to set you (way) above the rest. With the right tools for competitor research and analysis, you can uncover all their strategies and secrets – from the audience and keywords they’re targeting, and how they’re targeting them. In this post, we teach you how to spy on your competitors’ marketing strategy; work out what they’re doing well, what they’re doing not-so-well, and the opportunities you have to steal back those gold medals. How to find out your competitors’ marketing strategies Being able to see your competitors’ marketing strategies almost seems illegal, doesn’t it? But with all the right data sources and competitor intelligence, Similarweb gets all the information you need in one place. In fact, it’s an unmissable gateway to improve and optimize your own marketing strategy and marketing plan against these competitors. So, it’s fair to say, you want in. Step one: Find your competitors The thing is: the businesses you think are competitors, might actually not be your competitors, and the people you don’t think are competitors, might actually be competitors. Here’s how to find your competitors: 1) Keyword research With the right kind of keyword research, you should also get a good idea of who else is already ranking for them on both paid and organic search. Similarweb not only provides search volume and other related keyword ideas within our Keyword Generator, but also information into the top competing websites for organic desktop competitors, paid desktop competitors, and mobile competitors for specific search terms. Our Rank Tracker is one way you can track the competition on your target keywords, including any newcomers. If you see them coming in hot, you can react fast and make sure they’re not winning the organic traffic that is so rightfully yours. 2) Competitor research Competitor research is made up of a bunch of things, but it starts by looking at the market and looking into the products that would compete with yours. Talking to your sales team is a really helpful way to find out about which competitors are coming up in conversations in the sales process, and so is looking into online communities like social media and related forums. Listen out for who people are talking about, because that’s the limelight you want for yourself (… and not to mention the fact that word of mouth is the main factor behind 20-50% of purchasing decisions). For some more immediate and in-depth analysis, you can use our Web Category Analysis feature. You can view any market and it will reveal the top 10,000 players in it, split by industry leaders and rising players. Step two: Understand your competitors’ website performance But just how much competition are they to your brand? Here’s where you look into their website performance, because where they rank on the SERPs doesn’t necessarily coincide with an effective or high-converting website. Using a platform like Similarweb, you can gain full insight into your competitors’ website performance, including: Website traffic: Gain insight into your competitors’ website analytics and compare it against your own. Plus, spot spikes in traffic where they do particularly well throughout the year with trending or seasonal keywords. Marketing channels: Get an understanding of your competitors’ marketing mix tactics, and work out their focus areas or top-performing channels. Landing pages: Seeing where you competitors get their traffic from helps reveal their strategy and dive deeper into the keywords that get users there. Paid landing page Analyzer: See which keywords competitors are bidding on, the CPC and estimated traffic from them. Demographics: Understand more about who’s landing on, browsing, and maybe buying from your competitors’ website. SERP rank tracker: Keep an eye on all the keywords behind your competitors’ traffic, seeing where they rank for and which search terms drive success. This includes tracking what new pages your competitors create, to see how quickly they rank. But maybe they’re one of those competitors that aren’t a full competitor, but only a little-bit-a-competitor – you know, they offer one product out of five that is very similar to yours? Or you’ve got a specific competitor that’s doing well with a feature that you also want to be doing well with, and you want to understand exactly how it’s going for them (and why). That right there, is why we introduced Segments. With Segments, you can choose specific pages on your competitors’ websites and track their performance against your own website. Above, you can see the traffic and engagement metrics to the ‘loans’ pages for these leading banks. Segmenting by topic is a great way to get ahead in competitive analysis because you’re getting the specific information you need. Step three: Identify your competitors’ top marketing channels Your next question to ask is: where does the traffic come from? What marketing channels are they using to get traffic to their website? To truly understand website performance, you want to know where it’s coming from. The answer = Marketing Channels on Similarweb. Using our real-time and real-user data, we can spill the beans on traffic sources for websites all around the world – including your biggest and baddest competitors. You can even see how you and your competitors weigh up against industry benchmarks. Step four: Analyze your competitor’s paid and organic keywords In your initial keyword research to uncover your true competitors, you would have got some insight into your core keywords. But maybe your competitors are onto something that you haven’t thought of… This is your chance to dive deeper and analyze your competitors’ paid and organic keywords – every single one. Because hey, you never know what you could be missing. Make the most of not only the freshest keyword data on the market and our oh-so-unique ‘date picker’ to analyze keyword performance for a specific day, week, month or year but also our wide range of filters. Our filters mean you can quickly slim down your search to just organic or paid search terms, branded or non-branded, or your competitors’ keywords that are soaking up the SERP features. Opt for the view of non-branded Paid Traffic keywords, and you can see which keywords are your competitors’ main focus, along with the cost per click (CPC) for each search term. In terms of branded keywords, here’s a fun fact: with Similarweb, you get a Brand Protection alert to notify you when a competitor is making moves on your branded keywords. On top of this, we’ve also got our Keyword Gap tool. This is where you can see how your keyword strategy weighs up against your competitors, for both paid and organic search. With a visual (and a downloadable list below it) of the core keywords you share, the keywords you’ve got and they don’t, and the keywords you’re missing. If paid marketing is your thing, or you’re just nosey about your competitors’ paid activities, Similarweb has a whole section dedicated to tools for paid website analysis, providing competitive insight into: PPC spends Paid landing pages Search ads Product ads And more paid competitors that might have gone under your radar Step five: Look into your competitors’ best-performing pages Next stop: Finding what people like so much about your competitors – and one way to do this is to find out which pages they’re landing on. With Similarweb, you get two views to show you the best-performing pages: Organic Pages and Popular Pages. With Organic Pages, you’ll see the leading SEO pages and the exact keywords driving traffic. See whether a page is trending up or down and filter by keywords or URLs to better understand which page types and content strategies are working. Popular Pages gives you a breakdown of a website’s traffic to see the traffic share per page for all marketing channels, but there’s also a Trending filter so you can spot any new pages or new campaigns being run that are gaining traffic quick. Having the top-performing pages highlighted and listed in front of you makes snooping easy, revealing some very good competitive insights in just a click and scroll of your mouse. (Personally, as an avid weather-checker, I’m interested to see football being more popular than bbc.co.uk/weather. Clearly refreshing the page 56 times daily isn’t enough). Step six: Set up a Competitive Tracker and never miss a beat As you well know from your own marketing strategy, it’s subject to change. In fact, if it doesn’t change, you’re doing something wrong. By setting up a Competitive Tracker, you’ll be able to keep on top of any changes made to your competitors’ strategies or digital performance in one, easy-to-use dashboard. Updated monthly, the tracker makes sure you never miss a beat with up to 25 (!) competitors. Oh, and it only takes a minute to set-up – just follow these quick steps: Step 1: Go to “Competitive Trackers” in the left sidebar Step 2: Click the blue “Create a tracker” button Step 3: Enter your website, then follow the simple instructions on-screen How should competitor research impact your own marketing strategy? So, what does this all mean to you? Why is competitor research such an important part of your marketing strategy? Because competitor research and analysis helps you with: Benchmarking Winning the traffic you want Boosting engagement and conversions With in-depth competitor research, you can take your findings, and apply them to your own marketing strategy – that might be to help optimize your current strategy or revamp it completely.

Try Similarweb free FAQs What is a competitor’s marketing strategy? A competitor’s marketing strategy refers to the plan and tactics they use to promote their products or services. This includes their choice of advertising channels, branding, content creation, audience targeting, pricing strategies, and more. Why is it important to know your competitors’ marketing strategy? Knowing how to understand the marketing strategy of your competitor will benefit you in a bunch of ways, including spotting gaps in the market, adapting and improving your own strategy, staying ahead and differentiating yourself from your competition and making more informed decisions. How can I find out about my competitor’s marketing strategy? While you won’t get a full blueprint, you can come close to it with a tool that offers competitive analysis – like Similarweb. We’ve got the real-time, real-user data you need to understand a competitor’s marketing strategy and use those insights to optimize your own. How often should I review my competitors’ marketing strategies? The frequency depends on your industry and how rapidly it evolves. For fast-moving sectors like tech, you might want to check monthly or even weekly. For more stable industries, a quarterly or biannual check may suffice. Should I copy my competitor’s strategy for guaranteed results? Simply copying a competitor’s strategy doesn’t guarantee success. What works for one company might not work for another due to differences in branding, audience, resources, and more.
