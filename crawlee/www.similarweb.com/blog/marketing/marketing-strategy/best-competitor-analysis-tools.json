Because with the right insights, you can determine all the strengths and weaknesses of your competition, helping you to make smarter, more data-driven decisions for an optimized marketing strategy. After all, you can’t be competitive if you don’t know what your competitors are up to, and with the best competitive analysis tools, you can get your hands on those invaluable and actionable insights easily.

There’s no other competitive analysis tool quite like Similarweb. But, let’s dig a little deeper into the platform so you have a chance to see it in action. Here’s a brief step-by-step of how to run a thorough competitive analysis using Similarweb: 1) Find your true competitors Before you jump straight into analyzing your competitors, be sure you’re focusing on the right ones. Similarweb’s Organic Competitors feature draws on various traffic and search factors to illustrate the search overlap between you and your closest competitors. They may not be what you expect. Fiddle with the metrics to gauge the degree of overlap between you and your rivals based on various factors such as search overlap, total traffic and paid traffic. With each different metric you compare, the landscape of competitors may shift. 2) Analyze their website performance Once you’ve got your closest competitors nailed, head to Similarweb’s Website Analysis > Website Performance for a comprehensive overview of their traffic and engagement data: Check out their monthly visits, traffic trends over time and engagement metrics like visit duration, pages per visit and bounce rate to take the measure of your rivals 3) Look at their keyword strategy Next, find out how they got that traffic in the first place. Do they have a killer keyword strategy? Find out using Similarweb’s Keyword Analysis feature. Type in your competitor’s site to reveal their top traffic-driving keywords. Filter by branded, non-branded, organic or paid to refine your search and then dig deep into analysis with metrics like search volume, keyword difficulty, search intent and cost-per-click (CPC).
