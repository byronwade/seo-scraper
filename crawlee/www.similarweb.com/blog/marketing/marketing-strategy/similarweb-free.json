Later, we’ll explore additional free tools you can use anytime without a trial. 1. Perform keyword research Keeping your keyword strategy competitive requires accurate search data and real-user insights – Similarweb unlocks both. A free Similarweb account allows you to use the Search Analysis & Keyword Research module to tap into the keywords driving traffic and engagement within your industry. Discover everything you need for a granular view of keywords across competitors, geography, devices, seasonality, and more. Keyword Generator Similarweb’s Keyword Generator allows you to explore keyword ideas with access to over 5 billion keywords from three of the biggest search engines: Google, Amazon, and YouTube. This tool helps you create a unified strategy across different platforms. With a trial account, you can see a worldwide view and filter by both the last 28 days and the last 3 months. For example, if you’re a flower delivery provider, you can see trending keywords related to the seed term ‘flowers delivery’ along with their search volume, winning website, and other key engagement metrics to build an effective SEO strategy. Keyword Metrics At the heart of effective keyword research is access to the right metrics, tracked across key measurement platforms and aligned with your internal reporting. Gain insights from unique metrics to make better, data-backed decisions. Learn about critical metrics like Keyword Difficulty, Search Intent, and Zero Clicks, which help you target the right keywords for your SEO strategy.

Get a deep view of the mobile web and optimize your strategy accordingly. Keyword Comparison Our free keyword research tool lets you easily find new keywords by benchmarking them against each other. Get a side-by-side comparison of the most critical performance metrics in a single click to identify the best keywords for your SEO strategy. Keywords by Industry Find the top keywords for a specific industry. See the distributions of paid vs. organic traffic, search traffic by channel and source, and many insights on volume, leaders, and trends for the top keywords in the industry. Note that to unlock the full list of Keywords by Industry, you will need to have a paid account. Keyword Gap This tool helps uncover new opportunities by analyzing which keywords send you traffic vs. your competitors. The analysis you can conduct with the Keyword Gap tool helps spot new keyword optimization opportunities to drive more traffic and boost conversions. The free tool allows you to filter by Desktop vs. Mobile Web, and three different timeframes (1, 2, and 3 months). For example, Zara can see what its competitors – Forever 21, Bershka, Urban Outfitters, and Asos – are competing for on Mobile Web, with Asos clearly winning many keywords in the competitive set. 2. Analyze any website’s traffic Similarweb’s Website Anaylsis tool is one of our most frequently used features. It provides detailed data on any domain, offering essential insights for competitive analysis. This tool allows you to compare website traffic and engagement metrics for up to 5 sites, identify the primary channels driving traffic to competitors, and understand their marketing strategies. Additionally, the paid version provides insights into audience overlap (between the sites), new vs. returning website visitors, and top backlinks and referring domains, allowing users to evaluate their competitors’ link equity and improve their referral traffic strategies. You can run unlimited website queries for free using our tool (but up to 15 per day). Simply log into your account, type in the website you’re interested in, and click the ‘Analyze’ button for a list of traffic and engagement metrics. How to analyze a website with Similarweb Benchmarking your prospects’ website reach and analyzing the quality of their traffic is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of their marketing activities. This analysis allows you to identify growth potential, areas for improvement, and competitor strengths. When logged in, use the ‘Compare’ button to add up to four additional domains for comparison – choose websites that compete with your prospect. From the platform’s left menu, select the Traffic and Engagement view to understand and benchmark their reach, health, and performance. Use the following metrics to assess your prospect’s reach and generate valuable insights: Total Visits: Understand the total audience reach of your prospect versus their main competitors.

Uncover your competitors’ channel activities The Marketing Channels Overview – found inside the Website Analysis module – offers valuable traffic and engagement metrics for each marketing channel. Identify the channels where you are excelling and those with growth opportunities, evaluate engagement and traffic quality, and spot shifts in your competitors’ strategies over time. Use this free tool to shape your channel strategy effectively across various channels: Direct: Assess a website’s brand strength through direct traffic, indicating awareness and demand. Email: If you see high email traffic, this normally suggests a loyal customer base engaging via an owned mailing list. Referrals: Significant referral traffic indicates a strong affiliate strategy or substantial media coverage. Social: Consistent social traffic suggests a loyal community of users. Organic Search: Well-optimized for search engines, with strong brand awareness indicated by branded organic visits. Paid Search: High volume traffic from PPC & SEM indicates significant advertising budget allocation for brand awareness or targeted audience campaigns. Display Advertising: If you see a website getting a lot of traffic from display ads, this shows a high investment in increasing brand awareness or targeting specific audiences. To optimize your digital marketing strategy, use the organic search channel to highlight keyword opportunities where you are currently losing traffic. To view the traffic performance of up to five websites for the last 1 month, 2 months, or 3 months, follow these steps: Go to the Website Analysis module. Enter a website and navigate to the Marketing Channels page. Click +Compare to add up to four additional sites.

Discover relevant affiliate opportunities by identifying the best referral websites in your industry and adding these affiliates to your partner lists. Additionally, find out who your competitors are partnering with for referral traffic. 2.

This lets you compare and monitor key metrics like month-over-month change, clicked vs. non-clicked, and more. 3. Analyze your affiliates Use the Analyze Affiliates tool to evaluate affiliates based on traffic volume and traffic sources. This provides an in-depth understanding of the competitive landscape. From the sidebar navigation, select Analyze Affiliates, enter an affiliate website, and click +Compare to add up to four more websites. The Website Performance page offers an overview of traffic insights for the analyzed sites. High traffic and visit duration, rather than bounce rate, signify high performance. 4. Monitor potential affiliate partners Create and monitor Affiliate Lists to stay ahead of your competition. The Monitor Partners tool allows you to view and monitor all the Affiliate Lists you have created or that have been shared with you in a centralized location. From the sidebar menu, select Monitor Affiliates and click See All Partners in a list to get a full view of traffic insights for a saved list. Explore the insights for each domain in your partner lists, analyze traffic share, change, volume, trends, and more. Simply click on an affiliate link in the table to access the Overview page for that list item. Here’s an example: 6.

With the Paid Search Overview tool, you can reveal competitors’ SEM performance by understanding the keywords and ads driving their paid search traffic. The free PPC Spend tool lets you discover estimated ad spend across multiple currencies and learn when competitors rely on paid search in their tactical marketing mix. Analyzing Paid Landing Pages – another easy-to-use free PPC tool – helps you build attractive pages that drive high-performing campaigns by learning from those already delivering. You can also spy on competitors’ ads to improve your search ad performance by revealing their top ads, targeted paid keywords, and costs per click. Target high-performing keywords with traffic, engagement, and PPC spend insights to understand competitors’ performance across seasonal campaigns. Additionally, you can identify opportunities to differentiate your paid search strategy and improve your performance. Gain a unique view of when and how much competitors are investing in paid search campaigns, how they perform at driving traffic, and which paid channels they are using. How to use Similarweb’s Paid Search Overview To view key paid search metrics and insights for up to four competitor sites, simply: Go to Website Analysis > Paid Search > Overview. Enter the website you’d like to analyze. Click +Compare to add up to four additional websites. Use the filters in the upper right to set the time period, country, and type of traffic (desktop or mobile web) you would like to analyze. Mark the Compare to checkbox for side-by-side data comparison to the previous time period if available. Here’s a screenshot that illustrates what this looks like: If you’re eBay, you can monitor the top paid keywords and spending trends of key competitors like Walmart, Etsy, and Target. This information helps you refine your PPC budget and evaluate the effectiveness of your own paid search campaigns. 8.
