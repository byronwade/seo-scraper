April 16, 2021 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Who’s your target audience? What’s your market? These are the most common questions that marketers are asked, and for good reason. Your target audience lets you get to know your potential customers and create highly focused marketing campaigns that connect with them. But, it goes beyond that. To reach your target audience, you need to get inside their heads. Digging into who your customers are and what they are thinking about day-to-day will be the key to understanding what they are looking for in a product and what type of communication will speak to them. In addition to considering these big questions, you’ll want to ground your buyer personas by building a complete picture. Give them names, family statuses, hobbies, jobs, and socio-economic statuses. Map out their concerns with potential products, their motivations, preferences, pain points, and brand affiliations. Taking the time to create accurate buyer personas based on well-researched metrics based on existing customers and or prospective customers will give you and your team the knowledge you need to focus your marketing efforts and marketing analysis tools so they meet your customer in the right place with the right marketing messages. What are buyer personas? A buyer persona is a way of imagining and representing your ideal customer based on research and knowledge of your customer base. The idea behind a buyer persona is not to base it on a specific customer, but rather the ideal customer base for your product. Why are buyer personas important? Let’s think about it like this: You’ve created a solid marketing strategy with top-notch campaigns that you know are going to kill it on social media and your blog. Everything is ready: the content, the graphics, the timeline, and it’s time to launch. You send it out into the depths of the internet. When they start to come in, they’re not producing the return on investment (ROI) you expected. You’re not hitting your goals or seeing the conversion rates. There are a lot of factors that could be influencing the results here. But most likely, there’s a disconnect between your marketing messages, where you’re publishing, and your target customers. Buyer personas help you avoid these types of costly and time-consuming mistakes by honing in on the important details of the different types of customers you appeal to. Types of buyer personas When building your buyer persona, there are key considerations for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-customer (B2C) companies. B2B brands need to profile companies in their buyer personas (B2B buyer persona). However, it’s important to note that the persona itself is not about the entire business, but the actual person in the target company that can make purchasing decisions. You can draw your inspiration from doing a little poking around on LinkedIn. B2C companies need to create personas around their ideal customers. Part of this process is identifying the buyer’s pain points, who they are, what their preferences are when it comes to making purchases, and their overall needs in the industry. There aren’t specific, standard types of buyer personas. Each business should create multiple personas in order to address specific customer needs. This is because each business is unique and has its own marketing needs, so the more personalized the better. So how do you create a detailed buyer persona? How to create buyer personas [5 simple steps] Building your buyer personas is a process that involves various steps. If you guess about your customers, their wants, and needs, you’ll likely create a buyer persona that is off the mark. Here’s what you should do: Research. Where to start? Meet your current customers. They are real people, so take the time to get to know them by inviting them in for interviews or sending them surveys. Once you figure out the common threads between your customers, building the personas will be easier. Dive into the numbers. This is where analysis comes in. Where are your customers coming from? How are they reaching you? What devices are they using? What are their demographics? Are there any trends you can identify? You can use tools like Google Analytics or social media to gain a better understanding of your ideal customer base. Conduct market research on your competitors. Using Marketing Intelligence platforms allows you to gain insight into your competitors and their markets. This is a critical step for all businesses. For example, with Similarweb, you can see which channels are most popular at bringing in website traffic for your site and competitors. With that information combined with what you already know about your customers, you can create a data-backed customer persona and update it as trends change over time.
