September 18, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Navigating the digital world without monitoring your competitors is like trying to run a marathon blindfolded. You just wouldn’t do it. You need to be tracking them regularly to stay in tune with how your industry is evolving and what your competitors are up to (and how they’re out-performing you.) Competitive monitoring shines a light on super important aspects of your industry’s landscape, from highlighting your competitor’s winning strategies to tracking new, game-changing product launches. With this intel you’ll make strategic, data-driven decisions, anticipate market shifts and identify your competitors’ untapped opportunities. As long as you have the right tools to do so ️ That’s where Similarweb can help with our top-notch competitive analysis tools. But more on that later. What is competitive monitoring? Competitive monitoring is the process of identifying, evaluating, and monitoring the landscape of your competitors. This process looks at things like the competition’s sales prospecting, offerings, pricing, marketing tactics, and product launches and developments. The key benefits of analyzing the competition: Make better data-driven choices, instead of relying on hunches Learn from their successes to improve your own strategies Use their weaknesses and shortcomings to your advantage Discover intel that may hint at their future objectives Increase sales and ROI due to continuous adaptations to market changes Understand market gaps and how to fill them Think of competitive monitoring as a window into your industry, allowing you to see exactly what’s going on around you. Having this birds-eye-view is critical if you want to grow your business and become a leader in your niche. Which competitors should you be monitoring? There are two key types of competitors that you should regularly be tracking: direct competitors and indirect competitors. Here’s how to identify both: Direct competitors Direct competitors are businesses that have the same or similar offerings as your own business. These competitors should be your highest priority, as they pose the most immediate threat to your business. If there’s one thing consumers have, it’s options – and lots of them. So, you can pretty much guarantee that potential customers will compare your offering to the offering of many, many others. Let’s take Wendy’s for example. Their direct competitors would be other fast-food chains like McDonald’s, Burger King, Arby’s, Chick-fil-A. In such a fierce competitive arena, you can bet Wendy’s has entire teams dedicated to diligently monitoring and tracking their direct competitors to stay ahead of the competition – Frosty, anyone? The bottom line: in the face of so much competition, it helps to identify where your competitors fall short, so you can better satisfy the needs of potential customers and win their business. Indirect competitors Indirect competitors are those that offer a different type of product or service than your business, but still serve the same consumer base. They’re not as immediately threatening to your business as direct competitors, but it’s important to keep an eye on them. Why? Because the insight you glean from tracking indirect competitors highlights new perspectives, approaches and ideas that your business may have missed. It widens your scope of focus and broadens your view of the industry you’re in. As a result, it can spark new strategies to grow and adapt to the needs of your target audience. For example, let’s say you run an at-home workout subscription. Your indirect competitors would be in-person gyms like Planet Fitness and Gold’s Gym. You both solve the same customer problem, but in different ways. Who in your organization should be tracking competitors? In short, competitive monitoring can benefit almost every part of your business: Leadership: Your leadership team needs to get a deep understanding of your competitors’ business models and marketing tactics. They’ll not only make better-informed decisions, but have an easier time explaining to investors why they should invest in you, and not the other guys. Product teams: When monitoring competitors, product teams stay on pulse of new produce releases and enhanced feature announcements, as well as products your competition has decided to discontinue. They can then develop strategies on how to differentiate your product or service from the rest. Business development teams: Any good business developer understands the importance of competitor tracking. It’s essential for understanding the current state of the industry, new and unexplored market opportunities, as well as strategic partnership opportunities. Marketing teams: Competitive monitoring helps marketers understand how competitors are positioning themselves, which audiences they’re targeting, what channels they’re using, etc. All this is gold for coming up with winning, data-driven marketing strategies. Sales teams: When trying to make a sale, it’s essential to be able to explain how your offerings compare to the competition – and, ideally, how your business outperforms them.
