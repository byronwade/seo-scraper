August 23, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Bidding on a competitor‚Äôs brand can be a powerful strategy. But what if you‚Äôre the ones being targeted? üéØ A competitor can capitalize on the effort you‚Äôve invested in driving traffic to your website, aiming for quick wins by bidding on your branded keywords. Not ideal. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to be on the pulse of competitors bidding on branded terms that your company‚Äôs image and reputation are built on. But first, it‚Äôs important to understand exactly what competitor brand bidding is and how it‚Äôs done. You may even be considering this as a potential strategy, so we‚Äôve got the full picture right here. Let‚Äôs jump right in. What is competitor bidding? Competitor bidding is when businesses strategically bid on certain keywords (usually branded, but not always) that belong to another brand. This strategy aims to divert potential customers from one brand to another, positioning the competitor‚Äôs ad above the targeted brand and capturing its traffic. This means that when someone intentionally searches for your brand, they may see your competitors‚Äô ad before yours and click there instead. Sneaky right? That‚Äôs why so many businesses think it‚Äôs illegal. We‚Äôre here to tell you that it‚Äôs absolutely not. The only caveat is although anyone can bid on a competitor‚Äôs brand name, that brand name can‚Äôt be written in the ad itself. So, really, as long as they don‚Äôt pretend to be you, there‚Äôs nothing stopping your competitors from targeting the keywords most important to your brand. And vice versa! Most brands try to fly under the radar and divert the user to their site on the sly. Some companies, however, want to grab attention by getting more creative with their competitive ads. It‚Äôs often quite funny to see ‚Äì when it‚Äôs not happening to you, of course. Take this iconic example of Apple and Samsung‚Äôs long standing rivalry playing out in a branded bidding war (an oldie but a goodie): How do I know if a competitor is bidding on my brand? Discovering if a competitor is bidding on your branded terms can be challenging. Nobody has time to manually slug through the SERPs searching for new competitive moves. To properly keep track of competitive bidding, you need a search ad monitoring tool to do it for you. Here at Similarweb, our Brand Protection tool allows you to track the keywords that are most important to your business. These could be both branded terms and non-branded terms that speak to your core offerings and values. You can view all the websites that are bidding on your key terms in real time. These are likely to be your established competitors (no surprises there), but also new competitors or copy-cat sites. You‚Äôll be able to see details of their actual ads so you can check out how their ad creatives compare to yours. We all know the competition doesn‚Äôt sleep, so we also give you an optional email alert system that notifies you when bids are made on your branded keywords, so you can identify threats as soon as they emerge. Take it a step further with our in-depth reports that let you discover how long their ads have been active, how much of a threat they are and useful ad performance metrics like their position in the SERPs. How can I stop competitors from running ads on my branded keywords? Awareness is only half the battle. So, what can you actually do about it? If a competitor is bidding on your brand keywords in Google ads, there‚Äôs nothing you can do to stop them from actually bidding, but you can turn things back in your favor by reacting quickly and decisively. 1) Launch a counter-offence ü§∫ Target the keyword more aggressively: If you want to reclaim the top spot for your branded term, simply being more assertive in your keyword strategy for the particular keyword can help regain your traffic share. Allocate more budget: No one is suggesting getting caught in a bidding war, but for keywords that are important enough, consider investing more to increase your chances to reclaim your ad‚Äôs position. Refine your ad copy: Ad copy can make a world of difference. Look at your competitors ad creatives to see if their visuals, messaging or CTAs are more appealing and enticing to the target audience than yours. Take back the edge by incorporating their best ad strategies as you refine your own. Satisfying. 2) Make it less profitable for them to bid in the future üìâ This is a defensive strategy for those willing to play the long game: make it your ultimate goal to discourage competitors from bidding on your branded keywords in the first place.
