July 27, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic The computer/electronics industry spent over $7.5 billion on PPC ads over the past three years. That’s a pretty penny. It works out to about $1 for every person on the planet spent in just one industry. And it’s not just electronics, paid marketing spend as a whole went up 12.5% in the last year. So who are the big spenders and what are the search terms they’re fighting over? Feel free to scroll ahead to the most clicked keywords by industry – but first I’m going to review the top spending businesses and the keyword bidding trends. Top paid search spenders The top three spending companies on paid search ads in the world are: Google.com Amazon.com Wayfair.com They are market leaders and all fall within the industries spending the most on PPC: electronics and ecommerce. In Google’s case, there’s an assumption that it spends so much because it ‘owns’ search. Additionally, since both Google and Amazon are active across multiple verticals such as ecommerce, streaming services, and more, this is likely why they are the top two spenders. As for Wayfair sliding into the third spot for the amount spent, it’s important to note, that the popular website does not have any storefronts so it makes sense that it spends more on its online business than competitors such as walmart.com. Show me the money: keywords advertisers spent the most on Over $200 million was spent on the keyword “car insurance” in the last 12 months making it the second most expensive keyword worldwide. Unsurprisingly, the most expensive keyword worldwide was “Google ads”. “VPN” appears twice within the top 20, and “uber eats” and “Disney plus” both had over $93 million bid on them during the time period analyzed. As anyone who has tried to work from home – especially anyone with kids – can attest, it’s not surprising that those keywords are high up on the most purchased list. Most expensive PPC keywords Keyword Spend (USD) google ads $436,942,426 car insurance $252,505,881 shopify $154,643,121 ebay $148,279,270 docusign $140,571,150 vpn $131,445,943 shein $121,946,106 auto insurance $120,406,364 car insurance quotes $119,961,102 instacart $105,408,828 renters insurance $99,450,695 honey $95,395,415 uber eats $93,926,658 disney plus $93,042,762 grubhub $84,389,433 amazon $83,451,131 canva $79,082,625 etoro $75,696,145 etsy $73,867,434 car rental $73,352,909 aliexpress $70,810,132 doordash $69,704,156 wordpress $65,253,135 adwords $65,252,244 auto insurance quotes $63,919,439 mailchimp $62,336,020 allstate $61,765,405 alibaba $58,396,914 wayfair $57,849,601 mortgage calculator $57,280,211 website builder $57,066,672 nike $56,828,473 google adwords $56,735,070 godaddy $56,539,531 booking $55,381,527 rocket mortgage $53,993,259 asana $52,700,250 homeowners insurance $52,504,566 chromebook $52,050,133 free vpn $50,077,399 Most-clicked paid keywords by industry Traffic doesn’t necessarily mean clicks, although they are related. Depending on your campaign goals you may aim for both, but since clicks are more likely to mean profit, I’m going to focus on the paid keywords driving the most clicks for three major industries. Top paid arts and entertainment keywords Entertainment giant, disney.com, made this list twice with “disney plus” driving over 44 million clicks and “disney” winning about 15 million clicks over the past year alone. However, amazon.com is giving the brand a run for its money with “amazon prime video” ringing in 35 million visits and “prime video” scooping up another 33 million. On a personal note, I was a little surprised to see netflix.com wasn’t on our top paid keywords list for arts and entertainment… are we in the upside down? Most clicked on paid keywords – arts and entertainment Keyword Paid Traffic disney plus 44,850,487 spotify 36,064,038 amazon prime video 35,245,901 prime video 33,921,874 hbo max 27,657,807 youtube 26,736,611 disney 15,127,797 amazon prime 14,144,192 crunchyroll 13,156,238 youtube music 10,697,691 hbomax 6,269,754 vimeo 5,620,245 hbo 5,365,174 amazon video 4,005,074 redbubble 3,739,754 disneyplus 3,623,395 primevideo 3,613,321 peacock 3,561,222 zee5 3,415,789 paramount plus 3,385,382 Top paid ecommerce keywords “Amazon” was by far the paid keyword driving the most clicks in this industry. It single-handedly saw over 355 clicks worldwide over the past year. Amazon.com’s success with branded keywords doesn’t stop there. It also makes our list of top 20 keywords for this industry with the popular keywords “amazon prime”, “amazon prime video”, “prime video”, and “amazon uk”. Sure, the ecommerce heavyweight didn’t sweep the board but it came pretty close… Pro tip: Take Amazon’s lead – think about how people search and diversify your keyword strategy. I’ll let you in on a little secret. Bid on your brand name, and on possible misspellings of your brand name to drive the most clicks. Quick quiz. Do you remember if we spell our name “Similarweb” or “Similar web”? People misspell our brand name in 233 main ways. And, we have them all recorded in multiple languages. Now, we don’t bid on all of them but we keep our finger on the pulse. There’s a method to the madness. To drive clicks, you should bid on how people type, misspellings, and all. Pro tip: Bid on misspellings of your brand name also expands your reach by targeting specific keywords related to your most popular business lines. Most clicked paid keywords – ecommerce Keyword Paid Traffic amazon 357,721,907 aliexpress 89,108,811 amazon prime 53,607,906 etsy 35,748,944 shopee 34,957,339 walmart 33,801,159 amazon prime video 26,551,730 ebay 25,093,169 prime video 21,415,479 alibaba 16,248,187 amazon uk 12,935,521 trendyol 11,438,434 flipkart 10,526,442 kohls 10,112,335 lazada 9,330,692 argos 6,990,509 wayfair 6,858,458 magazine luiza 6,291,787 ali express 6,099,856 bed bath and beyond 5,705,712 Top paid lifestyle-related keywords “Shein”, the name of the popular online clothing store, known for its deals, was the most clicked-on PPC term. “Nike” and “Macy’s” round out the top three. Interestingly, one of shein.com’s main competitors, asos.com, had its name “asos” land in 15.
