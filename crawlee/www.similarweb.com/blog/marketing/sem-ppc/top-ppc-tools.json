March 30, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic First things first: a brief PPC 101. Class in session (feel free to skip to the next section if you’ve got this covered). PPC (pay-per-click) advertising is a way to get the right message, in front of the right people, at the right time — by paying an ad platform (Google, Instagram, etc.) a sum for each user that clicks your ad. It’s a lot more targeted than traditional advertising and, if done right, allows your message and product to land in front of people who are far more likely to be interested in it. Your PPC ad can exist in various places online — search engines, other websites, or on social media platforms. That part’s up to you! Why choosing the right PPC tool is so important An excellent PPC approach is the bread and butter of your paid search strategy. If you’re not occupying the right spaces and getting in front of the right eyes, at the right time, you’re missing out on fundamental customer connection and acquisition. That’s where an excellent PPC strategy comes into play. With the right tools, you can change the game. Your time? Saved. Pivotal insights into what your competitors are doing and spending? Gained. Crops? Flourishing. You get it: ROI is robustly increased and you get to create ad content that really lands. Ultimately, the best PPC software is one that inspires you. From lighting up copy or creative to predicting what your target audience is getting excited about. But you’ve got to get your research, planning, and implementation right. That said, combing through every tool option out there can be a pain. So, along with our other PPC and marketing experts here at Similarweb, I’ve hand-picked and curated a list of best-in-class software to make things simpler. The top PPC tools 1. Similarweb (that’s our own horn being tooted). Our platform helps maximize your ROI with razor-sharp, accurate analytics and insights data. When it comes to PPC, here’s what’s crucial: Keyword research tool: uncover the most up-to-date keywords in the world. Expanding into these allows you to increase conversation volume at similar or lower costs than your baseline. Discover a huge range of search terms, and the cost-per-click for each, that your competitors are ranking for. Cue: campaign opportunities and optimization you may not have even considered Ad intelligence tool: random ad tests are a pain. Skip go and save time plus marketing budget by analyzing your competitors’ ads and ad networks (take a shot every time we say ad), as well as landing pages bringing the crowds. Et voila: fine-tune your own creative and copy, and craft highly effective campaigns by analyzing the best practices and strategies. Predict seasonal changes: with unmatched accuracy. Your market’s constantly on the digital move: react to their upcoming needs at the right moment.

SpyFu SpyFu is a great PPC tool for digging into the nitty-gritty. It’s also super user-friendly. Key functions SpyFu’s pièce de résistance is its ad history feature. This gives you the chance to see not only what your competitors are doing, but also have done and how those campaigns performed. Its PPC keyword research features are some of the most comprehensive around: from estimated monthly clicks and specific ad budgets to keywords with the highest CPC or most clicks. SpyFu’s also one of the best PPC platforms when it comes to campaign recommendations. Pricing Basic: $39/month (or $16/annum) Professional: first-month discount of $39, then $79/month (or $36/annum) Team: $299/month (or $149/annum) 3. Unbounce When we say PPC you (possibly, maybe?) say “effective landing pages!”. Enter: Unbounce, a tool that really steps up here. Landing pages that, well, land with your target market are crucial for overall PPC success. Key features From its best-in-class drag-and-drop editor, nifty popups, sticky bars, and over 100 chic templates with multiple conversion best practices built-in, Unbounce earns its eponymous name via its landing page finesse.

Hotjar also includes a Session Recording option: 100 recordings on its base plan and the ability to store 300 of these for a year.

Up to 300M events/month Enterprise: $1667 per month. 5M-1B+ events/month 6. VWO It’s safe to say VWO reigns supreme when it comes to advanced A/B testing (without requiring an advanced skill set). Website optimization should be a consideration every time you’re finessing your PPC strategy. Your ad’s the invite; the landing page is the party. Make it a good one Key features With a UI as intuitive as VWO’s, multivariate testing is a breeze (no, really. The technical-sounding term is the most complicated part). It’s A/B testing on a wider scale: test an unlimited amount of page elements. Plus, add a custom Javascript or CSS to each variation. Another one for the visual folk, VWO’s heatmaps are super effective, too. See exactly how visitors are scrolling on your site, how engaged they are in each section, and (a personal fave) where they stop scrolling. The tool’s clickmaps work similarly: see exactly where visitors are clicking on your site. Use this to gauge which buttons need highlighting, or if certain elements need simplifying. Pricing Starter Pack: free Growth: $357/month Pro: $82/month Enterprise: $1438/month Free 30 days trial (no credit card required). All plans are billed annually. 7. Bonus: ChatGPT It’s the AI on everyone’s tongue (and top Google searches ). While ChatGPT isn’t specifically a PPC tool, it does offer a helpful hand. Here’s a very general example: Key features The Chatbot can stimulate content ideas, be it landing page content or ad copy, and provide insights into keyword trends as well as audience behavior. It can also automate certain aspects of PPC campaigns — think bidding strategies or ad targeting. Let’s ask it directly: Me: Can you help me run successful PPC campaigns? ChatGPT: Yes, I can provide you with some tips on running successful PPC (pay-per-click) campaigns: set clear goals, know your target audience, choose the right keywords and craft compelling ad copy. […] Pricing Pricing’s a little less straightforward for ChatGPT: The AI offers multiple models, each with different abilities and price points. Prices work on a token system and are per 1,000 tokens. Think of tokens as pieces of words: 1,000 tokens equals about 750 words. GPT-4 (one of the offered models coming soon), for instance, costs: Model Prompt Completion 8K context $0.03 / 1K tokens $0.06 / 1K tokens 32K context $0.06 / 1K tokens $0.12 / 1K tokens The best free PPC tools 1. Google Keyword Planner Google Keyword Planner is a no-brainer top PPC tool to add to your box because of its integration with Google Ads (which dominates when it comes to ad platforms).

Providing data prediction that helps you estimate the performance of future campaigns, it includes estimated clicks, CPC, and impressions.

Google Analytics Another elemental tool, Google Analytics connects to your Google Ads account and delivers thorough campaign insights without cutting into your marketing budget. Key features Google Analytics is a must in any serious digital marketer’s kit.
