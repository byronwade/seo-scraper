November 7, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Those top paid spots in search results are hotly contested ðŸ”¥ Your PPC campaignâ€™s success hinges on how well you understand â€˜what clicksâ€™ with your audience â€“ and whether you can turn those clicks into meaningful results for your business. While thereâ€™s no fast-track to success, you can work out whatâ€™s already â€˜clickingâ€™ for your competitors. Uncover how much they spend, which keywords drive the most traffic and what makes their ads so irresistible. With Similarweb as your guide, youâ€™ll learn how to check competitorsâ€™ campaigns for the secrets to a winning PPC strategy. Why should you spy on your competitorsâ€™ PPC campaigns? Every click, every keyword, and every ad you place could make or break your PPC campaign. It can be difficult to know where to begin, leaving you wondering how to get your ads seen â€“ and make them stand out â€“ in search results. Being able to spy on your competitorsâ€™ best-performing campaigns is like having a compass to point you in the right direction. Analyzing your competitorsâ€™ campaigns will help you: Find new opportunities: Pinpoint high-traffic keywords, untapped market opportunities and niches that youâ€™ve previously overlooked or undervalued. Optimize your budget: Learn which keywords, ad placements and seasonality drive the most conversions and revenue. Connect better: Learn more about the customers youâ€™re trying to reach. Competitorsâ€™ campaigns can reveal key demographics, preferences and behaviors of your audience, so you understand what resonates with and spurs them into action. How to check competitorsâ€™ campaigns 1) Find your PPC competitors The first step is finding out who youâ€™re going to be spying on ðŸ”Ž You can do this simply by searching for industry-related and product/service specific keywords on Google to see which ads come up in search results. Then, broaden your search for PPC competitors by searching for long-tail keywords and more specific, niche terms to see if ads from different competitors pop up. This should give you a pretty good idea of who youâ€™re competing against. For an easier way to find your top PPC competitors, thereâ€™s Similarwebâ€™s Paid Competitors tool. Simply type in your website and get a visualization of where you stand in the PPC landscape. Youâ€™ll see your top competitors along with added insight into the degree of overlap between you: You can switch between multiple metrics to see how your view of competitors changes. With the ability to compare total traffic, paid traffic, search overlap and shared keyword percentage, you will have laser-like focus on those you are competing closely with. 2) Identify the traffic leaders Now that youâ€™ve pinpointed the full scope of competitors, you must find out which are getting the biggest share of paid traffic. This will shed light on the paid strategies you should prioritize in your analysis. Check which competitors are driving the most paid traffic using Similarwebâ€™s Paid Search feature. Add in your website along with up to 4 competitors to get an overview of their paid search traffic trends over a specific period: 3) Find out how theyâ€™re doing it Once you know which competitors are driving the most paid traffic, the next step is to discover the ingredients to their success. Whatâ€™s in their winning mix? Here, weâ€™ll go through how you can spy on your competitorsâ€™ best-performing PPC campaigns using Similarwebâ€™s platform. Analyze their PPC Spend Thereâ€™s a lot riding on your budget decisions. Under-spending, overspending or simply some bad timing can lead to less ad visibility and budget down the drain. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so crucial to learn from your competitorsâ€™ spend strategies, so itâ€™s less trial and error and more bang for your buck. Inspect competitorsâ€™ PPC spend to: Reveal how much budget is needed to claim the top paid spots in your industry â€“ a great benchmark and guide for future campaigns Reduce wasted ad spend â€“ when you put budget behind keywords proven to drive traffic, youâ€™ll naturally boost ROI Highlight ad seasonality trends: are they spending more during the holiday season? This could point to when your target audience is more responsive to ads Assess when their ad spend decisions paid off (see how below) In this example, it looks like PPC spend surges between November and December across the entire competitive set. When you compare your competitorsâ€™ PPC spend with their paid traffic trend (next tab along) you will see if that extra ad spend resulted in actual traffic: Here, we can see that Nikeâ€™s extra November ad spend paid off with a spike in traffic, but Adidas spent just as much that month with little reward. From here, you can investigate what Nike did right but also what went wrong with Adidasâ€™ campaign. Dive into their keyword strategy Discovering your competitorsâ€™ most lucrative keywords is the next part of the puzzle. These are the words and phrases consistently driving traffic to their websites. With the right target keywords, you can allocate budget shrewdly, and optimize your ads and landing pages for more clicks and conversions. Find these hidden keyword gems with Similarwebâ€™s PPC Keyword Analyzer feature. Enter in your top competitors, filter by paid traffic and remove branded terms to unlock their high-traffic keywords: Delve deeper with the many metrics on offer. Look into the top keywordsâ€™ search volume, search intent and CPC to help you decide which could have the biggest impact on your own campaigns. Review their ads In the world of PPC, ads are the main event ðŸŒŸ Keywords will get your ads in front of the right eyes, but if your ads fail to catch their attention, it could be all for nothing. Thatâ€™s why you need to analyze your competitorsâ€™ traffic-driving ads to find out what engages your specific audience. Spying on your competitorsâ€™ ads is not about copying them word-for-word, itâ€™s about understanding what resonates with your target audience so you can connect better â€“ even beyond the initial click. Aspects to analyze: Pain points: which problems are being solved/addressed? Tone of voice: how does your audience like to be spoken to? Messaging: what does your audience want to hear? Benefits: what benefits and features are highlighted? CTAs: what encourages your audience to actually click through? Check out our guide on how to spy on your competitorsâ€™ google ads for more info on competitive ad analysis. To find your competitors best performing ads, you can use Similarwebâ€™s Search Ads Analytics feature.

If youâ€™re in the ecommerce world, you can find the product ads driving your competitorsâ€™ shopping campaigns with Similarwebâ€™s Product Ads tool. Here, you can dissect the imagery, ad copy and keywords of their best product ads: Examine their landing pages When it comes to your PPC campaign, you donâ€™t want to fall at the last hurdle. Even with the right target keywords and super clickable ads, youâ€™ve still got to get them to convert once theyâ€™ve clicked through. And thatâ€™s where landing pages come into the mix. Whether your campaign is geared to downloading a guide, filling out a form, booking a discovery call or buying a product, your success could be cut short if your landing page doesnâ€™t meet your audienceâ€™s expectations and needs. So, the final step is analyzing your competitorsâ€™ top performing landing pages and their best practices to extract their best conversion strategies. Hereâ€™s what to analyze: User experience: Check the loading speed, â€˜skimmabilityâ€™ and navigation Design: Find the â€˜wowâ€™ factor on every page Copy: is it relevant, engaging and informative? CTAs: do they use buttons, pop-ups or text? To find your competitorsâ€™ top landing pages, use Similarwebâ€™s Paid Landing Pages Analyzer tool.
