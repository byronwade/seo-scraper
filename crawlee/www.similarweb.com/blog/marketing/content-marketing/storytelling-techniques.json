November 16, 2021 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Once upon a time, there was an agency that started using Similarweb… Okay, okay, we’re not going to get into that story right now. But we are here to discuss a tool you must be using: storytelling. As an agency, you’re always trying to tell your client’s story in a way that makes potential customers want to listen and ultimately convert. A gripping story is not only an authentic and engaging way to inspire sales, it’s what separates mediocre marketing from great marketing, and the memorable from the forgettable. Clearly, storytelling is a powerful tool, and, used alongside agency intelligence, it can drive more engagement, increase your reach, and ensure lasting impact. Here are seven ways to use storytelling throughout your strategy, no matter what your goal. Keep customers hooked with these storytelling strategies Marketing is all about the story. Why? Great storytelling techniques are some of the best methods to make people take action. By telling a story that delivers important lessons or an emotional connection, people are motivated to act. 1. Get personal Ever felt yourself getting teary-eyed at the sight of shelter dogs as the angelic voice of Sarah McLachlan plays in the background? Maybe you were even compelled to donate? Me too. Emotion is a compelling tool that literally moves people – myself included. You may have been told “Write what you know,” and this sage advice applies as much to storytelling as any other writing technique. Look to your own story for inspiration. By drawing from a personal story and your own experience, your content is instantly more relatable and more likely to impact the audience on a personal level. 2. Solve problems Every good story has something at stake. Similarly, every prospect has some problem or need, and you’re here to address it. Painting a clear picture of the issues faced by your audience allows them to feel heard by the storyteller. By pinpointing that problem and explaining how your product or service is the solution, your client becomes the main character – who doesn’t want that? Whether you’re building a presentation, making templates, or posting to social media, focusing on your target audience’s pain points and illustrating to them how your product or service is the answer is a crucial part of the story. 3. Size matters Leave everything that isn’t interesting or relevant behind. At the end of the day, the length of your story matters. While it’s possible to spin a long story (think presentations or lectures), your goal should always be to keep things as succinct as possible, while still including all of the necessary information. The balance between context and content is tough to tackle. You want to hook your reader and keep them in the loop, but not so much that they get bored or lose interest. If you’ve ever heard the expression, “kill your darlings” it applies here. Don’t lose sight of things by getting overly attached to any one part of your story. Edit with discerning eyes and don’t be afraid to make cuts. 4. Show, don’t tell! This is writing 101, but it’s doubly important when it comes to marketing. If you open a book and the author immediately spells out for you what they’re trying to convey, you probably won’t turn another page. Instead, play the long game and you’re more likely to garner camaraderie and trust. A good story has an arc, or a hero’s journey, and should take readers on a ride that both entices and informs, allowing them to make their own conclusions. 5. Keep it real Good storytelling should sound natural. Even if you’re presenting to global CEOs, remember that they’re still people. We’re not fans of fancy language ourselves. So talk to people like they’re people, not companies. Leave the buzzwords and cliche lingo behind and have a conversation. By remaining conversational, your storyline becomes real and relatable. Think about the TED talks that you enjoy watching. What do they have in common? They most likely tell a great story and keep things down to earth. 6. Suspense sells With a massive amount of content constantly competing for their attention, your story needs to nab the audience’s attention. Sprinkling suspense and conflict into your storytelling is a powerful way to keep people interested. The surprise or suspenseful part of the storyline can be in the beginning (like in the movie Clue), somewhere in the middle (like the iconic shower scene in the movie Psycho) or even a twist at the very end (think the Wizard of Oz). The most important part: keep people interested and invested. If everything is predictable in your story, expect audiences to scroll past. 7. Leave them wanting more You know that you need a CTA at the end of all your marketing masterpieces, whether it’s written or spoken. This tells your audience what to do next and how to take action. But when using storytelling methods, be sure to also leave your audience with a message or moral of the story to think about for the rest of the day so they’re more likely to become a returning customer.

The power of storytelling is that it’s a great tool for all marketing materials and even for recruitment. Ads: What entices you to buy something after seeing an ad? Is it a compelling story? One that makes you feel hungry/eager/anxious for more? Using different types of storytelling methods in your ad copy is a great way to keep your audience engaged. About Page on your website: Duh! This is all about the story. Don’t just write the history of the company – dive into the juicy details to keep people from clicking away. Blogs and videos: A blog can be one long story or a series of stories, and use various storytelling techniques throughout. Even integrating one or two of the storytelling methods mentioned into a blog or video makes it that much more engaging. Recruiting: More and more companies are using storytelling techniques to recruit new top talent. By telling the stories of current employees, they’re able to attract new people who want the story for themselves. Looking for more tools to amplify your impact?
