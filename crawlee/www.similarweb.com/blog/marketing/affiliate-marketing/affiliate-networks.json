If you’re a publisher looking for partners, using an affiliate network can be the quickest path to earning a commission. We’re about to cover the essentials to start using affiliate networks, so grab your notebooks, folks! We’ll run through the basics, show you how affiliate networks work, and finish off with a list of the top affiliate networks out there for you to join. Let’s get started. What is an affiliate network? An affiliate network is a website or app which lets advertisers find publishers who can promote content to their target audiences. Publishers participating in affiliate networks are known as affiliates. Advertisers participating in affiliate networks may be merchants or ad agencies representing merchants. Generally speaking, this is a win-win-win situation for all parties involved. Advertisers receive access to affiliates’ promotional resources, enabling them to sell more products and services while avoiding the time and labor it would take to locate affiliate partners manually. At the same time, affiliates earn commissions while enjoying efficient access to advertisers without having to invest resources in locating them. Affiliate network providers earn fees from advertisers and, in some cases, from affiliates as well. See? Win-win-win – and what’s there not to love about that? How affiliate networks work Publishers and advertisers must register for each network. Registration is subject to an approval process to prevent fraud and comply with regulations and policies. Once approved, publishers fill out profiles and receive access to directories of advertisers and products matching designated criteria, like industry information. Approved advertisers receive a listing in these directories. And here, publishers and advertisers can begin forming partnerships. Affiliate network platforms facilitate partnerships between publishers and advertisers by providing tools, including: Dashboards for account management and affiliate program management Profile databases to match publishers with advertisers Marketing tools, such as affiliate links which can be embedded in the content Sales tracking tools, such as unique IDs assigned to publishers and associated cookies Reporting tools to document sales Payment processing for affiliate commissions Resources such as tutorials and blog posts on how to succeed in affiliate marketing, covering topics such as affiliate marketing strategies, best niches for affiliate marketing, and influencer strategies The cookies that are used to track affiliate sales last a set length of time before expiring. These tend to be either 30, 60, 90, or 120 days. Advertisers who participate in affiliate networks pay commissions to publishers, as well as fees to affiliate network service providers. Depending on the policy of the affiliate network, these fees can include costs for registration, subscriptions, and fees per sale. Some affiliate networks charge fees to publishers as well. The difference between affiliate networks and affiliate programs Affiliate networks differ from conventional affiliate programs in four main ways: Traditional affiliate programs are set up directly between merchants and affiliates, without the use of a third party. Participants in standard affiliate programs must seek out partners manually and one at a time. In conventional affiliate programs, any marketing or sales tracking tools are provided by the merchant, who is responsible for their administration, without any third-party oversight. Traditional affiliate programs are more vulnerable to fraud than affiliate networks. As these differences suggest, affiliate networks enjoy some advantages in automated efficiency, transparency, and security over traditional affiliate programs. However, both approaches can be profitable, and you can use both together to earn money. Top affiliate networks What are today’s best affiliate networks?
