June 8, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Your affiliate partners aren’t exclusive to you. It’s the nature of affiliate marketing to share them with other brands. As long as they bring in steady revenue and the ROI is good, you’re O.K. with that. You monitor their performance and are aware of what they are doing. But so does the competition. They know who your affiliate partners are, how much traffic they generate to your site, and how they do it. If competitors like what they see, you can be sure that they don’t sit back and watch you gobble up the cream by yourself. Competitors want their share, and they are after your best affiliates. It’s the best way for them to find their own affiliate partners. In this article, we’ll show you how your competitors investigate your affiliate marketing activities. You can’t stop them, but you can keep your competitive edge by monitoring the affiliate landscape in your industry and in general. You can see what everyone else is doing, who’s winning, and who’s losing, and find the best affiliate partners to keep developing and optimizing more profitable affiliate partnerships. First, let’s see what affiliate marketing means for the partners involved. What are affiliate partnerships and what are they worth? Affiliate partnerships can be a long-term mutually-beneficial cooperation. As an affiliate manager you know how important it is to nurture those relationships. But you also need to keep an eye on those hungry competitors lest they steal your best partners. Affiliate marketing involves three or four parties: The seller or vendor, the publisher or affiliate, and the customer. Sometimes there’s an affiliate network involved. When we talk about affiliate partnerships, we refer to the cooperation between vendor and affiliate. The vendor can be a brand, a retailer, or a merchant – basically, anyone who has something to sell online. That’s you. You’re in good company. In 2021, more than 80% of brands worked with affiliate partners. 65% of merchants report that up to 20% of their revenue comes from affiliate marketing. The affiliate is a company or individual who publishes content to promote your brand or offering. For many, it’s a core business, and they are a trusted, well-known source of traffic for multiple brands in an industry. One statistic says 65% of affiliate marketers are bloggers; another reveals that 68% connect with customers over social media. In an affiliate partnership, both sides benefit. For the brand, it means expanding reach and saving resources. The affiliate receives compensation for the service they provide. Because payment is performance-based, the seller has relatively low risk. It’s estimated that affiliate marketing is worth $12 billion globally. The biggest player is America, with a share of 39%. There’s an affiliate partner type for each business Affiliates come in many shapes and sizes, and each industry has its preference regarding the type. Today, most people think of influencers when they hear affiliate marketing. But that’s because influencer affiliate marketing is the current fad of growing eCommerce. The truth is, there’s so much more to affiliate marketing, and it reaches a lot further than most people think. How do we immediately know that Jenn Im in this video is an affiliate? Check out what she says about the video, right underneath. She names a sponsor and offers a coupon code for their site. Previously, affiliate marketing was mainly associated with fin-tech and gaming. These sites use mostly search affiliates who run paid search and display campaigns for the vendors. Technology companies often partner with bloggers and review sites that publish informative content to a specific, relevant target audience with a high focus on generating organic traffic. Example of an affiliate site that tests, reviews and ranks VPN services. ECommerce sites use coupon sites and loyalty sites as affiliate partners. Influencers’ product reviews and shopping comparisons have also become popular for many online sellers. Media outlets are great platforms for anyone needing to reach a broad audience or offering local services.
