September 20, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Trending keywords are (quite literally) all the rage. They inspire content your audience will be dying to read while also breathing new life into your evergreen content. The thing with keyword trends is that to capitalize on them, you have to catch them early. By the time they reach their peak, everybody is fighting to win a higher share of organic traffic. So, being the first to notice – and take action on – a trend is a huge advantage. For example, with the rise of artificial intelligence, forward-thinking brands like Canva have quickly jumped on skyrocketing keyword trends like ‘ai image generator’ which is now one of their top 10 traffic driving keywords. They acted quickly and developed a free AI image generator tool, and are now the traffic winner for these and other related trending keywords – positioning themselves as a leader in the AI image generation space. A pretty powerful place to be when AI is only just beginning to shape the world around us. How to find trending SEO keywords The best place to start finding trending keywords is to use a keyword tool. It will help you understand how your target audience searches and what’s causing buzz in your industry right now. Similarweb, with its extensive, rich keyword database – which has billions of keywords, and counting – is one of the best platforms out there for discovering the hottest keywords. Here’s how to find trending keywords using Similarweb: Keyword Generator Begin by inputting a seed keyword or a list of potential keywords into the keyword generator. With access to 6 billion relevant keywords, you’ll instantly get a comprehensive list of relevant, fresh, and targeted keywords around this topic. Next, pay attention to the “Trending Keywords” section. See which related keywords have seen a significant uplift in traffic in the last 28 days to capture growing interest before your competitors do. In this example from Similarweb’s platform, we see that timeless Mary Jane shoes are back in style this season, but there’s an even bigger, unexpected rise in searches for ‘tabi shoes’ – a specific Japanese style shoe. Also, looking at the Yearly Trend shows which months the keyword is trending the most so you publish/update content at the right time. Keywords by Industry Another great way to discover trending keywords, particularly in a niche, is to search for keywords by industry – another feature within our Keyword Research tool. Select a relevant industry and narrow down by country to see a list of keywords for your audience based in different regions. You can then filter by ‘trending terms’ and ‘newly discovered keywords’ to get an extensive list of new and upcoming keywords that are super relevant within that specific industry. Why fresher is better Similarweb’s Keyword Generator is a great example of how fresh data can make all the difference. It’s the only keyword tool out there that gives you search volume data from the last 28 days. Here you can see that Similarweb has picked up on several early emerging keyword trends in September – from Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner’s shock split to the arrest of YouTuber Mom, Ruby Franke. Having the freshest keyword data at your fingertips enables you to be the first to detect new trending keywords in your industry or your geographical region. If your keyword research tool isn’t able to provide timely, precise data, you’ll find keywords that are no longer relevant. So, the number one thing to remember when learning how to find current trending keywords is that the value of a tool’s output depends on the data quality. Make sure you use tools, like Similarweb’s Keyword Generator, that provide up-to-date insights and fresh, precise data. Let’s take a step back before we move on. Ask yourself: why do you even need data? Isn’t it enough to know there’s a buzz about a keyword? Here are three great reasons: Not everything that everybody talks about will also drive traffic If it’s a passing trend, it may be gone by the time you’ve created content, and you’ll never be the first to pick up on a trend Even when there are no apparent fads, you still need to identify what’s trending So, after you identify topic trends, feed the related keywords into a keyword tool to conduct in-depth keyword research. Competitor’s trending keywords The next step is to plug any gaps. For this, you might use a keyword gap tool (we’ve got one of those, too, luckily) to find what keywords competitors are targeting and leverage their potential. You can also check a competitor’s traffic share to see very quickly which key terms and topics you are missing on your website. For those who want to be the first to catch on to trends, gaps that existed three months ago or only may exist now are irrelevant. Trends and fads are only relevant if you catch them on the rise and as early as possible. Similarweb keyword gap delivers data from the last seven days and guarantees the highest data freshness. Here, using CNN as an example, you’ll see that when compared with other competing news outlets, Similarweb’s last 7-day view has highlighted gaps with keywords as fresh as ‘hurricane lee’ and ‘danny masterson’. Both keywords refer to breaking news in the first week of September. Next up, we’ll look at some other tools that will help you discover the latest SEO trends.

Most tools show data from all sectors, and if a trend isn’t impacting all industries, you may be missing out. With Similarweb, you can select the time frame to view and get data from the specific week, month, or period you choose. How to find recurring keyword trends with keyword seasonality Data granularity is critical when dealing with trends. Trends are everywhere all the time, so finding trending keywords can’t just be limited to fads and passing fashions.

Some keywords have seasonalities and are more popular during specific periods, like keywords related to sporting events. With Similarweb’s keyword seasonality tool, you can quickly identify when search volume is high. Where does data come from? Google is for data what Walmart is for groceries. You can find a little bit of everything there, and it’s accessible to anyone. But when you need something a bit more specific, or if you are looking for top quality, well, there are better places to look. It’s the same with data. Google isn’t a sufficient data supplier.
