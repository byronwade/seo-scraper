October 3, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic When keyword research forms the bedrock of your SEO, PPC, and content strategies, choosing the right keyword research tool couldn’t be more important. Google’s Keyword Planner and Similarweb’s Keyword Generator are two of the very best keyword tools out there. Here, we’ll decipher the differences between the two so you can choose the keyword tool best suited to the specific needs and goals of your business What is the difference between Google’s Keyword Planner vs. Similarweb’s Keyword Generator? Google’s Keyword Planner tool is part of Google Ads. It’s designed to help advertisers find keywords relevant to their business and provides keyword ideas, search volume trends, and estimates on ad spend. Similarweb’s Keyword Generator tool helps marketers discover relevant keywords, and offers insights into organic and paid search volume, cost-per-click (CPC) values, and keyword competition levels. Both keyword tools are useful for any marketer wanting to conduct keyword research. Using either, you can generate relevant keywords based on seed words, build keyword lists, and watch how a set of keywords performs. The key difference is that Google’s tool is seen as an accessible starting point for keyword research: familiar and straightforward. Similarweb’s keyword tool, on the other hand, allows for much more depth of analysis with the many keyword metrics and filters available. Similarweb’s Keyword Generator vs. Google’s Keyword Planner Google’s Keyword Planner The pros and cons of using Google’s Keyword Planner: ✅ User Friendly The user-friendly design of Google’s Keyword Planner makes it a very popular SEO tool, particularly for those new to the game and wanting some basic keyword insights. ✅ Multiple Seed Keywords You can input up to 10 seed keywords to begin your search. For example, if you’re running a small online bookstore, you could start with seed keywords like “bestsellers 2023,” “science fiction books,” and “online bookshop” and have a great foundation to start building your content strategy. ✅ Search Volume and Traffic Estimates Google Keyword Planner offers both search volume and traffic estimates for keywords. These metrics give you a snapshot of how many people are searching for a specific keyword and its estimated traffic. ✅ It’s Free! One of the best things about Google’s Keyword Planner is that it’s free to use. It’s a good entry point for newcomers to SEO and content creation who don’t yet have the budget for premium tools. ❌ Limited Keywords You’re limited to 10 seed keywords, and from those, you’ll get a finite list of keyword suggestions (usually in the hundreds.) While this may be fine for smaller campaigns and niches, it doesn’t help marketers who want to carry out deeper, more comprehensive research. For example, if you want to understand all the keyword opportunities around a larger topic like “headphones,” the output will be limited. ❌ Broad Search Volume While it’s definitely helpful to know general search volume, Google only provides it in broad ranges or buckets, such as “1K-10K” monthly searches. This makes it pretty difficult to gauge the actual popularity of a keyword. A keyword with 1,500 monthly searches will need different SEO tactics than one with 9,000 per month, but with Google’s tool, they would both fall into the same bucket. ❌ No Device Data Google’s keyword tool does not consider nuanced user behavior across different devices. A keyword might perform well on desktop but badly on mobile, and you wouldn’t be able to tell using this tool. Speaking of premium tools, let’s dive into…. Similarweb’s Keyword Generator The pros and cons of using Similarweb’s Keyword Generator: ✅ Super Fresh Data One of the standout features of Similarweb’s Keyword Generator is its real-user, real-time data. You’ll have access to fresh keyword data based on the last 28 days. Having the freshest data in the market at your fingertips means capitalizing on fast-moving trends while they’re still relevant, so you stay several steps ahead of the competition. For example, if there’s a sudden surge in searches for “electric cars” due to recent news, Similarweb would capture this change much faster than any other keyword tool. Our keyword data is updated weekly, even daily on some features! Just last week, Taylor Swift launched a series of 89 anagram puzzles on Google to promote the re-release of her album ‘1989’, which fans could only access by typing her name into the Google search bar. You’ll see that keyword data for ‘taylor swift 1989 (taylor’s version), ‘taylor swift puzzle’ and ‘taylor swift vault puzzle’ is already showing up on the platform. It doesn’t get fresher than that! ✅ Unlimited Keywords Similarweb doesn’t put a cap on your keyword curiosity. You can explore an extensive list of keyword suggestions, as the database boasts billions of keywords (with more added every day!) This is particularly helpful for digging deep into larger topics as well as sub-niches and categories within your market. ✅ Accurate Search Volume Similarweb offers precise search volume, based on real-user data from multiple sources across several countries, which is rigorously vetted and impeccably accurate. Instead of vague search volume buckets, you’ll know that “iced coffee” has 14,420 searches per month in the US and 10,490 in the UK. You’re also provided with the most accurate website traffic estimations for each keyword. ✅ Added Value Keyword Data Besides basic search volume, you’ll get a whole host of other super valuable metrics, like keyword difficulty, zero-click searches (when a query is answered directly on the search results page, resulting in no clicks to other content), and search intent (informational, transactional, navigational, etc.) These added insights could influence not just what you write about but how you structure and optimize your content. ✅ Keyword Categorizations The Keyword Generator categorizes keyword suggestions into different types such as phrase match, related keywords, trending keywords, and question-based queries. Understanding the type of query can be really useful when developing your content strategy. For example, if you find that “Is iced coffee better?” is a trending question, you could quickly publish a blog post targeting it. ✅ Mobile and Desktop Data Knowing how keywords perform across different devices can be a game-changer. Similarweb offers separate data sets for mobile and desktop searches, allowing for a laser-focused keyword strategy. ❌ Not Free While Similarweb offers a richer dataset and many more features on top of the Keyword Generator, it’s a paid subscription. However, for businesses and marketers looking for an all-in-one, full-scope SEO tool, it’s certainly a worthwhile investment.
