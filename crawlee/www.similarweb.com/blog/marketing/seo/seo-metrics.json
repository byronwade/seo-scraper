May 30, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic In SEO, the challenge isn’t a lack of data. On the contrary. You often have too much of it. You’re faced with choosing the right metrics to analyze and determining what you (and your company or clients) need to know. And that’s sometimes the tricky part. This article will help you understand which metrics are critical and why. You’ll also learn how to measure each one. Let’s dive right in. SEO metrics: what are they, and why do they matter? SEO metrics are the data points that allow you to evaluate your SEO efforts and reach optimization decisions. They also enable you to detect changes, spot opportunities, and identify errors. The metrics you choose to track depend on your website and SEO goals. However, there are some core metrics that every SEO manager should always monitor. Also, keep in mind that some SEO metrics aren’t valuable when you look at them in isolation. You’ll only get useful insights when viewing them in relation to other SEO metrics. Keep reading to find out which crucial SEO metrics to consistently monitor, what weekly SEO metrics you should measure, and which to track monthly. I’ll also discuss the importance of the various metrics for SEO. 9 SEO important metrics 1. Keyword rankings What is it? When you optimize a page for a specific keyword, your goal is to rank as high as possible on the SERP (Search Engine Results Page). Keyword ranking refers to your page’s position on the SERP for a specific keyword search. Why should you measure it? Keyword ranking is probably the most straightforward SEO metric. It’s an almost direct measure of how successfully you’ve optimized a page for a keyword. Almost, because domain authority, E-E-A-T factors, and other non-keyword-related ranking factors also impact where your content ranks. Optimization to increase ranking is a process you must track as it takes time. In addition, once you’ve reached a rank you’re satisfied with, you need to hold on to it. That’s a good reason to measure so you can detect changes and deviations frequently. How do you measure and monitor? You can view the keywords and pages your site is ranking for in Google Search Console. However, the search query data is incomplete, and the dashboard is limited. Considering the importance of this metric, you should use a rank tracking tool such as the Similarweb platform. The tool allows you to create keyword groups using tags to easily monitor progress, detect trends, and discover topics. You can organize your reports by search volume to understand better how competitive a keyword is or by keyword difficulty to prioritize further and assess keyword challenges. View ranking changes over time and track how competitors’ pages rank for the same one or set of keywords. With Similarweb, you get everything you need to pinpoint issues to focus on and set your SEO priorities. Choose Rank Tracker and then Keywords to access your data. Tracking the ranking of your core SEO keywords should be a daily routine. Simlarweb presents a long range of data, so you can always see the progress. 2. Organic Traffic What is it? Organic traffic refers to the traffic your site receives from organic clicks. It is the part of your site traffic you receive through the SERP without paying as you would in PPC or display ads. Why should you measure it? Increasing organic traffic is usually the number one purpose of SEO. As we’ve seen, ranking is important; the better the ranking, the higher your chances of increasing traffic. (You also need to consider CTR, but that’s the next point.) You want to track organic traffic to all your pages to gauge their performance. Investigate why pages are gaining or losing and which need optimizing. Also, comparing your traffic to the market and your top competitors helps you assess how you measure up. You get a visual breakdown of the traffic share among the top websites (or the ones you select) followed by a detailed table. How to measure organic traffic? You can measure your sitewide traffic in Google Analytics. You can find page-specific data by digging into the tool. GSC provides basic data about organic clicks, but it’s best to conduct a deeper analysis. For example, benchmark against the competition to understand the context and value of positive measures. This is another crucial SEO metric to monitor daily. To do that, you need a more advanced tool like Similarweb. The platform delivers fresh, verified web traffic data to help you analyze digital market activity. You can view your traffic data in context, benchmark against industry or individual competitors, and easily monitor the entire organic search landscape relevant to your business. The view below allows you to analyze your competitive organic landscape as the metric. Select the parameters for the y-axis and the x-axis to understand your position. 3. Organic click-through rate What is it? The organic click-through rate shows the percentage of people who clicked on your URL after seeing it on the SERP. It divides the total impressions by the number of clicks to your page. Why should you measure it? You want to know how many people who found your page also clicked through to get to its content. A large percentage of searchers clicking your URL on the SERP is a sign you’ve convinced them that your page content answers their query. But what’s considered a large percentage? There’s a clear correlation between ranking and CTR. The first position has the highest average CTR, and the percentage gradually decreases with each rank. Different tools will provide you with different numbers, which vary significantly. This is because other factors, such as type of industry, zero-click searches, SERP features, and search intent, impact the average click-through rate per rank. We’ve taken several statistics and developed an average range that you can use as a benchmark. Check your page’s ranking and CTR against the numbers displayed. If you reach a significantly lower percentage of click-throughs, you need to investigate why. A low CTR can have many reasons. Here’s what you should check: Check if your meta tags (title and meta description) align with SEO guidelines and ask yourself if they encourage the user to click on the search result. Compare to other sites and check how you improve meta tags, for example, with a clear call-to-action. Check the search intent. You might be targeting a keyword with a different search intent. The searcher may stop clicking because your content doesn’t respond to the intent. Identify zero-click searches. Zero-click searches are queries answered within the SERP, meaning the searcher doesn’t click on any result. A high percentage of zero clicks for a keyword leads to a low CTR. You want to know this in advance to align your strategy. How do you measure it? Measuring click-through rate is part of your daily SEO monitoring. You’ll find the average CTR for a specific page or keyword in Google Search Console. In Similarweb Digital Marketing Intelligence, you can also find data on zero-click searches, search intent, and SERP results.

The organic conversion rate represents the percentage of organic visitors who take the next step you want them to take. It’s essentially an action taken on the website, and it differs per business. The most common examples are signing up, making a purchase, or filling in a form. Why should you measure it? For many marketers, the organic conversion rate is the number one metric that measures the efficiency of their digital marketing efforts. A low conversion rate signals that your content or product page needs to be more convincing or that you need to work on your audience targeting. In terms of SEO, conversion rate helps you gauge the relevance of your keywords and the searcher’s intent compared to what you offer. How to measure conversion rate? To measure conversion rate, you’ll set up event tracking and specify goals in Google Analytics so the tool can measure and track conversions effectively. Monitor it weekly or monthly, depending on your business type and the page’s importance. Ecommerce companies monitor even more frequently but may not do so in GA. Large revenue-generating websites often have custom dashboards that allow them to track and monitor crucial metrics in the best way possible. 5. Core web vitals – CWV What is it? Core web vitals are a set of factors Google looks at to assess overall user experience. Providing excellent user experience is one of Google’s top priorities. The search engine rewards pages that load fast, especially on mobile. These metrics are used for evaluation: First Contentful Paint (FCP) – Measures the first point on the page-load timeline where the user can see anything on the screen. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) – Measures the time it takes for the largest image or text block to become visible. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) – Measures visual stability by quantifying how often a layout shift occurs. First Input Delay (FID) – Measures load responsiveness, the time it takes for the browser to begin processing an event. Time to Interactive (TTI) – Measures the time it takes for a page to become fully interactive. Total Blocking Time (TBT) – Measures the total time from FCP to TTI. Why should you measure it? Core Web Vitals are confirmed by Google ranking factors. That’s a straightforward reason for every SEO to keep a close eye on them. On a more holistic note, measurement can show you areas to improve the overall user experience on your site. How to measure it? You can obtain a CWV report under “Experience” in Google Search Console or use Google’s Page Speed Insights tool for individual pages. Depending on your website and business type, you can check weekly or monthly. The tool also shows if your CWVs are ‘good’, ‘need improvement’, or ‘poor’. The Similarweb Site Audit tool includes a Page Speed report to help you diagnose and optimize your site’s Core Web Vitals. You can access all of your page speed issues from the Page Speed Overview dashboard through the following: Page Speed Score Page Speed Health Score Errors Top Changes Slow Performance Pages If you click on any of the error reports, you are redirected to a page dedicated to optimizing that error. The page includes a help section that explains: What the issue is What typically causes it How to fix it What the positive impact will be if you fix it You can also access all of the URLs with the issues. 6. Search visibility What is it? Search visibility measures how visible to the user your page is on the SERP. A high keyword ranking alone no longer ensures your page gets traffic. SERP features, such as a knowledge panel, product listing, or Instant answers, often push the top-ranking results below the fold. And users rarely scroll down. Why should you measure it? The keyword rank doesn’t indicate how easy it is for people to find your page. Search visibility helps overcome the challenge of evaluating that and provides a clearer picture. How to measure it? Measuring search visibility is the task of a rank-tracking tool. Rank Ranger’s Absolute Visibility metric calculates a page’s visibility on the SERP based on three factors: Where is it ranking? Are there SERP features on the SERP? Is it above or below the fold? On the visibility graph, you can clearly see the fluctuation in the visibility of your page on the SERP. The table provides you with the relevant data. 7. Referring domains What is it? Referring domains are the unique websites that link back to your site, regardless of the number of individual backlinks from each. For instance, if example.com and blog.example.com link to your site, they would be two referring domains. The count is regardless of how many individual links each domain sends to your site. If you have 2 links from example.com and 12 links from blog.example.com – they would still count as two referring domains. Why should you measure it? Identifying and analyzing referring domains lets you assess the relevance and quality of the sites that send you traffic. Google considers these, and so should you. Monitoring referring domains lets you unveil “bad” websites and keywords you prefer not to be associated with. You can upload a list of these pages to GSC that you don’t want Google to recognize as “recommendations”. The metric can also be useful in discovering what caused an increase in keyword ranking. For example, you might need to check the referring domains and backlinks for these keywords to see if other websites are linked to the page you are promoting. How to measure it? You can measure referring domains with a backlinks analytics tool. For instance, the Similarweb backlink checker includes: A backlinks report A referring domains report The Referring Domains report shows you a list of domains linking to your site, including metrics such as: A Domain Trust Score (DTS) The number of backlinks pointing from the domain to your site The number of Dofollow and Nofollow links from the domain 8. Indexed pages What is it? Indexed pages show how many of your domain’s URLs are indexed by Google. A page that isn’t indexed will not appear on a SERP, as search engines don’t actually search the web. In reality, they search their index on the web. There might be two reasons your pages aren’t indexed: You’ve chosen not to index them They are not indexed due to technical issues or error Why should you measure it? Monitoring your page indexation is critical, as unindexed pages are invisible to search engines. Page indexing could directly affect your organic traffic, and regular monitoring is key for visibility and effective SEO. How to measure it? With site audit tools. Google Search Console informs you of the number of indexed and non-indexed pages per day. The tool also gives you the reason why a page isn’t indexed. If you want more details, the Similarweb Indexability report in the Site Audit tool will help you diagnose any and all issues on your site. You can see big-picture metrics such as: An indexability score Indexability health score errors You can see all of the indexing errors on your site. If you click on any of the errors, you are redirected to a detailed report that explains what causes the issue, how you fix it, and what the impact is. You can find the tool here: Site Audit>SEO>Indexability 9. Crawl Stats What is it? Search engines frequently crawl your site, but you can’t know exactly which pages, when, and how often. Crawl stats measure the crawling activity on your site in two parameters: Crawl requests: The search engine’s total number of crawl requests in the given period. Response time: The average time it takes for a page to respond to a crawl request and retrieve the content. Why should you measure it? You might identify a pattern. For example, the search engine might focus on a particular page template and crawl them more often than others. This is something you want to be aware of so you can improve these pages and possibly rank higher. How to measure it? You already guessed the answer: Google Search Console has the information. The Similarweb Site Audit tool includes a detailed crawl budget report that will help you diagnose and fix any crawl budget issues your site may have. If you want more detail, you can upload summary data from log file analyzer tools. By doing this, you will be able to see: All the pages that are not receiving requests from search engine bots How frequently your pages are receiving bot requests The craw frequency of your site maps Crawl budget efficiency Other metrics for SEO – how significant are they? Bounce rate What is it? Bounce rate measures the percentage of visitors that arrive at your site but leave without taking any additional action. Should you measure it? Bounce rate varies between industries, niches, and even page types, and as long as you’re within the normal range, you’re doing OK. Monitoring bounce rates can help you identify page errors. In combination with other engagement metrics, marketers can analyze how visitors behave. However, for SEO, the metric is not a top priority. How to measure bounce rate? You can find the information in Google Analytics. However, GA does not provide information about what’s ‘normal’. To benchmark against others and to correlate with other engagement metrics, a keyword research tool like Similarweb provides a lot more valuable information. Commercial sites check engagement metrics weekly; others are OK with measuring monthly. Similarweb also lets you compare your engagement metrics with your competitors’ side-by-side. Average session duration What is it? The metric shows the average time visitors spend on your site from the moment they arrive until they exit. Should you measure it? Similar to bounce rate, average session duration normalcy depends on either industry, website, or page type. If visitors spend less time on your site than your competitors, you want to know why. Whether session duration is valuable for you to measure regularly depends on what your site offers and what your business goal is. SaaS companies and subscription sites may find this insightful because it helps them understand whether users value their service. Likewise, ecommerce marketplaces may be interested in visitors browsing through their categories – and, hopefully, buying more. You should measure it with other engagement metrics, such as the number of pages visited, visit duration, and bounce rate. For SEO, the metric is less critical because it doesn’t provide direct insights about the SEO quality of your content. How to measure it? Like bounce rate, you get the average session duration with Similarweb Traffic Analytics. Under all traffic, choose channels and then look at organic search. The tool provides a breakdown per keyword and landing page, including bounce rate and average session duration. To understand user behavior, you’ll need a more comprehensive set of engagement metrics and more analytics from tools like Similarweb. Exit rate What is it? Exit rate measures the percentage of visitors that leave your domain from a specific page. Should you measure it? Some businesses like to track the exit rate to identify where the visitor’s journey ends. It can be interesting for ecommerce sites to monitor the exit rate at the payment gate. The true value for SEO is debatable. Nevertheless, it’s important to understand visitor behavior. How to measure it? You can find the number of exits from a page on Google Analytics. Then, calculate the average exit rate by dividing the number of exits by the number of pageviews for the page in question. Tools to track SEO metrics Let’s summarize which tracking tools can help you achieve your various goals: Google Search Console Google Search Console is the primary tool to measure the key metrics for your SEO success. It’s a free platform that provides data about organic activity on your domain. On GSC, you can check most elementary metrics, such as keyword ranking, organic click-through rate, indexed pages, and Crawl Stats. You can also find CWV and page experience reporting in the enhanced section. Google Analytics Google Analytics is useful for getting insights on other traffic channels besides organic. With this tool, you can also investigate engagement metrics and some metrics that are SEO critical, such as details about organic traffic volume, bounce rate, average session duration, and more. You can track goal completion, such as purchases and products added to a cart. And it helps uncover audience demographics. Similarweb Similarweb Digital Marketing Intelligence has a wide range of tools to analyze organic traffic and SEO metrics. The platform lets you dig into your website’s performance within the context of your market. You can see the traffic metrics of any of your competitors, your industry, and the entire web. The same goes for engagement and audience demographic insights. What does this mean? Most SEO metrics alone don’t tell you much. So, you’ve increased your organic traffic for a specific keyword over the past three months by 5%. Is that good? Or are you actually losing the game because your top competitors gained +10%? And that’s just one example where looking at your isolated SEO metrics doesn’t have much value. Take your SEO to the next step Google has many ranking factors, most of which are not publicized (at least the ones that haven’t yet leaked). If you were to measure them all to ensure your website is perfectly optimized, you’d probably get more confusion than clarity. But when you focus on the high-level metrics for SEO explained here and dive into a competitive analysis, you’ll uncover opportunities and threats to your SEO strategy. And that’s really the point of monitoring, right?
