globally A list is a list, but what interesting facts and stats can we draw out from that top 100 most-asked questions on Google in 2023? Answer: loads. 1) Looking into search intent What do we want? ANSWERS. When do we want them? NOW. We all say Google has the answer to everything, and the questions you ask it are answered at a rapid rate too. Especially when SERP features get involved. Whatever search terms are plugged into search engines like Google, there will be some form of search intent. When it comes to question queries in particular, people are looking for answers, meaning the search intent is – almost always – informational. In the most-asked questions in 2023, you’ll find most of them are ‘How to’ questions. In fact, ‘How to’ questions take up 52% of the top 100. You’ll find ‘how to tie a tie’ at #5, which is always quite high-up. The global traffic leader for this search term is (predictably) YouTube – because who wants to read a step-by-step of how you tie a tie? A lot of the other ‘How to’s are tech-related; something for tech brands to consider in their content strategy to win more traffic and improve the customer experience. ‘What is’ questions also take up a mighty 19% of the top 100 most-asked questions on Google last year, including: what is (4) what is chatgpt (12) what is temu (13) what is chat gpt (17) what is a cover letter (25) what is hamas (32) what is api (35) what is the weather today (37) what is threads (46) what is discord (49) what is sql (52) what is the weather (53) what is devops (58) what is github (63) what is telegram (64) what is cloud computing (65) what is sap (71) what is aws (94) Again, ‘what is’ implies an informational search intent. It might be a trend you’ve never heard of, it might be another acronym mentioned in a meeting, it might be reassurance you’re doing something right, and it might be something complicated and totally-unrelated to your day to day. Whatever it is, these people want quick answers, quickly. That’s why SERP features are so sought-after. By optimizing your website and your content, you can win more SERP features to be top of the search results, and highlighted as the top information-provider. That’s great for your search visibility and engagement, as well as your brand awareness. Learn all about the most popular SERP features and how to find those opportunities 2) Costs in a cost-conscious world Speaking of informational intent via question queries, some questions are a lot more product or service-specific. And if they’re mentioning your product or even your field of expertise, who better to provide that information than you? In the top 100 most-asked questions, you’ll find 6% of them start with “how much”. This leads us nicely onto the importance of pricing pages – or at least providing price brackets – for all kinds of businesses. Much like the recruitment movement of including salary bands in job ads, you should be providing pricing for your product or service on your website, where it’s easy to find. Why? Attracting the right customers in for your business Improving customer experience all-round That’s right; it goes two ways. You don’t waste your time by casting your net too wide, including audiences that aren’t able to afford your business, and you don’t waste your prospects’ or customers’ time either. This creates a level of trust, and while the prospect might not be able to pay now, they’ll know the ballpark that they need to work to, and could come back to you at a later date. Salespeople, having a base pricing can give you leverage when it comes to deals and discounts to convert those clients (if needed). 3) A new era of privacy We’ve all been preparing ourselves for a cookieless future, and saying goodbye to the days of using third-party cookies to track user behavior and enable targeted advertising (and hello to the art of collecting first-party data). But here’s a question: Are we also looking at a social media-less future? Judging by the most-asked questions on Google in 2023, yes. Here’s what you can find in the top 100 questions alone: how to delete instagram account (3) how to deactivate instagram (6) how to deactivate facebook (7) how to delete facebook account (8) how to deactivate instagram account (14) how to change name on facebook (20) how to delete twitter account (22) how to deactivate facebook account (45) how to disable instagram account (55) how to delete facebook page (76) how to delete a facebook page (80) Also in the mix was ‘how to change name on facebook’ (20) – these searchers might be changing their name after marriage, or they might be making themselves and their personal information harder to find. Looking at our keyword analysis tool, we can see that the search term “how to delete facebook” had a huge surge in summer this year. The benefits of quitting social media have been talked about for many years, and it looks like those benefits are being heard and acted on now. While ‘how to delete linkedin account’ is in the list (118), it appears that the main focus is the more personal social media accounts, with Twitter’s traffic decline regularly reported throughout 2023. In swooped Threads in July 2023 to save the day of those that just had to write down their streams of consciousness for the world to see. Threads was initially well received, reaching 100 million users in just five days. Within a month, usage was down 79%. This steep decline compliments the fact that Threads only has one mention in the most-searched-for questions in 2023 – that question being: ‘what is threads’ (46). The traffic distribution of the phrase “threads meta”, showing its short-lived success. Nice try, Zuckerberg. Maybe next time. What were the most Googled questions in 2023, in the US? Again, we’re letting you in on the top 100 most-searched questions on Google – this time, in the US.

taking a look at the whole year of 2023, we’re seeing four seasons worth of question queries. Within four seasons, there are a lot of calendar dates you (as a business) want to keep in mind year on year. Sometimes, dates change or our memories get the better of us, and that shows in the most-searched questions for 2023: when is daylight savings (4) when is black friday (11) when are taxes due (13) when are taxes due 2023 (16) when is mother’s day 2023 (19) when is prime day (34) when does daylight savings end (46) when does spotify wrapped come out (65) when is passover 2023 (88) when is amazon prime day (98) Seasonal and annual events should be a consideration for your content strategy, especially if it directly relates to your business or your target audience. Or perhaps, it competes with your marketing strategy – eyes on you Amazon Prime day, stealing all the July ecommerce traffic. The best thing about seasonal and annual events is – even if it’s not on the exact same day every year (as the top question queries show) – they happen around the same time every year, so you can prepare for each of them. Have a calendar of marketing events, seasonal events, and other relevant events for the year ahead so you can prep your marketing campaigns accordingly. 2) Big news and big trends As the world goes round, things happen – some mighty predictable, some mighty unpredictable. Day by day, our phones get pinged with breaking news stories and new trends emerge from TikTok or the likes. These are things you also want to keep on top of, along with the more seasonal events. Throughout 2023, a lot of things happened around the world – here are the top 3 question queries that were sparked by world news in 2023, from the US specifically: how did matthew perry die (18) what happened to damar hamlin (68) what is hamas (74) Now, these three question queries might not slot into your content strategy very easily, but it’s important to be aware of what’s happening in the world and what your target audience are talking about when it happens. While the search term “matthew perry” saw steady traffic from January to September in 2023, his death in October saw a huge rise in traffic, with many users heading to News sites. There are a number of benefits to including fresh keyword data and trending search terms in your marketing strategy, including: Fresh data means a fresh, up-to-date strategy Gain visibility on search and social media Beat your competition to it Keep your brand relevant Improved forecasting and reporting To make your lives easier, we update our “Top trending search terms on Google” article every month, so you know what topics are being searched for, and and how. 3) On our screens in 2023… The question ‘what to watch’ was the #1 most-asked question on Google for the US, sending most searchers through to YouTube. In fact, YouTube is the US website traffic leader for 3 of the top 10 question queries. The US’s love for watching ‘stuff’ is cemented by a few more of their top question queries for 2023, including: how much is netflix a month (57) where to watch harry potter (59) where to watch the super bowl (62) what to watch on netflix (63) where to watch everything everywhere all at once (71) where to watch heavenly delusion (77) where to watch yellowjackets (93) how to watch the super bowl (97) where to watch the office (100) … And those search terms are just in the top 100. The full list is littered with must-watches and what-to-watches.

think you got the deal of a century in last year’s Black Friday sale, but the next Black Friday sale tops it. It seems to happen every single year, so it comes as no surprise that the excitement for the occasion shows up very clearly in the top 100 most-asked questions for 2023 – particularly in the UK. To tell you the truth, “when is black friday” is #1 by a longshot, seeing over double the average monthly search volume that #2 has. That being “how much water should you drink a day”. It also comes ahead of annual events for the UK, like the clocks going forward and backwards. Although this theme does take up 4 search terms in the top 20. The desperation for one of the – or potentially the – biggest sales of the year is shown in 3 of the top 100 question queries in 2023: when is black friday (1) when is black friday 2023 (11) when is black friday 2023 uk (43) Online catalog Argos.com being the traffic leader for 2 of them, showing some favoritism amongst the British internet-surfing public. But what’s to say that traffic can’t be yours? And considering we’re just looking at question queries in 2023, you can imagine how many search terms (long-tail and short-tail) you could go after. The ups and downs of traffic (and interest) around the search term “black friday”, which – unsurprisingly – peaks in November each year. Make sure your website is fully optimized for the occasion, with these 9 Black Friday marketing strategies and trends. 2) Money on the mind A very common theme that’s threaded throughout the UK’s most-asked questions in 2023 is money or money-related queries. You could say the impatience for Black Friday’s return is one of them, but also: when is my mot due (23) how much tax will I pay (24) how to make money online (25) how much is my house worth (27) how much can I borrow mortgage (29) when is the next cost of living payment (36) how much is my car worth (37) what is minimum wage (54) how much can I borrow (63) how much is spotify premium (92) While some of these question terms solidify the previously mentioned importance of pricing pages, the repetitive theme also gives us a really good idea into the UK market as a whole. Knowing your target audience is one thing, but you also want to know more about each of the markets you’re selling into if you want to get, not only your marketing strategy, but your pricing strategy right too. As a business, it’s only natural you want to grow and become more profitable, and that often means expanding into new markets across the world. But, to go global, you’ve got to think local. By that we mean, you should have a deep understanding of the markets you’re targeting and apply that understanding to your business. You should adapt your company’s content to suit each market – specifically in terms of your language, currency, and pricing. It’s called true localization. Don’t you forget it. This is something to consider across all your brand’s content, whether that be landing pages, ads, social media or downloadable assets. Doing keyword research can give you intel that you won’t spot elsewhere, helping you get more granular with your research. For example, these money-related question queries could inspire your next discount campaign for your UK market, or perhaps a cash/car/house-prize competition could be in order. (Yes, please). 3) The seafood diet: We’re seeing food and eating it If you’ve glanced through the most-asked questions for the UK in 2023, chances are you’re hungry now. Why? Because there are so many food-related question queries in the mix: how long to boil an egg (14) how to make pancakes (17) how to make scrambled eggs (18) how to cook rice (31) how to make an omelette (42) how to make egg fried rice (61) how to boil an egg (69) how to make mashed potatoes (73) how to make yorkshire puddings (75) how to make pizza dough (86) how long to cook chicken breast in oven (87) how to make scones (95) Whether we’re looking at first-time cooks, first dates where we don’t want things going wrong (please see “how long does food poisoning last” at #39), or neither of those excuses, there’s no denying the need for ‘how to’ recipes or videos.
