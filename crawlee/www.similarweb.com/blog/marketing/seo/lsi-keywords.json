Good idea, right? Well, things have changed. Drastically. Keywords are still a big part of the SEO puzzle but there’s much, much more to making your mark and soaring to new SERP. This is because Google (and other search engines, like Bing and Baidu) are constantly improving their algorithms. Using related terms to your keywords, you can signal that you’re an expert. Keep reading to learn about how to use latent semantic indexing (LSI) to your advantage. What are LSI keywords? LSI keywords are keywords that are connected to your main keywords on a conceptual level, but they’re not synonyms (although it’s great to mix up your language throughout your content!). LSI is a technique related to language processing that has been around since the 1980s. The idea behind it is that when we search for certain words, we might actually be looking for something quite different. It works like this: Google wants to know what your content is about. So, it looks for your main keywords as well as all of the accompanying related keywords (these are LSI keywords). This way Google can understand what your page is all about. In SEO, LSI keywords are important because they allow your content to rank higher by establishing authority. When you use LSI keywords, search engines can understand your content better. It allows you to signal to Google that your content is valuable and related. In return, you’ll be rewarded by creeping up the SERPs. Since that’s the ultimate goal of SEO, you’ll want to pay attention to the LSI keywords that you’re adding to your texts. Here’s an example: You’ve written a great piece of content about laptops. When Google scans your piece to determine its topic and value, it will scan your LSI keywords. These may include ‘memory’, ‘RAM’, ‘mouse’, ‘monitor,’ ‘keyboard,’ ‘bag’, ‘screen size’, ‘13-inch,’ ‘laptop case,’ ‘gaming,’ – you get the idea. When Google picks up on these words it understands a few things: What this article is really about That you’ve provided a good amount of relevant information So, LSI helps search engines understand what you’re really searching for. For example, if someone types in the search query “when do the clocks change?”, they may actually be referring to “daylight savings time”. LSI keywords (which are related-by, but not synonyms, remember?) would help bring the searcher to the right piece of content that would give them the answer to the relevant question. There’s a debate about whether Google actually uses true LSI methods in its search algorithm. The truth is, it doesn’t really matter. What’s important is that using LSI keywords is an integral part of making a top-notch SEO strategy that brings in results. What are the advantages of LSI keywords? Using LSI keywords in your content is an easy and practical way to boost your website and content on SERPs and prove to Google that you’re a subject matter expert. While we’ve taken a look at the search query “what are LSI keywords”, remember that using LSI keywords well simply means integrating additional keywords that are connected to your main subject matter into your text. This shouldn’t be difficult if you’re writing helpful, in-depth content that serves your audience well. How to find LSI keywords? There are a lot of easy ways to search for LSI keywords. First of all, take a moment to think. Think about your content and the relevant phrases that come to mind when considering your main keyword. Why? To make your content as complete and well-rounded as possible, and cover all bases with the topic matter. Google itself is another great way to get info about potential LSI keywords. By taking a look at the autocomplete results, you’ll get a good idea about similar words and phrases that are related to your top keywords. And you can check out the “related searches” area at the bottom of the SERPs for ideas. You can even look at the Google knowledge graph for relevant searches which will also provide potential LSI keywords.
