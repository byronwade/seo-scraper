July 19, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Wanna know how to get your articles in SERP features? Silly question – of course you do. Your content ranking high or standing out in a SERP feature is amazing for brand visibility, authority and trust, click-through rates, organic traffic, competitive advantage and – hopefully – conversions. Step one = keyword research and SEO competitor analysis. Look at a core topic you want to rank well in, have a sneak peek at what is working for your competitors, and find out where the SERP features are showing up – all things that Similarweb can do for you. Annoyingly, doing your keyword research and competitive market analysis right doesn’t mean Google will just grant you this honor for your target search terms. However, knowing how to optimize your content for SERP features is a step (or six) in the right direction. ➡️ So with that, here are 5 SERP feature optimizations for your second step to win the visibility, website traffic, and – ideally – conversions you want: 1) Related question optimization Potentially the easiest way to get into the SERP features – related questions or People Also Ask. Here’s how to win it: Research related keywords: Use your keyword tool to find other relevant keywords to the topic you want to rank for, and trigger related questions. Create unique content: Search engines reward creativity, originality, and just generally quality content. Consider obvious or natural answers: Enhance your content with Instant Answers in mind to achieve featured snippets – for example, a “What is lead generation?” kinda question suits a “Lead generation is…” kinda answer. Work with topic clusters: Create content hubs to ensure you’re making the most of supporting content opportunities too. 2) Instant Answer optimization Speaking of… this is how to rank for the Instant Answer SERP feature (which is great for brand awareness and authority): Consider semantic keywords: Use Similarweb Keyword Generator to find semantic keywords with high search volume to boost the visibility of your content and HTML for specific topics. Be quick to answer: Answering the question in your first paragraph will make your answer more likely to rank. Create unique content: Looks like a common theme is forming already… Focus on your own niche: Create content around topics you can specialize in to win traffic. 3) Video optimization If your video content isn’t ranking well on YouTube, you can still optimize it to win SERP features. Here’s how: Keep it clear: Ensure your video title and description truly reflect what the video is about, and include the keywords you want to promote. Choose your picture wisely: Pick or make a thumbnail image that entices people, shows quality, makes them curious, or all of the above. Create a video transcript: Transcripts make your video content more searchable, as well as accessible across the web. Add videos across your website: Expand your audience reach by adding video content where it makes sense, eg. landing pages or blog content. 4) Local 3-pack optimization Or maybe you want to hit that handy local three-pack to prove yourself as the go-to dig for food, drinks, retail, beauty, or whatever it is you do. Register and complete your business profiles: Google My Business and Bing Places are two must-haves for businesses looking to rank in the local 3-pack, but also consider verifying your business on other local directories. Work out your priorities: Have more than one store? Use your analytics to identify the over and under-performing stores to work out how to prioritize them. Encourage customer reviews: Word of mouth is up there with the best promotional tactics, so make it easy for your customers to give (positive) online reviews. Localize your content: Use semantics, local language, and directions to reach your stores for the best results, as well as relevant keywords and phrases in your website content and title tags for maximum impact. 5) PPC optimization For those of you working with paid advertising, here are some ways you can optimize your pay-per-clicks in the search: Choose your target keywords: Make sure your ads only appear for searches that are relevant to your product and business. Use ad extensions: Ad extensions, like a call button, for example, provides additional information and opportunities for easy engagement. Perform A/B testing: See what works for your audience by split-testing your emails, eg. trailing different content for different audiences or locations Keep your CTAs clear: Ensure your ads all have a clear call to action to, well… drive action.
