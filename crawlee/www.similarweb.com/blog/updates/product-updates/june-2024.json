July 10, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic June signaled the start of summer (though the weather didn’t always play ball) and featured the longest day of the year. Here at Similarweb, we made the most of the long days and spent the month beavering away, releasing more updates, features, and improvements to our platform to deliver the best digital data and experience for our customers. So while the sun didn’t always shine, our latest updates are hot, hot, hot. Let’s take a look at what’s new: Scheduled reports: Easily automate your workflows First up, we’ve added report scheduling to the Data Exporter! This much-anticipated release means you can say goodbye to repetitive report setup and manual downloads. And you can say hello to automatically receiving the freshest, most up-to-date, customized data directly to your inbox as soon as it’s available with our new scheduling feature. Once you’ve set your eyes on the report you want to schedule, simply choose it from the list, select your cadence: daily, weekly, or monthly, and that’s it! The report will be automatically sent to your inbox. You just saved yourself hours of manual report configurations and downloads. Simple as that! It’s one of the most useful feature releases so far this year, especially for those of you who pull a lot of data from the Similarweb platform (including the old-fashioned Excel downloads). With the freshest data at hand, you can truly maximize the insights from our data and turn it into a real competitive advantage. Try it now ⇢ Search 3.0: More data added! Over in our Search tools, we’ve upgraded our keyword lists with Search 3.0 data and added an extra month of data, so you can now compare year-on-year insights for SEO and PPC. And no more having to toggle between desktop and mobile (though you still can); the device filter now includes mobile, desktop, and all traffic for holistic keyword insights. Try it now ⇢ And lastly we’ve added an extra layer of granularity when analyzing competitors and keywords. You can now gain insights into specific web properties – such as pages, folders, or subdomains – giving you more in-depth, content-level insights on the particular keywords and pages that drive traffic. Find precise keyword opportunities by comparing areas of your competitors’ website vs. yours. This will help you discover and analyze the exact keywords that are most relevant to your target focus, such as new opportunities for a product, blog, service, or anything you want to focus on. By adding a specific folder, such as skyscanner.com/hotels, you’ll find more targeted results and easily narrow down opportunities based on what competitors are optimizing for and where exactly you overlap. Try it now ⇢ More summer sizzlers on the way We’re halfway through 2024 now (how did that happen?!), and we’ve had numerous releases across our marketing, research, sales, investor, and shopper platforms. But we’re not slowing down – in July, we have some colossal new features and seismic data improvements to share – you may need to grab your shades for these updates. Till next time!
