October 14, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic In September, we fell into Fall, went back to school, and analyzed data to see what really happened in the digital world: Is the web builder market losing steam? Traffic to WordPress.com and WPEngine.com is down 16.3% and 8.6% YoY New Balance is making a name for itself across Europe in an extremely competitive market, as its search volume skyrocketed, up 68.9% in the UK, 32.3% in France, and 13.1% in Germany Temu has become the #2 web marketplace in App Ecommerce, narrowing Amazon’s lead by over 30M Monthly Active Users (MAUs) this year Let’s not forget about the platform updates—the focus was on bolstering our Search Intelligence suite. Maybe we should call it Searchtember? Or maybe we should stick to what we’re best at… Here’s what was new in September: Paid Landing Pages You can now see the pages your competitors are driving paid traffic to with our bolstered Paid Landing Pages report. Added drill-downs show individual ads and their ad spend so that you can make smarter budgeting decisions. Choose a specific month or get data from the last 28 days for a fresh view. Click Data upgrade We’ve refreshed and upgraded the data in Rank Tracker to improve the accuracy of click data with our dynamic click-through rate calculation. We’ve also added a new filter to the share of voice metric so you can easily track your share over your named competitors and against the whole SERP on any given day. Keyword Trends report In our Rank Tracker, we launched a new report: Keyword Trends. This beautifully visualized report lets you easily see gains and drops over time with either daily, weekly, or monthly granularity. You can also toggle between organic and universal positions for a true reflection of your search performance. More data and insights to come next month While you go in search of clever Halloween costumes and the best candy, we are building out new and enhancing existing features to make sure you are getting the best digital data the way you need it.
