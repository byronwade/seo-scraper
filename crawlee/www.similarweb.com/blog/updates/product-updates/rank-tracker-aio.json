August 19, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Similarweb’s Rank Tracker now allows marketers and SEO professionals to see which keywords trigger Google’s AI Overview feature. This is an incredibly powerful new feature that will equip marketers with the information they need to adapt to the changing search landscape. What are AI Overviews, though? AI Overviews provide an AI-generated summary of a query. They appear above both the traditional “blue links” to articles and the Featured Snippets on the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). Even though they are still new and do not appear for all queries, AI Overviews could fundamentally change how search works. After all, they offer an experience similar to ChatGPT and Gemini, but within Google’s main platform. This means users will be able to find basic information without clicking on paid or organic listings. So, website managers and SEO professionals will need to carefully track their rankings and traffic to their top pages. Plus, our research shows that AI chatbots rank brands very differently than traditional search engines do. Marketing teams will need new strategies to optimize their presence in AI-generated results. Understanding search behavior in an AI world That’s why we built this functionality into our Rank Tracker. Now, you can view and filter keywords based on the presence of AI Overviews. This feature helps you stay ahead of search trends and adjust your SEO strategies effectively. Plus, you’ll be able to check the impact of SERP items with AI Overviews and filter results to focus on them. “Knowing when AI Overviews are influencing search traffic and user behavior is an important first step in understanding how the SEO landscape is changing,” said Baruch Toledano, VP of Acquisition Solution at Similarweb. “In the next phase, we will take a closer look at how often AI Overviews contain links to other resources—and how content and SEO tactics can influence such results. We want to show when AI Overviews drive traffic and when they reinforce zero-click behavior – where people decide they’ve gotten a complete enough answer to their question without ever leaving the SERP.” Get AI Overview insights in seconds Rank Tracker’s AI Overview detection is now available to all customers whose subscriptions include comprehensive SEO capabilities, including Starter, Business, and Enterprise packages.
