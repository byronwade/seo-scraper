June 11, 2021 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic One of the biggest challenges for researchers and data analysts is to measure audience loyalty within their industry to identify the players who are gaining the lion’s share of website traffic. Luckily we have released a new Digital Research Intelligence feature called Audience Loyalty for Industry Analysis that does just that. Our newest feature helps you determine audience loyalty within your industry by evaluating visitor engagement across one or more websites. The variable scale of audience loyalty We measure audience loyalty by showing the proportion of Monthly Active Users (also known as MAUs) who visited one site versus other sites within the same industry in the same time period. This scale is presented on a spectrum from “Exclusively This Site” to “Visited 6 Sites or More.” You can also filter using the timeframe and region dropdown. Why measure audience loyalty for your market research Here are 3 reasons why this feature is valuable, and why it is suitable for adding to your current audience research: 1. Keep a pulse on audience loyalty Analyze average audience loyalty to benchmark your company against your competitors or the industry average. 2. Identify industry leaders with the most loyal audience Discover which players have loyal customers and identify potential threats to your own audience. 3. See the distribution of audience loyalty across individual sites Identify where you can win back audience share from your competitors, and how. Here are some examples of the feature in action and the insights you can gain from the new feature. Example 1: News and media Here you can see the top 10 sites for news and media industry in the U.S. in the last 12 months. Taking a quick look and you can see that readers are not very loyal when it comes to consuming media with an average loyalty score of 84%. Example 2: Social media and online networks Facebook has the biggest traffic share in U.K., with 23% of its audience visiting only this social media site, showing that the social giant still holds the top position for online networking. Example 3: Banking and financial services The banking and credit lending services industry is evenly distributed across top 10 key players in the German finserv market, which shows that audiences are highly loyal to their bank of choice.
