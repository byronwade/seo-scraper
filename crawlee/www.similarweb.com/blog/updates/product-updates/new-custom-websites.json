It’s our Custom Websites feature, which lets you analyze a group of websites together using accumulated data.

With Custom Websites you can analyze multiple websites in a single search. You’ll be able to explore metrics such as Visits, All Traffic Sources, Mobile Web, Geographic distribution, and Traffic Destination.* Analyzing eBay.com, eBay.co.uk and eBay.co.jp as a group The main advantage Custom Websites brings is a more strategic analysis with an instant view of the bigger picture. For example, eBay has multiple TLDs for each country it operates in. Let’s say you want to understand eBay’s global marketing strategy and market share, with Custom Websites you can place the local TLDs you want to research in one group, and then continue to analyze them as you would a single website. You can see which websites exist in the group by hovering on the group’s name How do I create a Custom Websites Group? To start working with Custom Website Groups you’ll need to contact your account manager and send over: The name you want to call the group A list of sites you’d like to include in the group Your account manager will then add this group to your account and update you once it’s live. Each group of custom websites can be accessed through the ‘Website Analysis’ home page, under the ‘Favorites’ tab. This specific feature is a result of several requests we received from our clients and we were happy to be able to bring it to life. Don’t hesitate to send over your own suggestions and requests.
