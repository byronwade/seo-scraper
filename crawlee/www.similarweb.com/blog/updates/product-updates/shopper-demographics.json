But what makes Amazon or Target shoppers unique? What differentiates your brand’s customers from the ones that buy your competitor’s products? Knowing your shoppers is the first step in optimizing your marketplace marketing strategy. But, as you know, marketplaces are walled gardens.

You can break them down by age, gender, education level, household size and income level, and employment status. By knowing exactly who’s shopping, you can: Optimize your product portfolio to fit your audience Adjust your pricing strategy to match shoppers’ income level and employment status Fine-tune your marketing messages to emphasize needle-moving product features We’re starting with demographic data for amazon.com, and will expand to more retailers later this year.
