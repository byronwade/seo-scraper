March 9, 2015 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic We’re at hard work as usual, and it’s really starting to pay off. At Similarweb we’re no stranger to making headlines, and so far in 2015, we’ve had our fair share of press. The company has more than doubled in size in the past year, and along with that came new projects and exciting ventures. 2014 saw the advent of our Mobile App Analysis platform, and last week our App Engagement feature officially left the beta phase to enter the SMB market. In the past two months, there’s been quite a bit of buzz about App Engagement, because it gives insight into app stickiness based on usage patterns and user behavior, not just install volume and store rank. We’ve published quite a few articles using this new feature, including the top 50 most used Android apps in the US – and more recently, the most addictive social apps in America. The New York Times, Mashable, BusinessWeek, and TechCrunch (among others) have used our actionable data to draw insights into the digital world, and these findings are featured in their stories. Sometimes we’re asked to provide our thoughts on how certain new products are performing – like this article for International Business Times on Youtube’s new “What’s Next” feature. Other times we’re asked to comment directly on interesting trends we’ve noticed by using our platform. With the ability to measure usage patterns for mobile apps, we’ve discovered the existence of “zombie apps,” and we’ve written about our predictions on what this means for the app ecosystem. We’ve been asked about our thoughts on where the digital world is headed by leading industry publications like Search Engine Watch, and we always deliver – using insights from our continually evolving platform. Others in the marketing industry have written about Similarweb, including using the platform to analyze other market intelligence platforms. Most recently, hostingadvice.com gave Similarweb a whirl, and they thoroughly enjoyed the ride. We also have a new channel on The Next Web featuring our data-driven stories. And speaking of stories, our CEO and founder, Or Offer was recently interviewed by Jobspotting about Similarweb and how this “little startup that could” is now a global presence, recognized by industry professionals as a leader in digital measurement. So to pat ourselves on the back a bit more: Here’s to us. And here’s to you, our clients and users, who have helped us make this digital dream a reality. by Lauren Meir Lauren is a writer with a background in content marketing and creative branding.
