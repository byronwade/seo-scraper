We’ve also added new dashboards for our two top sections – Website Analysis and App Analysis. In this dashboard you’ll see your – recently visited and your favorite websites/apps. We’ve also added to these dashboards a dynamic feed with the hottest trending websites and trending apps, making it easier for you to stay updated with recent industry changes.
