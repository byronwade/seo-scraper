August 12, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic July wasnâ€™t a quiet month, using Similarweb data we saw: How Nike were the commercial winners from the Olympics (and what people were searching for after that Opening Ceremony) How Reddit gets a whopping 58% of its traffic from Google Search, off the back of the publisher famously blocking Bing How interest in SearchGPT soared, and what this may mean for big retailers But aside from providing insights about the biggest online trends of the moment, here at Similarweb we had a bumper month for releasing new product features and data updates. Letâ€™s see what was new in Julyâ€¦ Unveiling the latest data version and platform enhancements Data upgrade: bigger and better Weâ€™re excited to share that our newest data version was officially released on July 28, 2024. This update brought significant enhancements to our data, including improved accuracy in web data estimations, expanded domain coverage (30 million more websites!), and algorithm updates that incorporate the latest advancements in our web methodologies. New sidebar: quicker speed to insights Alongside the new data version, we also introduced a refreshed look to the platform. A redesigned, user-friendly sidebar now makes navigation smoother, allowing you to access insights more quickly. Say hello to Search Intelligence This update includes a brand new, dedicated Search Intelligence section, streamlining the process of gathering valuable insights. Introducing our Site Audit tool for SEO professionals For our SEO experts, we launched a powerful new tool â€“ A Site Audit tool. This tool is designed to crawl even the most complex websites, detecting errors and identifying opportunities for performance improvements. Site Audit offers a comprehensive view of your websiteâ€™s performance, highlighting key areas in the traffic funnel where optimizations can lead to significant increases in organic traffic. With over 300 performance factors analyzed, a robust data explorer for in-depth analysis, and shareable reports, this tool is a valuable asset for any SEO team. Maximize Keyword Analysis with the new Overview page We also unveiled our brand-new Overview page, crafted to elevate your keyword analysis capabilities. This page provides a detailed analysis of any keyword or keyword listâ€™s potential, offering insights into your Total Addressable Market (TAM) and the composition of SERPs. With this new feature, you can make informed decisions about where to focus your efforts, whether on paid or organic strategies, ensuring your approach is data-driven and effective. Enhanced Keyword Research with Integrated Total Traffic View Weâ€™ve enhanced our keyword research capabilities by integrating the Total Traffic view into our dedicated keyword research pages like Website Keywords and SERP Players. This integration allows users to access holistic insights by combining both organic and paid traffic data, giving you a comprehensive view of your total traffic potential. Custom Heatmaps for Investors on Stock Intelligence For our investors, we introduced Custom Heatmaps within our Stock Intelligence platform. These heatmaps can be tailored to highlight trends in your key sectors, enabling deep analysis of market trends for any public or private website. With access to three years of historical data, these heatmaps provide a powerful tool for making informed investment decisions.
