February 14, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic While you guys were all busy signing up to the gym in January (or sighing at the influx of new gym-goers taking up the machines), we were pretty active ‚Äì just not with a treadmill or weights. In January 2024, we released a bunch of updates across our features. üí™ Because there‚Äôs no Strava for Similarweb product updates, how about we go into detail now? Rank Tracker updates First up, we‚Äôre in Rank Tracker where we introduced three fresh updates: 1) A brand new keyword position view Making your computer screens a little more scenic and making the endless task of rank tracking both quicker and more efficient, we‚Äôve added a color-coded report to show where your keywords rank, where they‚Äôre rising and dropping over time ‚Äì whether that be by day, week or month. ‚Üí Try it now 2) Your overall performance by rank We‚Äôve also added a new overview report so you can see your overall performance, grouped by position. Is your percentage of keywords in positions 1-3 climbing? You‚Äôre about to find out. ‚Üí Try it now 3) Google algorithm notations Sometimes, changes in the SERP have nothing to do with you or your content ‚Äì sometimes, it‚Äôs just Google doing its thing (whether we like it or not). That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve added notations of all Google algorithm updates ‚Äì including all historic updates ‚Äì to highlight how they may have impacted your rankings. ‚Üí Try it now Brand Protection updates 1) New advertisers report Here‚Äôs another way to make sure you never miss a beat with your paid marketing efforts with our Brand Protection tool: our brand new Advertisers report. See all your paid competitors, their share of voice, ad content and performance in one, single view. Easy! ‚Üí Try it now 2) Alerts when you want alerts We‚Äôve also upgraded our alerts. You can now choose between daily or weekly emails to alert you when a rival bids on your keywords, so you‚Äôre always in-the-know. ‚Üí Try it now Shopper Intelligence updates And finally, brand new to Shopper Intelligence, we‚Äôve got keyword lists. Say goodbye to having to spend lots of time analyzing keywords individually ‚Äì now you can group keywords together to analyze topics. That way you can stay on top of consumer trends, and gain more impactful insights for your Amazon strategy. ‚Üí Try it now Give kudos for January Don‚Äôt go thinking that us being so active is just a ‚Äúnew year, new us‚Äù January claim. We‚Äôre in it for the long haul, and we‚Äôve got lots planned for 2024 ‚Äì we‚Äôll be sure to keep you updated along the way.
