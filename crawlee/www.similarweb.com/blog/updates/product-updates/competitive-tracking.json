You need relevant insights to stay competitive in a fast-changing digital world. Until now there wasn’t a centralized way to track your competitive landscape and continuously report to your key stakeholders. That’s why we’re excited to share with you the early release of Competitive Tracking to surface the metrics that are important for your business, make smarter business decisions, and ultimately grow your market share. Plus, we’ve rolled out improved enhancements to our premium feature, Segment Analysis, for deeper page-level insights. 1. Win your market with Competitive Tracking Competitive Tracking is the most innovative way to measure and track your digital traffic share and the performance of your competitive landscape. This new feature will help you to: Track your competitor landscape with an aggregated view directly against your competitors, allowing you to monitor digital traffic share over time Enable an apples-to-apples comparison by benchmarking websites and segments based on comprehensive analysis Quickly surface insights based on changing competitive dynamics and know when to adapt your strategy or react to potential threats For example, if you’re a retailer and you want to monitor your digital market share against other core business lines within your competitive set or if you’re a publisher, and need to track your share of voice against other media companies that cover similar topics such as tech, politics, or health news. You can find the Competitive Tracking feature in the brand new section “My Trackers” in the top navigation bar. It is an evolution of our Workspace and has been released in closed beta so we can gather valuable feedback from our users. We have a lot more product updates to add in the future and this is just the beginning of the digital monitoring journey. 2. New enhancements to the Segment Analysis feature Analyze laser-focused page-level insights faster than ever We’ve rolled out a unique way to analyze websites, landing pages, and product pages in just a few clicks. The new feature is called Exact URL and it’s available in Segment Analysis. It will enable you to build a website segment based on the specific URL of any page. Compare daily trends for better forecasting and get ahead of the game We’ve also added daily granularity within the Segment Comparison mode so you can analyze seasonal trends such as Black Friday, Superbowl, and Election Day to identify peaks in traffic across specific dates and discover who is gaining traction or underperforming during tentpole moments.
