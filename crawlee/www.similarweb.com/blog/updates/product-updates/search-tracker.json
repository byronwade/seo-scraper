September 28, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Today, we’re excited to announce that we’ve launched a new module on Similarweb: Search Tracker. This is made up of two features: Rank Tracker and Brand Protection, and they’re here to deliver a holistic approach to search tracking and monitoring. Rank Tracker allows SEO and marketing teams to keep on top of organic search, giving daily updates into your own – and your competitors’ – rankings on search. Brand Protection is for the PPC marketers out there, sending alerts when any competitive moves are made on your chosen, business-critical paid keywords, whether they’re branded or not. Game-changing tracking for search marketers Completing our search toolkit, these new monitoring and tracking tools equip marketers with everything they need to create, maintain and adapt a winning digital strategy. Because the search landscape is more complicated, competitive and changeable than ever before. And marketers need to react fast to get and stay ahead. “Speed is important in search marketing, making daily data updates essential for any digital marketing team,” said Or Offer, CEO of Similarweb. “Our customers tell us that they can counter competitive threats more effectively and take advantage of opportunities before they slip away when they respond quickly, and providing more current data is one of the ways we’re responding to that requirement. In addition, SEO and PPC teams and the tools they use are too often siloed, leading to disjointed strategies. Search Tracker helps bring those teams together around a single source of truth.” Rank Tracker: Track organic searches every day, for any location Rank Tracker does what it says on the tin: it monitors search rankings on a daily basis, providing you with an up-to-date view of SERPs. With this tool, you can: Get an accurate daily view of what’s happening on search See how your content weighs up against your competitors Find out which domains are competing against yours (and you might be surprised) Understand which of your own pages might be cannibalizing your pillar content Track rankings from anywhere in the world – from country to city, and city to ZIP code Compare Weighted Average Position, Visibility and Clicks – three advanced metrics that show your keyword performance on a daily basis, with unrivaled accuracy. Okay, okay – we know, you’ve seen some rank trackers in your time, but you haven’t experienced granularity and reliability like this. Our advanced metrics, real-user data, and unique reports are industry-leading: Competitor Report: See every single competitor for a keyword, along with how many clicks each receive SERP feature report: A full breakdown of page 1 of the SERP for any given keyword – we monitor Google for you, as well as your keywords With this information, you’ll know exactly what to do and how to optimize your content to get to – and stay on – page 1. Our Competitor Report tool, showcasing all the competitors that are going after the same keywords you’re tracking and how their positions change over time. Brand Protection: Get alerted to competitors’ bids against you Did we mention it’s a competitive world out there? Oh yes, we did. And in the competitive world of search, businesses fight dirty – some, dirtier than others. Consider our new Brand Protection tool a shield for any keyword battles you may face. With our Brand Protection tool, you can monitor your competitors’ paid keywords and be alerted when a competitor makes any moves on your business-critical and branded keywords. An example of the Brand Protection alert that would come directly to your inbox. With our superior data on hand, you can spot threats and opportunities early to quickly pivot your strategy and ultimately, win or win back the traffic that you deserve. Be reactive – don’t miss your chance by skipping those daily updates to, and on, the SERPs. Why you want to align your SEO and PPC efforts In SEO and PPC, you have a single goal: Enhancing your brand’s online presence. So, while the functions are separate, the channel you’re operating on is exactly the same. With a holistic view of the SERPs, and tracking it as a marketing team, you gain a far deeper understanding of how search works, its changes, and how to adapt to those changes. Use this holistic view – or single source of truth – to align your two strategies, strengthening your journey towards that one goal of digital acquisition. Aligning your data, your content, your target audience, and your keywords make for a better, more consistent customer experience, increasing your credibility and trust as a brand. And you know what that means? More engagement, whether they’re new users, returning users, or referred users.
