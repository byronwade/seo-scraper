November 27, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic The Similarweb Shopper Intelligence team is thrilled to announce the launch of our latest, free dashboard, My Brand Analytics. The first, and only, dashboard of its kind, My Brand Analytics is set to change the game for ecommerce businesses. But, before we explain how we’re doing that, let us explain why. We believe data is to business what gas is to a car. It’s not the only factor that will make or break your trip, but it’s pretty important to get you from point A to point B… For real, though, all joking aside, if you want to take your ecommerce business from 0-60, the data you use to fuel your strategy matters. Amazon data at your fingertips In 2021 about 50% of all ecommerce purchases in the U.S. happened through Amazon, generating a whopping revenue of about $470 billion. That’s no small number. And because Amazon is so big, it makes it the most competitive ecommerce platform out there. And how do you win in a competitive space? With data. Data provided within the Amazon platform lacks clarity and insight: it’s hard to use and time-consuming to analyze. So, we rolled up our sleeves and got to work creating My Brand Analytics, a free dashboard to add to our Similarweb Shopper Intelligence offering. Our goal was simple. We wanted to give you a consolidated, insightful view of your data that is easy to digest to help you better leverage that traffic and get in on more profit. Here’s how we’re doing that. What does My Brand Analytics do? My Brand Analytics is a free, easy-to-use dashboard that visualizes Seller Central data so ecommerce teams can increase sales on Amazon. The result? Boosted brand management and growth. We value quality, trustworthy data, and an intuitive UX. So, we created an easy-to-use dashboard that organizes your Amazon Seller data. You’ll get three main benefits: Data Aggregation – Compile your Amazon Vendor / Seller Central data into one organized dashboard complete with visualizations Sales Performance – Monitor the performance of your brands and products Comparative analysis – Compare your brand and products against one another to identify which are high and low performing Fuel your Amazon business with boosted insights “Without reliable, accurate, actionable data businesses have no way to navigate the ecommerce landscape effectively. We are proud to take the guesswork out of data analysis and give our customers the information they need in a visual, intuitive format. Digital trends change so quickly so it’s critical for ecommerce brands to access clear data, and gain insights to improve their strategy instantly.” – Tali Chuchinsky This dashboard is easy to set up and always free to use. Just connect your Amazon Vendor / Seller Central account with a few clicks, and, boom, your life just got a whole lot easier. Get More Ecommerce Insights Stop guessing. Start analyzing.
