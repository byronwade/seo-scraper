Then you’re going to want to check out these new Shopper Intelligence features: Product Module Market Share Here’s everything you need to know. Product Module Analyze any ASIN on Amazon and create custom categories. How you define your products and categories may not always line up with Amazon’s category taxonomy. Analyzing consumer demand based on your own definitions of the market can help you generate more actionable insights, and unify your teams’ view of the market. To help you analyze demand in a way that’s suitable to your needs, we’ve launched a new product module. Now you can analyze individual ASINs, group products together, and build ASIN cohorts based on different criteria. You can also: Create custom categories based on a predefined list of ASINs or product attributes, to understand performance on a more granular level Monitor individual ASIN performance, and learn how product attributes like price, badges, and reviews impact sales Generate new product ideas based on the high-performing products in your category Market Share Monitor brands’ market share in different categories. Market share is a key KPI for any company, especially in eCommerce. Traditionally, brands turned to research firms (like Nielsen or IRI) and bought spreadsheets of data, but understanding market share within a specific marketplace was never an easy task. Now you can easily track any brand’s market share on Amazon with our new market share feature. With market share insights, you can: Track changes in your market position Prioritize investment in certain categories based on market share changes Identify competitors that gain market share quickly and create an action plan Ready to give it a try?
