The sun be shining, the lambs be bleating, the daffodils be blooming, March be marching, and Similarweb be releasing more (and more) product updates. What more could you want from a season? Check out what we’ve been up to over the past month: Demand Analysis: Brand new to your toolkit Explore what consumers are searching for, including those macro and micro-trends that fuel demand with our all-new Demand Analysis tool. This tool captures both search and click data, so you get a comprehensive view of the customer journey, making it easier than ever to predict the next big thing (so you can cancel your Amazon delivery of that crystal ball, then). → Try it now Search 3.0: More power to your SEO strategy Humble brag alert: We’ve just released the most powerful SEO dataset on the planet. Combining real-user data with SERP data, it’s about to take your keyword research and SEO competitor analysis to new heights. Not to mention the fact that it recalibrates every single day. → Try it now Company funding data: New intel for your lead generation Adding to the wealth of company information you can already find on Sales Intelligence, you’ve now got company funding data. Find your ideal target accounts by filtering your search for businesses based on the funding they’ve raised. → Try it now Technology renewal signals: Efficiently-timed sales pitches Also in the Sales Intelligence mix, we’ve introduced technology renewal signals, pointing you in the direction of prospects with technologies on their website that are likely to be up for renewal in the next 3 months. This alert to prospects’ expiring contracts gives you the opportunity to focus on high-potential leads, making sure you are in the right place (their inbox) at the right time (contract renewal) to close those deals faster. → Try it now Stock Intelligence: New and improved Our Stock Intelligence platform has seen two key updates for investors – both helping you to make more informed decisions. First up, our ticker page redesign simplifies the subsidiary analysis process, tracking subsidiary domains automatically to bring you their Traffic and Engagement data, including marketing channel data. This means analysts can now easily gauge a company’s health and growth trajectory through the data, assessing its impact on ticker performance. On top of that, you can now analyze online sign-ups with Subscription Growth – leveraging the proven correlation between increased sign-ups and stock performance – for more accurate forecasting of upcoming stock performance. → Try it now Spring into action this Spring Don’t go thinking we’re only being this nice because the seasonal affective disorder has started to slide. We’re in it for the long haul and we’ve got lots more planned for 2024 – we’ll be sure to keep you updated along the way. Stay tuned for April.
