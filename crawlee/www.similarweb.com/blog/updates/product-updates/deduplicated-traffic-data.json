February 10, 2020 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic We’re very happy to announce the latest release from Similarweb’s data team: deduplicated audience data! A new metric which will allow you to gauge a site’s true unique user base. How does the Deduplicated Traffic Metric Work Similarweb’s traffic metric measures total visits to a site. Our unique visits metric measures the number of unique devices entering a site. The new deduplicated web traffic data takes this to the next level, and measures a site’s reach, or the number of unique users visiting a site, across devices. Understanding a sites’ true desktop vs. mobile vs. both split is instrumental in getting a more accurate audience analysis. This allows companies to come up with more strategic media budgets across devices. This will answer questions like: How does my site’s reach compare to that of my competitors? How loyal is my audience compared to other sites in my industry? Is the new partner I’m qualifying really that popular? Want to see this in action? Below is a sample insight: Audience Analysis on Entertainment News Sites A review of the biggest Entertainment News sites, brings up 5 core competitors: people.com leads with 40% of the group’s traffic, followed by tmz.com with 24%. Checking web traffic patterns also reveal that the sites are losing traffic over time, specifically people.com. A look at reach alongside traffic reveals that people.com leads not only in traffic but also in total audience size. Tmz.com may see more traffic than eonline.com, but this is mostly due to a devout following, as eonline.com has more unique visitors across devices. In fact, reviewing the share of traffic versus audience reached by each of the sites, we discover that both of the top two players have a bigger share of total traffic than total reach. This means that they are more likely to see repeat visitors across devices, than the smaller players. Finally, we can combine reach with the unique devices metric, to understand how people relate to a site. Is this a site that they will be browsing across devices, throughout the day, or just in certain scenarios. In the case of the most popular news sites, we see a clear trend: less than 20% of audiences view these news sites on both desktop and mobile, meaning that the content is relevant in a unique scenario, and doesn’t follow the user throughout the day. In understanding traffic patterns to a site of any type, it is crucial to get the whole picture. While each metric gives one part of the picture, combining traffic, device split and total reach is the only way to get a complete understanding of a sites’ performance. This new metric will be available to select Marketing, Research, Sales and Investors solution clients in the coming weeks.
