Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re thrilled to unveil our newest tool, Demand Analysis, designed to enable insight, strategy and marketing teams to dive deep into consumer trends like never before. Demand analysis gives you a comprehensive view of the customer journey, from search to clicks, helping you capture actual intent signals. Search data is a scientifically proven way to uncover consumer trends â€“ It complements other insights from social listening and traditional surveys to paint a more robust picture of consumer needs. With Demand Analysis, you can understand macro and micro consumer trends to: Maximize revenue: Identify new growth opportunities and increase digital market share in a highly competitive market Drive efficiency: Align products with consumer needs to drive product development efficiency Try it now! Why Choose Demand Analysis? ðŸ“Š Actionable Data Consumer preferences change quickly in the digital world, often outpacing analysis from surveys. Social listening overlooks those who do not actively engage and opinions are often biased, and Google Trends doesnâ€™t capture post-search behavior. With Demand Analysis, you will capture the customer journey in near real-time, from initial searches to final clicks, providing macro and micro trend insights for audiences beyond social and Google search. ðŸ’¡ Speed to Insights Companies rely on manual keyword grouping and analysis for trend prediction, which is highly time-consuming. To grow digital share in a highly competitive market, companies need to know their consumer demand at a granular level â€“ and in a timely manner. Demand Analysis surfaces valuable insights and answers key business questions in minutes. ðŸ’° Monetization Potential Social listening tools excel at sentiment analysis, yet quantifying sentiment remains challenging. We understand quantifying the value of a trend and analyzing the size of demand is critical for you. Validate your findings and evaluate monetization potential to ensure youâ€™re investing your efforts in the right direction. Donâ€™t miss out on understanding consumer demand at a granular level. Check out Demand Analysis and stay ahead of the curve in todayâ€™s competitive market. How can you unlock consumer trends with Demand Analysis? Letâ€™s look at an example. Health-conscious chocolate search terms (e.g. plant-based chocolate) grew 35% year-over-year, suggesting consumers are increasingly interested in specialty, healthier ingredients. â€˜Gluten Freeâ€™ and â€˜Dairy Freeâ€™ are growing trends within the health chocolate category while â€˜Veganâ€™ is showing a slight decline. As we can see, the demand for healthy chocolate options is in line with seasonality trends, with people most keen on healthier alternatives during December. In the U.S., Walmart and Amazon are capturing most of the demand for dairy-free chocolate, followed by recipe websites Simply Whisked and Cookie Dough Diaries. That leaves a lot of room for specialty healthy chocolate brands to double down on paid and organic search to capture additional traffic. What can we learn from these trends? Healthy chocolates are on the rise with â€˜gluten freeâ€™ and â€˜dairy freeâ€™ leading the charge. These valuable demand trends can fuel product portfolios and investment decisions for major chocolate brands. Companies already operating in the â€˜health-consciousâ€™ sector can enhance their marketing efforts by prioritizing investment in these specific areas, seizing the growing demand for â€˜gluten-freeâ€™ and â€˜dairy-freeâ€™ chocolates.
