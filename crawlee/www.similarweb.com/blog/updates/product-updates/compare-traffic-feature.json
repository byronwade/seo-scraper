January 6, 2014 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic There’s nothing quite like keeping up with your New Years’ resolutions. Here at Similarweb, our resolutions mainly revolve around making our data beautiful, simple to understand and accessible to all of our users, whether it’s the media buyer that is trying to figure out which ad networks to use, the affiliate manager trying to get new affiliates, the industry researcher trying to discover exciting new insights, or the PPC campaign manager trying to find great keyword ideas. Our latest feature release provides all this and more. I believe our users would agree, it creates a whole new world of competitive intelligence. Most of our users are familiar with the Comparison feature that was available in the system up until now. It’s easily accessible through the ‘Compare’ button, located at the top right corner of the menu: Deeper Website Traffic Comparison Possibilities So what’s new actually? The old comparison was done by using from a drop down menu and viewing each of the competitors separately. Today the comparison is with an instant view, across all traffic channels. Let’s go over some of the amazing new analysis possibilities you gain with this new feature by running a comparison between 5 competitor sites: 1. In the following chart you can see a comparison between paid and organic traffic share for each of these website building platforms; Wix, Webs, Weebly, Jimdo, and Yola. This comparison gives you a clear picture regarding the different search strategies amongst these 5 competitors: 2. The following graph shows you the search trends for all 5 sites together. Comparing their search traffic progress, both organic and paid, has never been easier: 3. Another great insight you gain with the new comparison feature you’ll find in the ‘Display Advertising’ section, under the ‘Ad Network’ tab. You can see very clearly, in the table below, not only which ad networks your competitors are using, but also how they divide their advertising budget in each of these ad networks as well as where they stand, in comparison with you: 4. If you found the ad networks comparison interesting, you’re going to find this next option mind blowing. In what we here, at Similarweb, like to call – The Battle of Keywords, you get a full view of not only which keywords your competitors are using, but also what is their traffic share per keyword, in comparison with you: We’re offering a 1 on 1 training session with Similarweb PRO consultants. This is a great opportunity to learn how to best use the different features of the tool, including this new comparison feature. If you’re interested in setting up a private session, contact us with your details and one of Similarweb PRO’s consultants will get back to you. by Natalie Halimi Natalie Halimi has over 10 years of marketing experience across B2C and B2B sectors.
