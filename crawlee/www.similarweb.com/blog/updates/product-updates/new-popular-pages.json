Here are a few ways to use the add-on, and start leveraging its intel for your competitive gain. 1. Deeper website analysis When doing a competitive website analysis, a domain-level perspective is good, but page-level analytics can be golden.

This intel allows you to quickly hone in on high-impact pages and teardown the elements that make them appealing to your target audience. 2. Analyze on-site search Discover how an audience uses site search (based on URL parameters) to find and browse content or products. 3.

Uncover vital insights into their strategies, such as: Emerging promotions New products or services Pricing changes New messaging or marketing tactics 4. View and track rival’s top products, services, and content Popular Pages makes it easy to view the busiest pages on rival sites, determine what content, products, or topics are most engaging, and how interest shifts over time. Measure the appetitive for specific brands or products on partner, affiliate, or competitor sites. View the busiest pages and see how interest evolves. 5. Measure the success of campaigns For specific intel about ongoing campaign take-up, view metrics that show periodic changes in interest and performance. See how successfully your rival’s campaigns drive traffic to their site. 6. Determine the most valuable markets or countries Refine specific URLs to track, unpack, and evaluate a rival’s impact in a country.
