December 20, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic This time last year I wrote the ‘only constant is change’, and 2023 has taught me to stand by that. In fact in 2022, we started building the next version of Similarweb, and my proudest moment in 2023 was when we launched Similarweb 3.0, taking digital intelligence to the next level. While the market landscape changed, we worked hard and fast to bring you new features, improvements and tools to help your business gain the edge in a far more fiercely saturated competitive arena than ever before. We’ve focused on giving businesses more granular, in depth and real time data to know the market, and own the market. From our marketing and research capabilities, through to our ecommerce and sales solutions, we’ve added data points, data sources, country filters, new metrics and hundreds of other improvements too. So without further ado, here’s a rundown of our most impactful releases of 2023: Similarweb AI: SimilarAsk 2023 was dominated by AI, and here at Similarweb, we launched a very exciting AI tool of our own: SimilarAsk. What started as a hackathon project turned into an AI assistant within our platform designed to answer real user questions. Similarweb 3.0 New-look packages, data, tools and support, all in one place. Our customers now can add viewers to every account, access advanced sharing and security features, and experience our top-tier client services. See the market research and marketing features introduced along with Similarweb 3.0 below: Market Research 1) Market Analysis The Market Analysis feature is the new go-to for discovering smarter growth opportunities. Size and segment any market, track your digital market share, and benchmark business performance using digital signals correlated with success.

This year, we’ve enhanced your Segments experience by adding it to Custom Industries, releasing All Traffic data, creating segments from the Folders page, and even adding your most valuable segment to your Dashboards. Try in platform → Marketing 1) Competitive Tracker Our new-look Competitive Tracker sets you at the head of the pack by letting you track up to 25 competitor websites and highlight critical changes across your competitive set.
