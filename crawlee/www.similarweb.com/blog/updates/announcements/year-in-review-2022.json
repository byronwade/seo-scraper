January 17, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic 2022 was marred with the backdrop of a war in Ukraine, global market instability, and a cost of living crisis. The prediction of the 21st century version of the ‘Roaring ‘20s’ has – so far – fallen flat. Operating and succeeding in this landscape is not only difficult but radically different to traditional business challenges. And while continued digital advancement offers opportunities, it also breeds a more competitive playground. To help companies navigate this landscape and achieve smart, impactful growth, we spent 2022 improving the insights, capabilities, and data granularity within our solutions. We’ve been inspired to see our customers’ resilience and join them in celebrating successes. In data we trust In the digital world, the demand for more accurate and timely data is key to any business – big or small. Smarter data = smarter decision making. As well as adding 100+ new features, we worked tirelessly on enhancing the data in our platform to make it more timely and granular than ever before. “Thanks to Similarweb, we have been able to identify, enrich and segment our target market in order to inform our go-to-market strategy. Similarweb is the clear winner in terms of the data you get and the quality of that data.” Hannah Duncan – Director of Operations at Postscript Endorsements from independent bodies and figureheads are testament to both the improvements we’ve made and the robustness of our data. We were honored to pick up Best Alternative Data Provider in the Hedgeweek Americas Awards back in January. And marketing industry heavyweights, SparkToro, led a study that revealed Similarweb had the most accurate 3rd-party data for measuring website traffic. It’s all about you… At Similarweb, it’s our goal to solve companies’ biggest pain points – in fact in 2022 we delivered over 100 new features and enhancements. How did we decide what to do? We worked closely with you, our users, to get your most-asked-for features into Similarweb. “Similarweb helped my company expand its business to other countries by showing the size of the market as well as mapping out local competitors. Such a powerful platform, which enabled us to do all analysis in-house, saving a couple of thousands of dollars with consultancy or other solutions” – Paulo Ramazza, Senior Analytical Consultant at Google. Together, we’re stronger When it seems like change is the only constant in the world right now, we are proud to offer solutions that have near real-time data to give you an accurate view of how macro trends impact you and your industry. Whatever you do – staying on top of trends, competitors and using data to your advantage is the key to smart growth. We wish you all a successful 2023. by Or Offer CEO Or has led Similarweb since its founding in 2007, growing it from a small startup to a global company with over 1,000 employees.
