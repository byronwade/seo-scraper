September 6, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Today, I am excited and proud to announce we have launched Similarweb 3.0 – the complete Digital Intelligence platform for every business. Driven by the rapidly changing digital landscape and feedback from our customers, we’ve built the next generation of Similarweb. Having a single source of digital truth in real-time across teams is more important than ever, so we’re unlocking even more game-changing insights to power marketing and business growth. From identifying smarter marketing tactics to tracking real-time consumer habits and demand, Similarweb 3.0 is specifically designed to be your eyes, ears and strategic partner in an ever-changing digital world. Empowering businesses with 360° visibility across all digital ecosystems The past three years have brought about a profound transformation in the digital ecosystem, making it a more intensely competitive arena than ever before. With accelerated changes like consumer habits evolving overnight, new competitors emerging overnight, and technology disrupting – businesses are struggling to maintain market share, let alone grow it. So we have been working to deliver even more powerful tools and data to unlock more insights and growth opportunities in these tougher, unpredictable times – bringing marketing and business insights all in one place. Our users can now expect: Greater business impact with more customization and market visibility to answer pressing business questions and drive data-driven decisions Tailored packages for businesses of any size. Flexibility and scalability so you only pay for the features, services and data you need Enhanced data coverage and access: more sources, more granularity and more consumption methods giving you the most accurate and updated digital data, spanning over millions of new websites and mobile apps Reimagined support: multiple levels of service, from self-serve to advisory, to give your business the support it needs My top seven transformative new features and services We revealed the whole platform in a webinar on September 26. Ahead of that, I picked out what I consider to be the most impactful changes and additions we’ve made. Here are my top seven: 1. Introducing ‘Viewers’ and ‘Advanced Sharing’ for a single source of truth An issue I see in a lot of businesses is teams work in silos – especially within marketing and between executives and individual contributors. Data isn’t disseminated with the right people or at the right time, insights aren’t easily shared and collaborations can be missed. Similarweb 3.0 offers: viewer seats so you can easily share business insights, reports, and summaries with stakeholders or your wider organization, without the need for additional, full-platform users. Work with a single source of truth for digital data across your organization for better visibility, collaboration and alignment. Bonus: New advanced sharing options allow each dashboard, segment and custom industry to be ‘private’ by default. So you only share the data and dashboards where appropriate. 2. Experience our top-tier Client Services The challenge with any new software is setting you and your team up for success, quickly and efficiently. And when you’re up and running, new features, capabilities and datasets can sometimes pass you by. In many cases, when encountering an issue, the task of finding help or information proves harder than dealing with the issue itself. Similarweb 3.0 offers: Our client services are the best in the business and we’ve expanded our offering to include: Packaged tier and service options to match your business needs An individual onboarding experience within your first 90 days to set you up for success Online support, made up of our dedicated in-house experts (yes, real people), so your questions and issues never turn into problems. We also have a technical data services team for anything data/tech-related. A dedicated account manager as your point of contact A customer success team: designed to be your strategic partner. Specialists in your niche, they will share insights and ensure your success plan is met Professional Services: Partner with our Advisory Services team for unique and complex business needs, for example: brand health monitoring, consumer journey mapping, deep analysis of target audiences, brand performance on retail sites/apps, and more 3. Power up your SEO and PPC with Search Tracker It’s one thing to achieve a top spot on Google for a key term, it’s another to maintain it. The fight for share of voice is more competitive than ever, and it’s hard for SEO and PPC teams to keep up. Similarweb 3.0 offers: our brand new ‘Search Tracker’ comprising two new tools for search marketing teams. Firstly, for SEOs, Rank Tracker provides daily monitoring of organic SERP performance, with exceptional granularity and filter options to see drops, gains and cannibalization. Reports give in-depth, and competitive views of performance by tags, keywords and pages. My personal highlight is the SERP feature report, which is entirely unique to Similarweb and gives SEOs a true understanding of the SERP landscape and ranking opportunities available to them. Secondly, with Brand Protection, marketers get alerted to aggressive paid search plays on branded keywords. We let you know who is bidding on the terms that matter to you in the moment, so you can pivot and win back traffic that’s rightfully yours. As a leader, seeing other brands capitalize from my brand’s search terms is a huge pain point – and I am thrilled that our customers will now be able to better protect their brand with the help of this new feature. 4. Answer business critical questions with Market Intelligence Consumer needs change, markets change, and competitors change – this volatile and changing landscape means businesses without the right data can fall behind without realizing it. Similarweb 3.0 offers: our Market Intelligence feature-set gives business leaders the data and trackers to measure market change, benchmark performance and stay on top of changing consumer needs, trends and journeys. Perform deep analysis into market sizing and market difficulty, armed with data on customer loyalty, marketing spend and brand strength for your target market. 5. Drive more relevant insights with Custom Market Analysis Seeing the holistic performance of a website or set of websites is incredibly useful. But it’s not so useful if you want to analyze a particular category or market segment. Similarweb 3.0 offers: Website segments and custom industries to analyze categories, lines of business, or specific page types so you can glean meaningful insights from key digital metrics that your competitors miss. Segments was one of our most popular launches of 2022 and I’m happy to say we’ve opened it up to all Similarweb 3.0 packages. With Segments, you can dive into specific categories or page/content types and then analyze different metrics and insights. 6. Access the data you need, the way you want Data packages are often inflexible and you can end up paying for data you don’t consume. On top of this data extraction methods can be complex, technical and lack the speed and power to scale. Similarweb 3.0 offers: best-in-class data available via multiple views/extraction methods. We understand no organization is the same, so we’ve moved to a data-as-a-service model, where you can: Operate with data credits: Giving you full control over your Similarweb data usage and the flexibility to access any of our APIs and on-demand reporting tools, according to your needs Pick and choose from custom reports, our data exporter, Excel downloads, flexible and real-time APIs, or data feeds Get personalized assistance from support, or from our professional services available to pull and analyze data for complex business questions and needs Our APIs offer the broadest access to Similarweb data allowing you to integrate it directly into your workflows – a big efficiency driver for business: Purchase data credits to access our APIs (both REST and Batch) and choose from hundreds of metrics to support whatever project you’re working on. The data credit package comes with two API keys, so no selecting upfront, we’ve expanded access for everyone I am particularly proud of our data exporter – a new user-friendly interface for customized data extraction at scale. This will save our customers time, and resources and serve more specific and granular use cases. 7. Enterprise features to unlock scalability with security We recognize a lot of our enterprise clients have very specific needs, so we’ve worked to make our packages more scalable, our data more accessible and our platform more secure. Similarweb 3.0 offers: Additional security with two-factor authentication, SSO and log files Professional services team to analyze more complex business cases and questions Advanced market research features: popular pages for competitive research, website segments for granular analysis, and customized market analysis and benchmarking There’s even more to unlock I struggled to choose the top picks of Similarweb 3.0, because everything our updated platform offers in terms of data, features, UX and customer service is game-changing. Other key features of note are: Small sites: analyze websites with 5,000 or less visitors per month Fresher data: We’ve unlocked more real-user data for our marketers. See your competitors’ performance with unrivaled granularity, spot trends and see brand new keywords as and when they’re searched for Dashboards: Track the websites and metrics that matter to you with ease with a custom dashboard or one of the pre-made templates App intelligence: Access our vast app data to uncover customer behavior, market leaders, daily performance and opportunities Homepage and sidebar: Increase your speed to insights with this revamp. New onboarding wizards and ‘recently viewed’ help make your Similarweb journey smooth The future of Digital Intelligence is waiting for you Be among the first to unlock the full potential of Similarweb for your business. Our mission is to equip you with the tools and insights to make better-informed decisions to power growth in your business.
