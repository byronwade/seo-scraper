September 24, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Having the best data at your fingertips is make-or-break when it comes to leading your market. However, when relying on poor data, the cost to your business may be higher than you realize. This is why Similarweb continuously strives to improve our data so that we can provide the most accurate and actionable digital intelligence available. As CTO at Similarweb, implementing this data update was a key objective for me and my team to ensure that our customers have access to the best data and a clear path into the digital world. We dramatically increased domain, keywords, brands, and product coverage and implemented enhancements to our models for improved accuracy across all web datasets and metrics. Now, businesses can create strategies and make strategic decisions based on the most comprehensive and valuable digital insights possible. On a roll Since 2013, Similarweb’s mission has been to map every corner of the digital world. We process tens of billions of digital signals gathered daily into an ultra-high-resolution picture of everything happening online. In July, our substantial improvements and enhancements sprang to life. Here’s how we did it. Enhanced modeling Similarweb’s data methodology is paramount, and it’s all about the blend. We use a multidimensional approach to ensure that every data point we estimate is both reliable and representative of a site’s traffic and usage. Our unique mix of digital signals obtained from various sources allows us to measure and map the digital world in a timely and comprehensive way. We’ve made several important updates across our web methodology: Data Collection: We improved the scale, diversity, and quality of the data we ingest by better utilizing existing and new data sets. Data Synthesis: We enhanced the authenticity of our data by enhancing consistency and filtering out bot-generated traffic. Data Modeling: We implemented better benchmarking of our estimations to mirror Google’s recent transition to GA4, allowing our customers to see a much more “realistic” representation of the web, specifically their industry, competitors, and their own position. Traffic Intelligence: We optimized our estimation to provide the most accurate trends, and now, with the new data version, we are also enhancing the scale accuracy. More data, more insights This new data version brings immense improvements by significantly enhancing the quality and reliability of the data we provide our customers, giving them the most comprehensive and accurate traffic & engagement estimates of the web. What you get: Expanded coverage We’ve significantly increased the number of domains we track, over 30 million new domains to be exact, including long-tail sites and smaller sites that usually have fewer than 5000 monthly visits. This means we now cover a much broader section of the internet, providing a more comprehensive view. Improved precision and accuracy New advanced filtering and improved algorithms ensure your strategic decisions are based on the most precise and reliable metrics available. In fact, all core metrics (Website Visits, Bounce Rate, and Global Rank, among others) have improved significantly, guaranteeing trend consistency, scale accuracy, and stability. Increased global coverage The millions of new domains added enhanced our global data collection, allowing for better insights from more regions crucial for our customers with a global presence. North America: +9.9M new websites across two regions LATAM: +5.9M new websites across 21 regions EMEA: +8.3 new websites across 78 regions APAC: +6.6M new websites across 20 regions Dig into the digital data We are committed to you, our customers.
