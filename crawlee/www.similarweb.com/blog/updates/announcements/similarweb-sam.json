April 18, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Last year I wrote about SimilarAsk, a revolutionary AI milestone we crossed in the pursuit of bringing you the most state-of-the-art and cutting-edge solution. Today, I am pleased to announce we are rolling out new AI capabilities to further advance how our platform is used. Introducing the Similarweb Sales AI Module—or SAM—which combines Similarweb’s unique Digital Data and a touch of AI magic to create the ultimate assistant for every sales team. Sales has never been more complex than it is now. Your target audience is inundated with offers; it’s easier for them to simply ignore all the noise. SAM is our answer to the leading question on sales professionals’ minds: “How do I cut through the noise and establish my business as the clear solution for my prospect?” Unlike other co-pilots in the market, SAM has the unique capability of delivering to you account-tailored insights in ready-to-use message copy that will undeniably resonate with your prospects — you’ll close more deals, more often. In short, SAM distinguishes your business as the right solution for your prospect and turns leads into clients. Tweet this Similarweb empowers you to sell smarter and win faster New AI technologies continue to shape the digital and business landscape. While many products will emerge promising to unlock growth, most will rely on basic web scraping and public data. This simply can’t compete with Similarweb’s industry-leading website traffic & engagement data. To empower your sales team in this AI-driven era, you need the only sales assistant with insights fueled by Similarweb’s Digital Data, enabling them to pinpoint high-impact opportunities and build trust through data-driven, consultative selling. Our mission is and has always been to empower every online business with reliable and timely data that enables them to win their market; SAM is no exception. Working with SAM will be like working with the most insightful and knowledgeable researcher who prepares you with a detailed analysis before every meeting, an outbound messaging expert who knows exactly what you should say to grab the attention of your prospect, and an assistant who keeps an eye on every detail in your accounts so you can consistently provide value to your customers. This is why I’m sharing with you an exclusive invitation to be among the first to work with SAM and experience the difference its prospect-tailored insights can make. Starting today, the SAM beta is open to everyone, not just current Similarweb customers. If you’re not yet a Similarweb customer – complete this form to join the waitlist. Once approved, you will be notified via email. Close more deals, more often. Meet SAM.
