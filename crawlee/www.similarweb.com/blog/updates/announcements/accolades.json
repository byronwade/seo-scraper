The world is our (digital) oyster, and we’re reaping the benefits of all our hard work. We’re continuing to make lots of improvements to our market intelligence platform, in addition to new feature updates and more. Recently, we were honored to receive the Red Herring top 100 technology award. This award is bestowed upon the top 100 startup companies and private ventures in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. We were thrilled to win this award, as it’s another icon that reflects how much we’ve grown and achieved in such a short amount of time. In the last year the company has accelerated into advanced rapid-growth mode. We’ve hired an additional 70 people in the past few months to join the sales, marketing, support, R&D and product departments (to name a few). Needless to say, all of these people are amazing and we’re glad to have them along for the ride. But the good news doesn’t end there. Our VP of sales, Etai Rosen, was shortlisted for a Digital Masters Award, for Excellence in Commercial Management. The Digital Masters Awards pay tribute to Europe’s top leaders in the digital fields. Etai is a Similarweb veteran. He helped lay the foundation for the marketing and sales teams. When Etai joined, we didn’t yet have a product. Undeterred, he built the pricing model, the go-to-market strategy, and the sales team from the ground up. Etai set up the UK office and was crucial to growing the sales team from 0-20 in a matter of months. He also had a huge part in building the marketing team and developing a strong marketing presence that garnered the interest of publications worldwide, many of which now use Similarweb’s insights in their stories. Etai’s fundraising efforts and work with the sales team ultimately helped the company’s profits soar in just a little over a year. In short, his impact on Similarweb has been nothing short of remarkable. The winner of the Digital Master’s award will be announced later today, but Etai is already a winner in our book. And we’re not just saying that to flatter – we’re giving credit where credit is due. Our whole company is comprised of similarly-minded people (no pun intended), whose efforts and passion for what they do have helped propel Similarweb into the stratosphere of premium market intelligence. We’re redefining the standard for digital measurement, and it’s thanks to our devoted employees that we continue to excel in this arena. So to all our team, 150 strong and growing: We can’t thank you enough. Onward and upward! by Lauren Meir Lauren is a writer with a background in content marketing and creative branding.
