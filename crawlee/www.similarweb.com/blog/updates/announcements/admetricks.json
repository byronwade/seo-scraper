March 4, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Today’s acquisition of Admetricks, a leading ad intelligence platform, is a major milestone for Similarweb. This strategic move is a game-changer, reinforcing our commitment to offering a comprehensive and powerful digital marketing and advertising intelligence solution. Empowering Global Growth Best known as a regional solution for advertisers who want to increase their reach and effectiveness in the Latin American market, Admetricks has created digital advertising intelligence software that deserves to go global. Our vision is to integrate it into the Similarweb platform to create the most comprehensive ad intelligence platform on the planet. Strength in Diversity Similarweb has been a front-runner in providing top-notch analytics tools for search advertising, organic SEO, and retail advertising. Admetricks will further strengthen our capabilities in analyzing online display advertising, a sector estimated to attract $174.4 billion in spending in 2024, according to Statista. Every advertiser wants to ensure that their money is well spent, and we can help. Benchmarking Excellence Like Similarweb, Admetricks allows you to not only see your own performance but benchmark it against the competition and use that intelligence to optimize your own campaigns. They offer an Ad Intelligence product for competitive intelligence and market analysis, as well as a Media Planner for campaign planning and budgeting. This explainer video (also available in Spanish and Portuguese) will give you a better idea of their approach, which closely matches ours. Global Innovation Hub Founded in 2012 in Santiago, Chile, Admetricks provides more proof that digital innovation can come from anywhere in the world. As the founder of a company that started in Israel, went public in the US, and serves customers from around the world, I feel a kinship with this team of “data lovers” who are such a great match for the Similarweb vision and culture. Operational Continuity In the near term, Admetricks will continue to operate under its own brand, serving its existing customers, and we welcome their expertise in Spanish and Portuguese digital media. Admetricks manages some of the largest brands, agencies and publishers who do business in Latin America, as well as some who target Spanish-speaking audiences in the US and other countries. Integrated Intelligence What I’m most looking forward to is the integration of Admetricks’ technology into the global and multilingual Similarweb platform. They use some of our data in their product already, giving our respective tech teams a head start on the integration. We intend for Admetricks’ technology to form the core of a forthcoming Similarweb Ad Intelligence product, positioning us to help: Brands and agencies better plan their digital ad strategy and media spend Publishers more effectively monetize their audience All parties gain insights on ads, campaigns, advertisers, and industries Marketing and advertising professionals need to understand the relative strengths of display and search advertising, and we can help them find the right balance. In addition, we expect improved ad effectiveness data to be a component of our solutions for Sales Intelligence, Shopper Intelligence, Stock Intelligence, and more. Navigating the Digital Landscape Knowing how and when to advertise, effectively and cost-efficiently, is an essential component of success in the digital world. Stay tuned for product announcements to follow.
