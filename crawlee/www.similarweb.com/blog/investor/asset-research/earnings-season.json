So, the perfect gift … Similarweb Stock Intelligence, alternative digital data tailored to public market investors. It allows you to uncover new opportunities, track target companies, and forecast stock performance. It’s everything you could possibly want for earnings season and, of course, the non-reported periods. Earnings season comes but 4 times a year Tis the season. Companies start reporting earnings about two weeks into the start of every quarter. There is no official end to earnings season, but it does start winding down after about six weeks as these companies start the paperwork for next quarter’s earnings. Earnings season is important to investors because it provides key financial information like revenue, profit, earnings per share, and an array of other pertinent metrics that provide key insights into a company’s performance and financial health. These investors and analysts then closely examine the numbers. Some companies are scrutinized even more closely because they are thought to represent the overall health of the stock market. The earnings season gift that is Stock Intelligence Similarweb Stock Intelligence takes the best digital data and tailors it so that investors can surface accessible and actionable insights. The data includes: Sector intelligence: Comprehensive coverage across Consumer, Ecommerce, SaaS, TMT, and Travel & Entertainment Web performance: Traffic & Engagement, Marketing Channels (web traffic sources), and Mobile Apps Client growth and performance: Web page level data (segments), tech stack data (technographics), and website structure data (subdomains & folders); and Top line tracking: backtested models, built by a team of internal analysts, with proven accuracy With this, Investors are able to get a true 360-degree analysis of every target company’s digital landscape. Custom Web Traffic Heatmaps Sector macro trends are key to understanding how portfolio companies will perform over a given quarter and provides insight into what will be featured in earnings reports. The how and why of consumer and business spending are key to this analysis. One way is to look at traffic to a sampling of websites across a selection of industries in a specific sector. Stock Intelligence standard web traffic heatmaps cover millions of domains across 130 industries and 28 sectors, which allows investors to spot emerging trends quickly. The Travel & Entertainment sector is a good example. Comparing 4- and 12-week trends, Entertainment industry traffic has jumped 11.8%. This industry includes the websites for Ticketmaster, Live Nation, Eventbrite, Stubhub, SeatGeek, and AXS. Are these companies not in line with your investment strategy? Don’t worry. Heatmaps are the gift that keeps on giving. You can easily build your own heatmap to track current portfolio companies and future opportunities. With a customized heatmap, you can convert Entertainment into its own sector and add industries like event ticketing, amusement parks, movie theaters, restaurants, and venues — whatever aligns with your investment strategy. Based on the chosen domains, global traffic for Movie Theaters and Ticketing has been rising, up 22.3% and 6.5%, respectively, over the recent two-week period. When it comes to entertainment, consumers show where they are interested in spending, especially when compared to restaurant traffic, which is down 26.4% over the same time period. This is only the beginning of your sector analysis. You can track each industry by: Region: APAC, EMEA, LATAM, AU/NZ, North America, and Western Europe Domain: See which domains account for the majority of the traffic in the sector Granularity: Display two weeks vs. one month with 4- and 12-week visit averages and three years of history Need to incorporate the data into standing reports? Downloadable Excel files are at the ready. Mobile app data Apple’s app store launched in 2008. The tech giant coined the phrase “There’s an app for that” in 2009. Today, mobile apps have changed how companies do business. In many cases, apps drive revenue growth. Without app data, you can’t have a 360-degree view of a company’s performance, causing a gap in your analysis. That’s why this data is available with Stock Intelligence. The mobile app data comes from two sources: Google and Apple, the two largest app stores worldwide. The metrics fall into three categories: Growth Install Penetration: the average market penetration rate across devices in a defined market Store downloads Engagement Daily Active Users (DAUs) Weekly Active Users (WAUs) Monthly Active Users (MAUs) Usage Sessions Per User Average Session Time Total Session Time That’s a significant amount of data. Here’s how it works. Over the course of a year, unique visits to netflix.com were between 233M and 257M each month. During that same time frame, app downloads were positive year-over-year (YoY) over the last 6 months. May 2024 was up 26.3% YoY, and August 2024 was up 14% YoY. Globally, aside from slight increases in February, April, and June, app installation was down YoY over the last 12 months, reaching its low in August 2024, down 2.4% YoY. You can take the analysis a step further and look at Install Penetration regionally during August 2024: Japan: Up 1.1% YoY India: Down 2.3% YoY Mexico: Up 1.6% YoY UK: Down 2.9% YoY US: Down 3.5% YoY The company reported an increase of 8M subscribers in 2Q24 and could post a similar result in 3Q24. EasyDash Stock Intelligence covers over 200 tickers with built-in signals, curated based on the digital datasets our team of analysts found to correlate strongly with a company’s reported KPIs and earnings. While each ticker has its own dashboard for in-depth analysis across all relevant domains and subsidiaries, there’s now a unified dashboard, updated monthly, that showcases all the signals and accompanying data for these 200+ companies and their industries and sectors in one place – the EasyDash. This dashboard provides the top line tracking with ready-to-use, backtested models with an average R2 of 96%. Go ahead. Read that again. You can access signals that indicate what happened during the current quarter and forecast what will happen next quarter by filtering through options for trending data, consensus magnitude, and industry-wide comparisons. EasyDash has five different views: KPI dashboard: View of a single KPI for the specified ticker Company KPI breakdown: View all the KPIs for the specified ticker Industry KPI breakdown: Displays all KPIs for a given industry Industry watch: Displays index trends within an industry segment and expected surprise for that KPI, rank-ordered Screener: Enables custom filtering for the entire universe of tracked KPIs Within the KPI dashboard, company KPI breakdown, and Industry KPI breakdown, there are six signals: KPI Quarterly signal Monthly signal Acceleration/Deceleration Tracker Directional Tracker Backtested Growth Model For each KPI, the Screener displays: Directional Call-Out and Confidence Variance Call-Out and Confidence Index Trend ( 3 vs. 6 months) Next 3 months’ comps R2 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Beat/Miss score Stock Runup All of that data in a single dashboard. Let’s use the SaaS sector as an example to see how it works. Snowflake (SNOW), the cloud-based data warehouse and platform that helps businesses store, analyze, and share data, has three KPIs tracked by Stock Intelligence by specific metrics that indicate performance: Product Revenue ↔️ Desktop Unique Visits Customers ↔️ Desktop Unique Visits Remaining Performance Obligation ↔️ Aggregate Duration Each of these KPIs represents a percentage of the company’s revenue, and you can track monthly and quarterly performance. Since the beginning of 2023, the Similarweb Signal has tracked in line with SNOW’s reported numbers: Monthly Signal: The reported Product Revenue KPI in July 2024 was up 30% YoY, and the Similarweb Signal, tracking Desktop Unique Visits, was up 32% Quarterly Signal: The reported Product Revenue KPI and the Similarweb Signal tracking Desktop Unique Visits were even, up 30% YoY in 2Q24. Do you want to know how SNOW compares to its competitors? No problem. This is build into EasyDash for ease of analysis. Over recent quarters, neither Zoom (ZM), Okta (OKTA), or Monday (MNDY), saw a dramatic increase or decrease in its current customer engagement with their websites. SNOW, however, did see a slight uptick in usage in 3Q24, where the others stayed relatively stable. The Similarweb Index, comparing the most recent month with the last three months, dives into how SNOW has performed against other big names in the SaaS sector and reveals current sector trends. The gift that keeps on giving Earnings season brings a wave of revenue numbers, performance data, management outlooks, and next-quarter projections.
