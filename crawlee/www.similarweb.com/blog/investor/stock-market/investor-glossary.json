Stock Market Terms A – D A Alpha An indicator used to inform investors of the performance of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Alpha is also known as risk measurement. For instance, if alpha is zero, it means that the return on investment is precisely as anticipated according to the risk. Alpha higher than zero indicates that the investment outperformed the known risks in the market. ARR Short for annual recurring revenue. ARR is a key metric used by SaaS or subscription businesses that have term subscription agreements. This means there is a defined contract length, and it is calculated like this: ARR = (Overall Subscription Cost Per Year + Recurring Revenue From Add-ons or Upgrades) – Revenue Lost from Cancellations. Read more about ARR here. Asset An item or group of items owned by an individual or company that can be valued in monetary terms. Real estate, equipment, inventory, cash accounts, and investments are examples of assets. A typical balance sheet will show assets and liabilities. Assets such as brand recognition and customer base improve a company’s performance. However, since they cannot be measured in currency, they are not included on the balance sheet. B Balance Sheet One of the principal documents used to evaluate the financial health of a business or individual. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of assets, shareholder equity, and liabilities for a given period, such as annually or quarterly. A balance sheet is sometimes referred to as a statement of net worth. Bear Market A bear market denotes an extensive and sustained downward trend in the stock market. Stock prices must fall at least 20% from their peak price before it’s called a bear market. Loss of consumer confidence and pessimistic economic forecasting leading to stock sell-offs can trigger a bear market. We experienced the shortest bear market in history back in March 2020 after the stock market cratered 33%- with the coronavirus the immediate trigger for plunging prices. However, the bear market only lasted for one month before global stock markets re-entered a bull market in April. Beta Beta measures a stock’s volatility versus the market. The S&P 500 has a beta of 1.0, so a beta over 1.0 indicates a stock is more volatile than the market. Beta can also be used to indicate risk as high beta stocks are seen as offering higher risk, but with greater return potential. Blue Chip An investment term that derives from poker, blue chip is a company with a reputation for profitability, reliability, and consistent profitability. Examples of blue-chip stocks include Disney, Coca-Cola, and Intel. Bond A bond is an investment security issued by a government or business for a specified length of time, with a promise of fixed interest payments. When the bond matures, the issuer returns the investor’s money. The most common example of this type of security is government bonds sold to finance major infrastructure projects. Some investors prefer bonds because they tend to carry a lower risk than stocks. Bounce Rate The percentage of visitors who enter a site and then leave after visiting only one page. Bounce rate is a key data point for understanding how well a site is retaining traffic sent from different traffic channels. Similarweb calculates bounce rate by dividing the single-page sessions by all sessions. To learn more, see ‘Bounce Rate: Understanding, Measuring, and Tracking for Growth?‘. Broker A broker facilitates transactions, serving as an agent between the stock market and investor. A broker can be an individual or a company and must be licensed. An investor entrusts the broker to offer professional investment advice and act in his best interests. Brokers usually earn a commission based on a percentage of the deal’s value, or in some cases, they earn a flat fee based on performance. Bull Market In opposition to a bear market, a bull market describes a time when the economy is healthy, and stock prices are steadily rising, with all indicators pointing to continued improvement. Investor confidence leads to more buying, boosting stock prices. Economists look for stock prices to rise at least 20% above their most recent low before calling it a bull market. Investors have just enjoyed the longest bull market in modern history, from 2009 to March 2020. During these 10+ years, the S&P 500 rose a whopping 330%. C Capital All durable resources owned by a business that can be used to generate revenue are defined as capital. This includes tangible items such as buildings, equipment, land, machinery, stocks, cash, and intangible items such as patents and trademarks. Capital can also refer to a business’ wealth defined by subtracting total liabilities from its total assets. CAC Short for the customer acquisition cost. CAC is the total cost of acquiring a new customer. It should generally include things like advertising costs, salaries of your marketers and salespeople, costs of selling, etc., divided by the number of customers acquired. Churn Rate The rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. To calculate a company’s churn rate, do the following equation: (customers beginning of the month – customers end of the month) / customers beginning of the month = churn rate. Consumer Person or entity who consumes a product or service. Conversion Rate Measures the effectiveness of a company’s website at converting traffic into transactions. Conversion rate is an essential metric to track because it feeds directly into revenue. The higher the conversion rate, the better the company is generating value from its website traffic– which should make its business more sustainable in the long run. Cross-Selling Sales technique used to get a customer to spend more by purchasing a product that’s related to what is being bought already. Customer Lifetime Value The total worth of a customer over the period of the relationship. To calculate it, you need to calculate the average purchase value, and then multiply that number by the average purchase frequency rate to determine customer value. Then, once you calculate the average customer lifespan, you can multiply that by customer value to determine customer lifetime value. D DAU Short for Daily Active Users. The number of users who engage with an app or website daily. The metric shows the average number of daily active users in a given timeframe. DAU reflects a company’s growth potential and indicates the stickiness of its product or service. Demographic The study and statistical recording of the population in a given area, which, in web analytics, is usually a website or app. In website analysis, the metric measures engagement rate parameters, such as gender and age within the group. Direct Listing A direct listing, also known as a direct placement or direct public offering, enables a company to go public without holding an IPO. This means that the company does not have to hire banks to underwrite the transaction. Did you know that a recent ruling by the SEC now allows companies to list new shares via direct listing, rather than just existing shares? You can read more about this controversial new ruling here. ‘This is a game-changer for our capital markets, leveling the playing field for everyday investors and providing companies with another path to go public’ stated NYSE President Stacey Cunningham on December 22, 2020, after the SEC announced its decision. Dividend Dividend refers to a company’s distribution of earnings to its shareholders, paid out in cash, stocks, or another form of monetary value. This is the return on investment for those who have funded a business or financial entity’s operations. Large dividends indicate a healthy operation, which in turn attracts more investors. Dividends are usually paid quarterly or semi-annually. Dow Jones Index Among all the indexes used to measure US stocks’ performance on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones Index is the best known and most used. Named for its creator, Charles H. Dow, the Dow, also known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), indexes 30 companies in the technology, financial, transportation, communications, healthcare, food & beverage, transportation, and consumer sectors. Stock Market Terms E – K E Earnings Simply put, earnings are the net profit of a business. It is derived by subtracting the total operating expenses, taxes, and the cost of sales from total revenues. Earnings are an important indicator of a company’s profitability and stock value. At Similarweb, we provide traffic data for every company and industry that has an online presence. We use this data to generate valuable insights into a company’s key metrics before it reports earnings. For example, we can use Facebook’s website traffic to analyze whether its Monthly Active Users (MAUs) have increased or decreased during the quarter. We can also look at visits to its ad page to drive insights into how the company’s ad sales performed vs the previous quarter and on a year-over-year basis. You can check out some of our latest pre-earnings insights here. EBITDA Short for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. EBITDA is an alternative formula used to assess a company’s financial performance. Discretionary factors such as capital structure and debt financing are removed from the calculation, focusing on the performance of the company’s core operations. EBIT EBIT refers to Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. EBIT usually shows up just before “net income” on a company’s income statement. Often referred to as “operating earnings,” the formula excludes taxes and interest payments to calculate a company’s profitability. EPS Here we have EPS, or Earnings Per Share. EPS is one way to measure a company’s profitability and future growth potential. EPS is typically calculated by subtracting preferred dividends from the company’s net income and dividing that by the total share outstanding in any given period. ETF Short for Exchange Traded Fund, ETFs are similar to mutual funds in that they are an investment basket of bonds, stocks, and other financial assets. However, unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be traded on the stock market throughout the day, rather than waiting until the market closes. ETFs usually use the S&P Composite Stock Price Index. Equities Similar to shares or stocks, equities are units of ownership in multiple companies. However, unlike stocks, equity value is calculated after subtracting liabilities. Ex-Dividend Refers to the time between when an investment payment is published and when it is received, usually a difference of one business day. Investors buying stock on or after the ex-dividend date will need to wait until the next cycle before receiving a dividend payment. F FAANG An abbreviation for the top five US tech companies: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. It’s a popular acronym used by investment advisors when recommending high-yield tech stocks. FCF Stands for “free cash flow” i.e. the cash a company has available for distribution. It is calculated like this: cash from operations – capital expenditures. Federal Funds Rate (Fed Funds Rate) When banks borrow from each other, the interest they charge each other is set according to the feds fund rate. The Federal Reserve influences the interest rate charged on mortgages, credit cards, personal loans, and other types of borrowing. Federal Reserve Board (The Fed) The Fed Reserve is an agency of the US government tasked with setting monetary policies, ensuring the nation’s financial system’s stability, creating mechanisms to ensure transparency in currency markets and banking practices, and protecting consumers and community development. All segments of the economy follow the actions of the Fed Reserve. Fund Refers to the pooling of money from a group of investors, intending to maximize returns for the Fund’s benefit. The most common examples are mutual funds, equity funds, Hedge funds, money-market funds, Index funds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Funds are managed by expert investment advisors or brokerage houses. Forecasting The process of estimating future sales. Accurate sales forecasts enable companies to make informed business decisions and predict short-term and long-term performance. Companies can base their forecasts on past sales data, industry-wide comparisons, and other external factors such as economic trends. G Growth Stock Company shares that exceed market expectations based on the average performance in the industry are known as a growth stock. Typically, businesses will reinvest the earnings from growth stock back into their operating capital. This strategy empowers them to scale their business operations more quickly and provide better returns to their shareholders. H Hedge Fund A vehicle for investing, similar to a mutual fund, but riskier. Hedge Fund membership is typically restricted to investors with higher income levels because of the risk and expensive management fees. Hedge funds are established as a limited liability company or a limited partnership and are managed by licensed investment advisors.

Index Fund refers to an investment vehicle through which a pool of investors’ money can be used to purchase stocks and other securities that reflect a certain Index. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund is an example. An index fund can be an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a mutual fund. Inflation When the price of goods and services across all industrial sectors gradually increases to the point of depressing consumers’ purchasing power, the economy is considered to be in a period of inflation. It is also referred to as a rising cost of living. Periodic inflation is healthy but left unchecked, it can flatten a country’s economy. Interest Rate The cost of borrowing money or earnings received from lending money. For example, banks pay interest to savings accounts and certificates of deposit holders. Lenders charge interest to borrowers. The interest rate fluctuates according to several factors. IPO Short for Initial Public Offering.

Employees and investors who already held stock benefit from the ability to trade their shares on the market. Find our coverage of the market’s hottest upcoming IPOs here. L Large Cap A designation is given to companies whose market capitalization exceeds $10 billion. Large-cap stocks are issued by well-established, mega-size companies that can weather disruptions in the economy. Large-cap stocks are a safe investment, though returns tend to be smaller. LSE Stands for London Stock Exchange, the third-largest exchange in the world. More than 3,000 companies from across China, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America are represented on the LSE. Logo Retention The percentage of customers retained over a given period of time. M Market Channels The channel sources that generate traffic to any website. This data can quickly reveal a site’s desktop and mobile traffic acquisition strategy. For example, direct traffic will often come from people with an awareness of, or affinity for, a given site. This means that visitors from Direct are likely to be amongst some of the website’s most loyal and engaged users. So you can use this metric to assess a website’s brand strength (awareness and demand). Mid Cap Companies whose market value falls between $2 billion and $10 billion are referred to as Mid-Cap companies. These companies have not yet made it to the big leagues, but they have established a foothold in their industry and exhibit growth potential. Mid-cap stocks fall between large-cap and small-cap. Mega Cap A designation is given to any company whose market capitalization exceeds $200 billion. Mega cap stocks are also known as blue-chip stocks. Mega cap stock prices are among the most expensive on the market, excluding small investors. However, they enjoy the best price stability due to their popularity with mutual and hedge funds. MRR Short for monthly recurring revenue. MRR is income that a business can count on receiving every single month, predictable revenue. To calculate MRR, multiply your total number of paying users by the average revenue per user. Mutual Fund A mutual fund is a vehicle for easily investing in the stock market.

The Sharpe ratio considers the issue of risk. In other words, the return achieved is measured against the risk taken. The higher the ratio, the riskier the investment strategy. For investors looking for safer investments, the Sharpe ratio provides some guidance. Small Cap Unlike big-cap stocks, small-cap stocks are owned by companies whose market capitalization is no more than $2 billion, with a minimum of approximately $300 million. A younger company with less operational overhead can be an attractive investment since there is more room for significant profits down the road. On the other hand, small-cap stocks are a bit riskier. SMB SMB means small and medium-sized businesses (as opposed to SME which stands for small and medium-sized enterprises). Gartner defines small businesses as organizations with fewer than 100 employees and under $50 million in annual revenue. Midsize businesses have 100-999 employees and make between $50 million to $1 billion in annual revenue.

It is calculated in real-time by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) based on the expected price fluctuations in the S&P 500 Index options over the next 30 days. Volatility Simply put, volatility is a measure of price swing (range and speed) over a given period of time. Certain assets are naturally more volatile. Financial analysts measure the market, securities, and index volatility when evaluating investing strategies. Y Yield The return on an investment, minus capital gains. Yield is stated as an annual percentage, calculated based on the purchase price of the security. Generally, one takes the dividends or interest received over a period of time and divides it by the original amount invested. Alternatively, the current price might be used. Knowing dividend yield is an important factor to consider before investing in stocks. YOY Short for year-over-year. It is a way of analyzing performance by comparing financial data in one period to the same period the previous year. The period can be a quarter or a month.
