Klarna IPO Expected IPO date:2021. Company Description: Fintech company specializing in buy now pay later (BNPL), headquartered in Sweden There has been lots of speculation around a potential IPO from Klarna, which according to TechCrunch is the highest valued private fintech in Europe. The Swedish buy now pay later (BNPL) company is live in over 20 countries, and in May 2021 reported 90 million global active users, and 2 million transactions a day. This could be an exciting IPO to get involved in. Klarna operates in an expanding market, signaling high growth potential. This is a great signal ahead of a potential upcoming IPO. The number of websites globally with either Klarna or Afterpay installed, is increasing. In 2Q21 this growth represented 16.8% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), and 65.5% year-over-year (YoY). The market is strong, but can Klarna keep up with the market? Robinhood IPO Expected IPO date: Q3 2021 Company Description: Commission-free investment platform for retail investors (regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission) Targeting millennials, Robinhood is on a mission to “democratize finance for all.” Following a confidential initial public offering (IPO) filing in March, Robinhood, the commission-free investing platform, publicly filed for its IPO with the SEC on July 1. The company will be listed on NASDAQ under the ticker HOOD and expects to raise $100 million in its debut onto the public markets. According to the New York Post, Robinhood has hired Goldman Sachs as the underwriters for its IPO. This is a highly anticipated IPO, and we can see why.

Download the full Robinhood analysis Instacart IPO IPO date expectation: 2021 Company Description: Grocery delivery and pick up service in the U.S. and Canada Instacart is one of those businesses that has benefited from COVID-19, as the public attempted to avoid supermarkets and other busy public areas, especially during the height of the pandemic. The company raised $200 million in October 2020 bringing total funding to $2.4 billion and valuing the company at $30 billion. So what’s going on online? The number of monthly unique visitors to instacart.com, a proxy for monthly active users of the service, in the U.S. peaked in May but continues to be on the rise. In 3Q20, the site experienced 96% YoY growth in unique visitors.

All customers need to do is spit into a tube. The company is also on a mission to disrupt what it believes to be a dysfunctional healthcare system, and provide a personal approach to healthcare. And finally the company has partnered with Glaxosmithkline (GSK) to use its DNA database for drug discovery. 23andMe is entering the public markets via a merger with blank-check firm VG Acquisition Corp (NYSE:VGAC.U), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) founded by Virgin Group’s Sir Richard Branson. Once the 23andME SPAC goes ahead, the newly formed public entity will trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the ticker symbol ME. The deal that will take 23andMe public values the merged entity at $3.5 billion according to CNBC. So what does the alternative web data have to say about 23andMe? Traffic to 23andme.com has been experiencing an upward trend since April 2020. In almost a year, the number of site visits globally has increased by 78% (from 5.5 million to 9.8 million).

The company is yet to report a profit, but did report impressive total revenue for 2020 of $161 million. Let’s see what the data has to say about the company. Monthly visits to monday.com are experiencing an upward trend, showing the platform’s increased popularity. February saw the highest number of monthly visits to the site to date, at 20.1 million, and YoY growth in 1Q21 was 63.7%. The positive trajectory for site visits is encouraging, but how does monday.com fair against its competition?

So the company has decided that 2021 is the year it will re-enter the public markets. Petco filed its S-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 3 2020. There is some uncertainty from investors over this IPO, so we have used alternative data to gain insight into the digital performance of the company. Monthly visits to petco.com in the U.S. are significantly lower than competitor chewy.com, however YoY growth is higher for petcom.com.

Investing in IPOs IPOs are often highly anticipated and talked about with excitement before they actually list. An IPO is only confirmed once the pricing and date have been finalized and the company has announced which exchange it will be listed on (Nasdaq, NYSE etc.). Some of the most anticipated IPOs in the past few years include: Slack – went public in April 2019 at $38.5 per share Uber – went public in May 2019 at $42 per share Peloton – went public in September 2019 at $26-$29 per share Asana (ticker ASAN) and DoorDash (ticker DASH), that both listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) were just two of the highly anticipated IPOs that came to the stock market at the latter end of 2020. Why alternative data is useful for IPOs Alternative data refers to data used by investors that are not within their traditional data sources (public company disclosures, sell-side research etc). It is the answer investors are looking for to address the pain points of using only traditional sources for investment decisions, and when it comes to upcoming IPOs, where there can be such limited information about the company, alternative datasets are even more valuable.
