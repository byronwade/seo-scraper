I can picture it now. You squinted your eyes, moved in for a closer look, and pushed your nose against the screen. Did it help? No? What happens when you look at this? I can picture it now, the lightbulb above your head as you scan the data and sector macro trends become clearer. Web traffic in the BNPL sector was steady, and Cloud and Audio Streaming traffic increased. A clear picture cultivated from alternative data. The amount of data in front of you takes time and resources to analyze. That’s where the value of heatmaps comes in. What are heatmaps? A heatmap is a graphical representation of data that utilizes colors to represent different values. A heatmap can be used to represent a wide variety of data sets, from unemployment rates to real estate and, of course, web traffic. A great example of a heatmap, is Similarweb’s web traffic heatmaps. These were originally created to track consumer recovery across multiple sectors and took off from there, with deeper and broader coverage in sync with the rapidly evolving pace of online innovation. What are the benefits of heatmaps? Data visualization is a key benefit of heatmaps. This allows anyone to understand what the data is saying without having to dig through rows upon rows of numbers. The news media uses them frequently. A perfect example is during election coverage, like this one from the New York Times published during the 2018 midterm elections. Red equals Republicans, and blue represents Democrats, and readers get a good feel for the makeup of the country and how they may vote come election day. How do investors use heatmaps? The subject of the heatmap will determine how investors use it. Stock heatmaps allow investors to make informed decisions by identifying stocks that meet specific criteria, such as the highest or lowest returns, highest volume, or strongest price momentum. Overall portfolio analysis is an investment heatmap commonly used. Investors can visualize the performance of different assets or securities held within a portfolio, not just over a single time frame, but over all time frames to quickly identify areas of high risk and adjust accordingly.
