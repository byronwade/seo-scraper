January 13, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic With the number of monthly listeners expected to reach nearly 118 million in the U.S., podcasts are a great marketing and traffic-generating tool for businesses, particularly those in eCommerce. Understanding the most popular ones and their audience can also boost the media buying strategy. To help these stakeholders effectively tap into podcasts to boost revenue, we used Similarweb Digital Research Intelligence to analyze the best eCommerce podcasts and their related websites. Why should you care about eCommerce podcasts? Simply put, a popular podcast can put your brand on the map. For example, some of the top eCommerce podcasts drive nearly a third of traffic to Shopify websites. In addition to its site, Shopify is home to 2.3 million active stores and drives listeners to Shopify Masters, its own podcast. As eCommerce soared in popularity over the past two years, so has traffic to podcast websites. So, which podcasts are winning, and what makes them different? Traffic and engagement metrics for some of our winners (via Digital Research Intelligence) Top 4 eCommerce podcast picks for retailers and brands 1.

Mywifequitherjob.com received an average of 216,800 monthly visits this year — triple that of eCommerceFuel, which ranks second. It’s one of the top sites capturing traffic for the keyword “eCommerce,” which generated 2.8% of visits. Traffic for the keyword “eCommerce,” via Digital Research Intelligence Host Steve Chou started the MyWifeQuitHerJob podcast after his wife quit her job to spend more time with their two kids.
