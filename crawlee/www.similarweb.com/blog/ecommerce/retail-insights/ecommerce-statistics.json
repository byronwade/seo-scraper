But with so many options online, what’s influencing shopping behavior in 2022?

A survey found that automated welcome emails sent by eCommerce companies had a conversion rate of 51.9%. Shopping cart eCommerce statistics Shopping cart abandonment refers to customers adding items to their shopping cart, but exiting the site before purchasing.

By 2025, sales through social media are expected to reach $79.6 billion. Social media surge Social media has become an incredibly powerful marketing tool, so it’s no surprise that business executives are increasingly prioritizing it in their eCommerce efforts. Many brands have made it a priority to partner with influencers and foster a brand community online. Many of us spend a huge amount of our time scrolling through social media apps.
