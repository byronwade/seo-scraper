The term began in Philadelphia in the 1960s referencing the day between Thanksgiving (Thursday) and the annual Army-Navy football game (Saturday). The police nicknamed it “Black Friday” because officers had to work long hours while dealing with horrible traffic and crowds. Since local retailers wanted to use those crowds to increase profits businesses reclaimed the name, saying that the day was when stores’ finances went from red ink to black. The reclaimed term stuck and spread first across America, and now thanks to the globalized economy, to worldwide retailers. Black Friday vs. Cyber Monday Cyber Monday takes place on Monday immediately following Black Friday. With retailers offering exclusive online discounts, it acts essentially as Black Friday’s eCommerce counterpart. It’s also fair to say it’s just about the only Monday in the year anyone looks forward to! 2020 Cyber Monday – accounted for the biggest online shopping day in U.S. history, bringing in an astounding $10.7 billion. However, in 2021, shoppers spent about $100 million less than that. While Black Friday certainly has a richer history, Cyber Monday is becoming the more hotly-anticipated event. Here are three key stats to help you best leverage the day: According to Salescycle.com, in 2021, the peak time for mobile online Cyber Monday traffic was 21:00, while desktop traffic peaked at 11:00.
