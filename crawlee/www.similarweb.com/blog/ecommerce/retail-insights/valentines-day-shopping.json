February 10, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Nobody loves Valentine’s Day more than the online retailers who benefit from the holiday’s gift-giving tradition. And since the days of actually going to a brick-and-mortar store to stock up on sweets for your sweetie (or yourself) are so easily replaced with a few clicks, consumers are increasingly scouring the internet to look for a perfect gift for that special someone. To help you plan your eCommerce strategy for consumer-focused holidays in the future, we used Similarweb Shopper Intelligence to determine the top Valentine’s gifts on Amazon. We focused on categories that melt our hearts: jewelry, flowers, chocolates, electronics, and beauty and personal care. We also got up close and personal with the leading brands in each category to give you a peek at which companies in particular have been struck by Cupid’s arrow. Ready to fall in love? Jewelry Diamonds really are everyone’s best friend and consumer demand suggests jewelry will, as usual, be a top gift for Valentine’s Day this year. Amazon’s Women’s Jewelry category saw 6.9 million units sold and $195.3 million in revenue in January 2022, a 13% and 29% increase respectively from the year before. Now that’s putting a price on love! Unlike other sales performance metrics, there was a dip of 25% in jewelry product views. This suggests that shoppers came to Amazon already with the intent of purchasing an item. Our top picks for your Valentine’s Day shopping list are Pavoi’s gold open hoop earrings or a 14K gold plated M MOOHAM layering necklace. These two products were two of the most purchased of the category in January 2021, with 18,600 and 17,300 units sold. If you’re looking to splurge, grab some Amazon Collection white gold diamond earrings while you still can. Some other companies taking advantage of the season of love on Amazon include Joycuff, Hicarer, and Alex and Ani – all top brands in the category with high revenue, product views, and units sold. Earrings and rings are the most searched products on Amazon in this category with 173,900 and 142,800 clicks in January 2022. Flowers Flowers are the quintessential Valentine’s Day gift. Compared to Valentine’s Day shopping patterns in the past, the sales performance of Amazon’s Fresh Flowers and Live Indoor Plants category exceeded expectations. Units sold are up 43%, with revenue increasing an impressive 84%. What plants are consumers pining over this year? Check out these top Amazon product listings – see any similarities in listing features (price point, reviews, quantity, etc.)? Brussel’s Live Fukien Tea Indoor Bonsai Tree Costa Farms Money Tree Pachira Benchmark Bouquets Flowering Fields, With Vase If you’re only in the business of selling fresh flowers online, roses still reign as the most popular post on Valentine’s Day. Top brands include Benchmark Bouquets and Floral. Our data shows that consumers are also opting for plants with longer longevity this year. Wilting flowers don’t really paint that everlasting picture. Adding to consumers’ growing interest in sustainability and eco-friendly products, search volume for dried flowers on Amazon grew 36% in January 2022 compared to the month before, with 93.2% of clicks coming organically. Chocolate Cue the romance with the sweetest sentiment of all: chocolate. Shopper behavior indicates that GODIVA Chocolatier, Dove, and Lindt will be the top three chocolatiers on Valentine’s Day, each selling over 5,000 units in January 2022 with combined revenue of approximately $450K. Wine Country Gift Baskets is another fan favorite. It’s number one product is a Ghirardelli Chocolate Gift Tower – scrumptious and stately! In January 2022, this product brought in $50,000 in revenue – impressive! Compared to last year, chocolate and candy gifts earned 14% more revenue but saw units sold and product views drop slightly. Electronics But don’t forget the power of communication – electronically, that is. It’s 2022 and the gift your significant other could be eyeing the most isn’t a bouquet of flowers or a sweet surprise, but the next must-have gadget in consumer electronics. We focused on Amazon’s Wearable Technology category to hone in on smaller, more personal items and found that Apple, Samsung, and Fitbit are the winning brands for Valentine’s Day shoppers in the market for a smartwatch. Take a look at brand performance in January 2022: Compared to years in the past, we can see that shoppers are less interested in wearable technology as opposed to some of the other top Valentine’s Day gifts on our list. However, the industry is still putting up strong revenue numbers each month. Beauty and personal care The greatest love story of all? The one you have with yourself. So if you’re looking to indulge your vanity this V-Day, you’re not the only one. Revenue is on the rise for beauty brands as consumers increasingly turn to online marketplaces to buy their favorite products. Amazon’s Beauty and Personal Care category earned $200 million more in January 2022 compared to the year before, but product views dropped 18%. Consumers are more intentional in their beauty product purchases than in years past. Top Amazon keywords in this category for the month (and gifts we think your loved ones would appreciate) include a Waterpik, electric toothbrush, makeup bag, or makeup organizer. Due to explosive coverage on TikTok, our top pick for anyone looking to splurge this year is the Dyson Airwrap for effortless hair every time. Some other best-selling hair care products to watch include: REVLON One-Step Volumizer Original 1.0 Hair Dryer and Hot Air Brush, Black Crave Naturals Glide Thru Detangling Brush for Adults Hair Shampoo Brush, HEETA Scalp Care Hair Brush If you’re hoping to give your loved one a new perfume, look no further than some of Amazon’s best-selling scents by Victoria’s Secret, Versace, and Bath & Body Works. Give some love to your eCommerce strategy For any business with an online presence, understanding consumer behavior is a must that’s only elevated during gift-giving holidays. With the right data, you’ll not only get big picture data of products across Amazon, but also specifics such as competitor performance, audience demographics, and keyword trends.
