June 24, 2021 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Amazon Prime Day, among the biggest shopping holidays of the year, kicked off just days ago. Using Prime Day data from Shopper Intelligence, our eCommerce intelligence tool for Amazon and online marketplaces, we provide highlights from Day 1. Prime Day 1 2021 vs. 2020: The big picture Despite more consumers returning to shopping in-store as we recover from the pandemic, the Day 1 performance of the virtual event exceeded last year (Oct. 12, 2020). Product views, units sold, and revenue across categories increased by at least 20%. At +23.6%, revenue increased the most. The rise in spending may be attributed to higher consumer confidence levels now vs. last Prime Day during the fall. Consumer confidence surged 19.3 points to 109.7 this spring, one of the largest jumps on record. Additionally, stimulus checks, tax refunds, and lower unemployment levels may have put more spending money in consumers’ pockets. Top Prime Day categories Historically, electronic brands offer some of the deepest discounts on Prime Day, so, in-the-know consumers are primed to spend on new gadgets. Fittingly, electronics generated more revenue than any other category on Day Electronics brands that pull in the most revenue So which brands powered ahead of the competition? Samsung Electronics, Samsung, Acer, Sony, and Apple took in the most revenue on Day 1. Electronics-related keyword searches drove their success and reflected booming consumer demand. More than half of the top 10 keywords drove traffic to the Electronics or Amazon Device categories, highlighting consumers actively searching for these products. “Laptop” was the top keyword across Amazon. Acer took 27% of the brand share for the term, the most among competitors’ brands, and ranked fifth among top electronics brands. “Monitor,” the fifth most popular keyword ranked by unique users, helped drive traffic to Samsung, which generated the most (24%) brand share for the term. Samsung ranked second among the top electronics brands. Consumers’ computer-related interest helped drive other brands like Lenovo and HP up the list to rank among the top 10. Winning electronics products The winners – Firestick and Echo Dot The voice-controlled smart speaker Echo Dot, Amazon’s best-selling product in Prime Day 2020, fell behind the Fire TV Stick this year. However, it still dominated the electronics category – more than half of top-selling products were Echo-dot related. Last year, Echo Dot (3rd Generation) – A smart speaker with Alexa (Charcoal color), placed first. This year, the 4th Generation smart speaker with Alexa, placed second. Though a few third-generation Echos also made the rankings, the year-over-year (YoY) trends show that consumers are replacing Echos with newer models. A regular price under $30, combined with Prime Day discounts, makes upgrading fairly affordable. Other (typically) top-performing brands The Blink smart security mini camera ranked among the top 10 electronics products for Prime Day 1, 2021, and also ranked in the top 10 (of all products) last year. Apple’s AirPods ranked among the top 10 best-selling products during Prime Day 2020 (really, “Days”). For the first day of Prime Day this year, it did not even rank among the top 10 in the electronics category. Notably, “AirPods” ranked among the top 10 most searched keywords across all Amazon categories on Day 1 suggesting serious consumer interest in the product. The product may bring in more revenue on Prime Day 2 after consumers finish browsing (Day 1) and start buying the next day.
