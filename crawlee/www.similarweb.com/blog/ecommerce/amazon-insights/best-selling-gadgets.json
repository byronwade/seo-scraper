June 15, 2021 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Gadgets are top of mind both as gifts for Dad and as potential Amazon Prime Day purchases, which has historically had some of the best deals on electronics. In this article, we’ll use Shopper Intelligence, our eCommerce intelligence tool to analyze the top 10 best-selling gadgets on Amazon and the trends propelling their success. Here’s a preview of the rankings and some trends we noticed for top-selling gadgets: 1. Waterproof binoculars score first, despite reviews With nearly 300,000 units sold, Stipend’s waterproof binoculars took first place among Amazon’s top-selling electronics in May 2021. Ironically, the product also has the least number of reviews (717) and the lowest product rating (4.3) among all products in our top 10 list. The top 10 products average 206,000 reviews and 4.7-star ratings. Why first place? Low prices: It seems like Stilend’s low prices help consumers forgive its review and rating metrics. Shopper Intelligence Amazon’s on-site search data shows that Stilend gets nearly 95% of search clicks for “binoculars” and the brand averages a $43.45 unit price – more than $200 less than competitor brands, averaging $269.04. Exploding seasonal demand: Warm weather also drives Stilend’s binoculars’ popularity. We see that the brands’ performance, including units sold, revenue, product views, and conversion rates (CVRs) jumps from April to May as the weather gets warmer. With this seasonal consumer demand, we expect Stilend products to be much more popular gifts for Father’s Day than holidays like Christmas, in the colder months. 2. Samsung’s memory card scores second in the ideal 128GB size SAMSUNG: EVO Select 128GB Memory card with adapter is the second best-selling product on our list. Offering more space on your devices and a higher speed, this item is soaring in popularity. Compatible with tablets, laptops, action cameras, DSLRs, drones, smartphones, and other devices, the versatile memory card is attractive to a wide range of consumers. In ninth place, Sandisk’s 128GB memory card also makes our top 10 list. These rankings show that consumers crave a 128GB memory card size. Sandisk’s 200GB memory card, one size up from 128GB rounds out the top 10 products. Consumers cannot get this size memory card if they want to upsize from 128GB and remain loyal to Samsung’s brand. Instead, Samsung offers a memory card that is more than 25% larger than Sandisk’s option – 256GB. No memory cards of this size make our top 10 list. These trends indicate that consumers prefer to take “baby steps” when purchasing products like memory cards and brands should offer products with incremental levels of storage. 3. Apple products dominate the list With 1.75 million products sold in May, Apple is the top Amazon electronics brand. It makes four out of 10 best-selling gadgets on our top 10 list, more than any other. Of these, airpod products are the most popular. Apple Airpods Pro ranked third and Apple Airpods with charging case, ranked sixth. Both products’ price points, $197 and $132 respectively, are more than double the category average. However, consumers appear willing to spend more due to strong loyalty to the Apple brand. In May, more than 60% of Apple’s search clicks were for branded terms. Comparatively, 30% of Samsung searches were branded clicks. Apple products also had the second-highest number of product views in its category in May (behind ASUS). Apple products’ elevated price point, loyal following, and a high number of product views indicate that shoppers will be eager to purchase Apple products once Prime Day discounts kick in. Those on a budget may be more likely to spring for its Apple Earpods with lightning connector, its eighth-ranked product (approximately $15.00) rather than its more popular, costlier items. Conclusion Memory cards and AirPods are just a sample of best-selling gadgets on Amazon in May, many of which are contenders for Father’s Day gifts, Amazon Prime Day purchases, or both.
