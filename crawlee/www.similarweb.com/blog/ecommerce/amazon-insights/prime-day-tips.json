June 22, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Set to kick off July 12, Amazon Prime Day for 2022 is just around the corner. Last year’s revenue – a whopping $6.8 billion – broke records, and this year may be the same. Using Shopper Intelligence, our Amazon insights tool, we’ve gathered our top tips for Amazon Prime Day so you can cash in on the anticipated record-breaking revenue. Our Prime Day tips Here are our top six tips to prepare for Amazon Prime Day: 1. Optimize your product listings now Taking action now to optimize your Amazon product listings is key to finetuning your Amazon Prime Day marketing strategy. This may seem like a lot of work in the countdown to Prime Day, but we have good news for you: the benefits of your optimizations won’t expire anytime soon after the two-day event. A lot of the tips we’re advertising are best practices, meaning you don’t need to change your listings back after Prime Day. Want to increase your chances of appearing in the top results? Follow some basic Amazon SEO principles. Understanding and tailoring your content to match Amazon’s algorithms will mean you optimize your chances of ranking year-long, not just on Prime Day. 2. Leverage data to outsell your competitors To help improve your listings, use competitor analysis to further optimize your product sales and outrun your competitors on Amazon. For instance, you can use Shopper Intelligence to identify the key players in your market that are selling alternative products to yours. Once you spot these players, dive deeper into why they’re performing well.

You can start by tracking their keywords, reading their product reviews, and comparing their images with yours. 3. #Shoutout your Prime Day deals Top tip from us: don’t underestimate the power social media has on Amazon sales. Consumers who discover your brand on Amazon will look to social media to validate your business. So whether you’ve established an active presence online already or not, stay consistent and start generating buzz for your Prime Day deals. Not convinced yet? The proof is in the numbers: The extremely popular #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt boasts 14.4 billion views on the platform #AmazonFinds brought in 21.9 billion views on TikTok and has 1.7 million mentions on Instagram #amazondeals has 1.4 million mentions on Instagram From creating your own marketing content, utilizing influencers, or promoting customer reviews online, take advantage of social media in the lead-up to and on Prime Day itself. 4. Make sure pricing is competitive Optimizing your pricing strategy in advance may help you generate more sales in the long run. Knowing the prices of what sold well during previous Prime Day events on category and subcategory levels can help you decide what to discount, by how much, and if it’s worth the investment. Even if your product has the best ratings, consumers purely driven by deals may not buy it if the price isn’t right. 5. Consider Amazon paid advertising With browsing up, Prime Day is an opportune day to pay for eyeballs, clicks, and sales. If you can, test campaigns with all advertising options Amazon has available. For example, use Amazon PPC to bid for keywords that can amplify your product views and sales. If you’ve turned off some successful ads due to budget constraints, now could be the time to turn them back on. 6. Leave a lasting impression on your customers Prime Day is the optimal opportunity to raise your brand awareness and increase your sales. So why not take advantage of the exposure Prime Day offers you by impressing your customers with branded product inserts? This can be anything from discounts for future purchases, clearly stated customer service information, or throwing in a small freebie. Even a simple thank you card can go a long way and leave an impression on your customers. Plus, this could even increase your product reviews. Next steps: get the most out of Prime Day Now that you’re ready to optimize your sales, start outselling your competitors and wowing your customers this Prime Day.
