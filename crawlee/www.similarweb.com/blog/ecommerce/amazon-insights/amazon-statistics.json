June 14, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic When I shop for anything online, the first place I check is Amazon. It’s easy, offers fast shipping, and my credit card and home address are already saved. In a world where convenience is key, it’s the obvious choice. And I’m not alone. Amazon revolutionized the world of eCommerce years ago, but the pandemic is where it really shined. The marketplace took on the challenges of COVID-19 and capitalized on consumers’ needs for buying everything, and we mean everything online. Between groceries, home goods, health supplements, electronics, and even furniture. There really isn’t anything you can’t find on Amazon anymore. It makes sense that last year nearly 50% of all eCommerce purchases in the U.S. happened through Amazon. Using data from Similarweb Shopper Intelligence and Research Intelligence, we’re diving into 87 key Amazon statistics you need to know to make sure that you get the most of your marketplace listings and set yourself up for success in the eCommerce world. The basic Amazon statistics everyone should know Amazon’s yearly revenue in 2021 was $469.8 billion. So, how much does amazon make a day? per minute? per second? That’s $39.2 billion per month, roughly $9.1 billion a week, $1.3 billion per day, $54.2 million per hour, $903,300 per min, and $15,100 per second. Before we get into some of the nitty-gritty Amazon stats, let’s take a look at some key website metrics, and just how much the marketplace stands out from the competition. Since Amazon operates across different domains determined by country, we’re focusing solely on Amazon U.S. (amazon.com). Amazon website traffic Q1 2022: 5.6 billion visits to Amazon.com (U.S) on both desktop and mobile web. 2021: 24.2 billion visits to amazon.com This year, monthly visits have hovered around 1.2 billion in the U.S. on desktop only, a slight drop compared to the year before (1.3 billion) but this is to be expected given the return of in-person shopping and new consumer behavior. Website traffic is still steady, suggesting that Amazon has converted consumers who once shopped for certain goods unavailable in-store during the pandemic (groceries, home goods, pharmaceuticals, etc) to digital natives. The following Amazon statistics are based on engagement data from May 2021-April 2022, desktop only. Total visits – There were 15.8 billion visits to Amazon’s desktop site between May 2021-April 2022. Bounce rate – The percentage of Amazon visitors who viewed only one page before leaving (or bouncing) the site stands at 22.0%. The average pages per visit for this time period are 11.6. The average session duration in the last year was 9 minutes and 32 seconds. Unique visitors – Average unique visitors (meaning the number of people using Amazon not duplicated between devices) from April 2021-April 2022 is 115.2 million. There were 15.3 billion page views on Amazon in the last year. Market share – Amazon earns 56.8% of traffic share compared to the top 100 marketplace websites in the U.S. (based on the last three months). Amazon’s top competitors in the U.S. are ebay.com, walmart.com, etsy.com, and target.com. Marketing channels – On desktop, direct is the most popular way to reach Amazon (61.6%), followed by organic search (20.9%), and referrals (5.4%). Desktop vs. mobile web split – 66.6% of web traffic comes from desktop, compared to 33.4% on mobile web. Some important Amazon business statistics include: More than 4,000 items are bought in a minute on Amazon, from 12 million different products offered There are over 300 million active users on Amazon. Amazon stats worldwide Because Amazon operates across different domains, it’s important to analyze performance in specific countries to really understand the scope of the marketplace giant. Below we break down some Amazon statistics in some of its target markets outside of the U.S. (Desktop only, May 2021-June 2022). U.K. – amazon.co.uk Total visits – 2.4 billion Average monthly visits – 200.2 million Unique visitors – 19.1 million Visit duration – 8 minutes 28 seconds Pages per visit – 10.3 Bounce rate – 24.4% Page views – 2.1 billion France – amazon.fr Total visits – 1.1 billion Average monthly visits – 94.8 million Unique visitors – 13.2 million Visit duration – 9 minutes 30 seconds Pages per visit – 12.1 Bounce rate – 23.3% Page views – 1.1 billion Germany – amazon.de Total visits – 2.6 billion Average monthly visits – 219.0 million Unique visitors – 20.4 million Visit duration – 9 minutes 08 seconds Pages per visit – 12.2 Bounce rate – 22.4% Page views – 2.7 billion Japan – amazon.co.jp Total visits – 4.0 billion Average monthly visits – 332.9 million Unique visitors – 24.4 million Visit duration – 9 minutes 08 seconds Pages per visit – 9.9 Bounce rate – 26.2% Page views – 3.3 billion Amazon product statistics Website traffic analytics reveals how many consumers are visiting Amazon’s website over time, but how many of those visitors convert into paying customers? Throughout 2021: Amazon sold 13.5 billion units This totaled $407.4 billion in revenue There were 127.1 billion product views Amazon’s conversion rate was 9.7% Amazon’s sales stats so far in 2022 Between January-May 2022, Amazon has: Sold 5.5 billion units Which totaled $180.4 billion in revenue And 49.6 billion product views With a conversion rate of 10.2% In comparison to the same time period in 2021, Amazon has sold 200M more units and generated $30.2B more in revenue. However, there were fewer product views overall between January-May 2022 compared to the year before, suggesting that users come to the website knowing what they want and don’t need to browse or that they are willing to pay more for products that may have previously cost less.
