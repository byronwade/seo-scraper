November 18, 2020 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Travel has been hit hard by COVID, but in some (outdoor) locations, people are flocking to boutique hotels, outdoor camping sites, and other natural settings to get some long-overdue relaxation time. In the infographic below, we highlight five of the top-growing destinations globally as of September 2020. ➤ Get the full infographic! 1) Krasnodar Krai, Sochi, Russia Krasnodar Krai sounds like a film location in the Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones, but, we promise, it’s 100% real. With its lush landscape, access to mountain and beach terrain, and mild, subtropical climate, this region was the perfect spot for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games. Most travelers book through online travel agencies (OTAs), which account for 91% of bookings in the area. However, vacation rental bookings quadrupled year-over-year (YoY) as more locals opened their homes to visitors to take advantage of the domestic tourism uptick. Top 5 hotels in Krasnodar Krai, Sochi Olympia Hotel Gorki Panorama Barkhatnye Sezony Russky Dom Resort Sportivny Kvartal AZIMUT Hotel FREESTYLE Rosa Khutor VALSET apartments by AZIMUT Rosa Khutor 2) Montana, U.S. Home to Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, and others, Montana became a hot spot this summer as US families and small groups of friends hunted for COVID-safe, remote, drivable destinations. Motels are the standard here and provide the best entrances to the park. Simultaneously, vacation rentals have a surprisingly low penetration of the market (they capture 4.2% of bookings, a measly amount compared to the 22.5% of the market share going to suppliers). Top 5 hotels in Montana Little River Motel Saint Regis Kelly Inn West Yellowstone Country Inn & Suites by Radisson, Kalispell, MT – Glacier Lodge Yellowstone Big Rock Inn Mini Golden Inns Motel 3) Utah, U.S. Similar to Montana, Utah boasts a bevy of national parks that made road-tripping easier than ever this summer. Most visitors choose to camp or stay in motels, much more budget-friendly offerings than the luxe resorts, like Amangiri, that populated Kardashian and other influencer Instagram feeds over the past few months. Suppliers and OTAs are the dominant force here again, as vacation rentals lost three percentage points (pps) of market share, YoY. Top 5 hotels in Utah Best Western PLUS Ruby’s Inn La Quinta by Wyndham at Zion Park/Springdale Goulding’s Lodge Best Western PLUS Bryce Canyon Grand Hotel Bryce View Lodge 4) Pahang, Malaysia Come for the views; stay for the food! Another international destination where OTAs own the market with 94% of all bookings, Pahang boasts beautiful mountainside accommodations with much more temperate weather than the tropical climate Malaysia is known for. From grabbing durians off their trees to local eateries and hotel offerings, you won’t go hungry here, and you’ll be able to walk it all off in the peaceful surroundings. Top 5 hotels in Pahang Copthorne Cameron Highlands Geo38 Premier Suites Genting Highlands Laman Pesona Resort & Spa Resorts World Genting – First World Hotel Grand Ion Delemen Hotel 5) Oregon, U.S. Although Oregon has been through some tough times lately, nothing is as beautiful as Rockaway Beach at sunset or as relaxing as a lazy Sunday afternoon float on the Deschutes River. Vacation rentals and suppliers have a healthy share of the market here – each landing around 20% of bookings, while OTAs own the other 60%. Like Montana, motels offer popular, budget-friendly options for those looking for a lowkey way to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Pacific Northwest. Top 5 hotels in Oregon Motel 6 Coos Bay Sunset Surf Motel Riverhouse on the Deschutes Surfside Resort Red Lion Inn & Suites Deschutes River – Bend Are you operating in the accommodations sector?
