Parentz Talk captured the #1 spot for News & Media in Similarweb’s annual Digital 100 ranking of the online businesses with the most impressive growth. The average monthly visits to parentztalk.com grew 2,679%, year-over-year, between 2022 and 2023. This finding is based on Similarweb’s Digital 100 report for the US, published today at similarweb.com/corp/digital-100/ with top 10 rankings for 10 industries: Apparel & Accessories, Automotive, Beauty & Cosmetics, Consumer Electronics, Food & Drinks, Home & Garden, News & Media, Personal Finance, Pet Care, and Travel & Tourism. Each of the winners was already operating a substantial online business in 2022, but significantly increased its reach in 2023. For News & Media, the Top 10 in are: Site YoY Traffic Growth Market Segment parentztalk.com 2679.20% Parenting advice blog themusicman.uk 950.70% UK based music blog resistthemainstream.com 758.30% Alternative media thedebrief.org 717.30% Tech and science livenewsof.com 684.60% Live stream news yourroyals.com 623.30% News and features about the UK royal family sfstandard.com 566.00% Bay Area news learnitwise.com 561.70% College news tuckercarlson.com 536.30% Alternative media denvergazette.com 535.70% Denver regional news These results suggest a few themes: Parenting blog traffic is boom and bust This was the second year in a row a parenting blog topped our News & Media list, showing how quickly parents can flock to a site they find useful – although that doesn’t necessarily mean they will keep coming back. The standout performance of Parentz Blog appears to have been driven by a strong mid-year surge in referrals from Facebook, which has since faded. Another parenting blog, Forever Mom, topped the list last year, with a traffic boom driven by strong referrals traffic – a boom it wasn’t able to match in 2023. Sources of traffic to ParentzBlog.com, US Visits to Forever-Mom.com, US The growth in traffic to Your Royals is also likely a temporary phenomenon, driven by the success of the Netflix show The Crown and the news surrounding the coronation of King Charles. Alternative media for Trumpists Former President and US candidate Donald J. Trump has been the loudest voice against “fake news,” which former Fox News host and current streaming entrepreneur Tucker Carlson amplified. Carlson’s tuckercarlson.com and the resistthemedia.com are among the sites benefitting from the audience for media that contradicts mainstream media narratives. The appetite for local news Even as newspapers struggle, some sites offering local news are seeing strong growth. Traffic to The San Francisco Standard was up 566%, while traffic to The Denver Gazette rose 536%. The Denver Gazette also placed on last year’s Digital 100 list.

Digital 100 Methodology Building on Similarweb’s general methodology for creating a comprehensive model of the digital world, the Digital 100 project reveals the fastest growing web domains from pre-defined industry categories. Growth is measured as a percentage increase in average monthly traffic volume from 2022 to 2023. To qualify for inclusion, each domain had to meet a minimum average monthly traffic in both years. For the US, the minimum was 100,000 monthly visits in 2023 and 50,000 in 2022. A lower threshold was used for specific categories in other countries. Similarweb analysts then manually filtered the results to discover the most meaningful examples of digital business growth.
