February 6, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Survey reveals who will be watching, which apps they’ll be using during the game, and which team fans expect to win The celebrity power couple of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift is drawing viewers to the Super Bowl, with nearly 20% of respondents citing their relationship as a key reason for tuning in. An additional 23% see it as an added layer of interest, boosting viewership potential to 42% among those intrigued by both the game and the couple’s dynamic. That’s the feedback from the Similarweb Market Research Panel, an enrolled panel of smartphone users who provide survey-based input to supplement our study of user behavior across the web and apps. More than 1,000 representative US panelists were surveyed between Friday February 2nd and Monday 5th February. Love story can’t buy a trophy: Fans favor 49ers over Kelce’s Chiefs Despite the star power of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, the 49ers are the fans’ favorite. With 39% of votes, they edged out the Chiefs (35%), suggesting Kelce’s celebrity connection couldn’t sway Super Bowl predictions. It’s a family affair: Nearly 70% will be watching at home While not everyone is a die-hard football fan, the Super Bowl offers something for everyone. Even with 11% opting out of the game itself, 44% of those who choose to tune in will do so alongside family with another 25% still watching at home but planning to do so alone. This suggests that the broader appeal of the Super Bowl lies beyond just the sporting aspect. The commercials, halftime show, and the overall festive atmosphere likely contribute to its popularity as a family event. Sharing is caring: Preferred food choices point to those that allow for all to join in Forget fancy plates and gourmet spreads, Super Bowl Sunday is all about sharing and savoring the moment with loved ones. And what better way to do that than with classic game-day food? This year, fans are prioritizing dishes that encourage togetherness, with Chips and Wings reigning supreme as the ultimate crowd-pleasers (56% and 55% respectively). No surprise there! Pizza joins the party at 50%, solidifying its place as a Super Bowl staple. Looking for a lighter bite? Nachos snag a respectable 34% of viewer interest, offering a shareable, customizable option for those avoiding full plates. Sweet tooths don’t miss out either, with Candy making an appearance on 23% of snack lists. Healthier options take a backseat this year, with only 12% opting for conscious choices. But hey, it’s Super Bowl Sunday, and sometimes indulging is part of the fun! Homemade takes the field: the Super Bowl is more than the game as the kitchen battles for the MVP This Super Bowl Sunday, forget store-bought frozen wings – consumers are embracing their inner chefs and whipping up homemade feasts! Except for Pizza and Health-conscious options, the majority plan to make their snacks, driven by the desire to celebrate with loved ones and showcase their culinary skills. The Super Bowl is For The Bold: Doritos will be advertising to an aligned audience A whopping two-thirds of Chips snackers plan to munch on their brand during the game, placing them firmly in the end zone with a commanding lead before kickoff. But the competition will be as fierce as the game itself. Both Frito-Lay and Pringles are preparing their offensive plays, launching commercials during the big game in hopes of stealing some hungry consumers away from Doritos. This year’s Super Bowl promises to be a high-stakes chip showdown, with each contender vying for supremacy in the snack aisle. All bets are on: Nearly 20% of watchers plan to use Sports Betting apps during the game Get ready for more than just touchdowns and halftime shows this Super Bowl Sunday! Nearly 20% of viewers are planning to double down on the excitement with sports betting apps, testing their football knowledge and maybe, just maybe, outsmarting the odds. Talk about high stakes! But the action doesn’t stop there. 61% will be social media warriors, cheering, sharing, and reveling in the fan community, especially those cozying up at home. Hungry for more than just the game? 27% are calling in the food delivery cavalry, ensuring their snack game is as on point as the quarterback’s throws. And let’s not forget the 17% of fantasy football fanatics, glued to their screens hoping for those game-changing points. Last year, DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM were the highest-ranking betting apps on iOS on Super Bowl Sunday. We’ll be watching to see if those rankings change this year.
