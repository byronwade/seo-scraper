December 20, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Temu launched in Europe during a highly opportune time. Rising inflation across the continent, fueled by global conflicts, drove consumers to seek out the lowest prices possible Temu capitalized on this trend by offering deeply discounted goods, quickly establishing itself as a major player in the European market. However, whether Temu can maintain its momentum in the long term remains uncertain. Disrupting the status quo Temu’s launch was a major success across Europe Commanding significant share in the opening months of its launch, Temu’s traffic share is showing signs of stabilizing in some markets. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the coming months – if investment into customer acquisition continues or the focus switches to retention. However, the Chinese player continues to gain momentum in France and Italy, where Temu grabbed close to an 8% market share of the top 10 multi-category retailers.

Engagement also remains stable, averaging around 2.4 sessions per user each month. Temu – Monthly Active Users & Sessions Per User – UK Android Devices, Apr 23 – Nov 23 Temu – Monthly App Downloads & Install Penetration – UK Android Devices, Apr 23 – Nov 23 Temu’s brand strength is still weaker than that of eBay and Amazon However, Temu sees more direct visits than established local players Currys and John Lewis, indicating a higher proportion of returning users Temu vs. Competitors* – Brand Strength – UK Desktop & Mobile Web, Sep 23 – Nov 23 *eBay & Amazon removed Temu appeals to an older, female, cost-conscious consumer While its user base skews both older and more female than app users within the Shopping category, Temu’s top overlapping apps are competitors in the ultra-low-cost landscape. Shein, AliExpress and Wish all offer ultra-low-cost at the expense of longer delivery times while there are also bargains to be had on eBay. Temu vs. Shopping App Category – Demographics – UK Android Devices, Oct 23 Top Overlap Apps of Temu Users – Shopping – UK Android Devices, Apr 23 – Oct 23 Temu’s conversion rate is better than their closest low-cost rivals Managing a better conversion rate than the majority of it’s rivals – notably higher than AliExpress & Wish – Temu can be proud of how it entices consumers to make a first purchase on site. They are only surpassed by established players like local retailer Argos and those with global recognition, eBay and Amazon. Temu vs. Top Competitors – Conversion Rate & Converted Visits – UK Desktop, Aug 23 – Oct 23 But, Temu has yet to acquire its own unique customer base Temu has not yet developed a loyal base with a large proportion of visitors also visiting the likes of Argos and eBay. Yet the big players must still be aware of the threat that Temu poses with over 1 in 10 visitors to the top 3 retailers also visiting Temu – given the massive scale they have managed to acquire in such a short period, this proportion is only likely to increase as consumer awareness of Temu as a brand increases. Temu vs. Top Competitors – Audience Overlap – UK Desktop, Sep 23 – Nov 23 What is Temu’s strategy? One exceptional aspect of Temu’s strategy is its Next Generation Manufacturing model. NGM uses technology and timely consumer insights to optimize manufacturing processes. They also incorporate gamification elements into their platform. By introducing games into its app experience, Temu is able to offer free items and discounts to its users as a reward for increased engagement. Influencer collaboration is also a key part of their business expansion. Temu offers influencers a direct route to sign up and promote its hauls, and in return receive Temu credit to help build their following. A lot of emphasis is placed on customer acquisition Compared with its top competitors, a much larger proportion of web traffic comes via both Paid Search and Social as Temu looks to invest large sums of money into customer acquisition.
