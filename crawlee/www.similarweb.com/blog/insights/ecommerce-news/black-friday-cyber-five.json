Amazon gained as traffic dropped to other ecommerce players Similarweb’s traffic data to the top 716 ecommerce players on Black Friday shows a dampening in US consumer demand, as measured by traffic. On Black Friday, it seems that consumers prioritized travel (mainly transportation) over other large ticket items such as Home Furnishing or Luxury. As an ecommerce event, Black Friday really extends from Thanksgiving (celebrated on Thursday Nov. 23 in the US) to Cyber Monday – sometimes referred to as the “Cyber 5” days of peak online shopping. This report focuses on the first two days for which we can share digital performance data, with updates to follow as the full picture comes into focus. Top sectors in YoY Traffic change on Black Friday US, Desktop & Mobile Web, November 24th 2023 vs November 25th 2022 Traffic to grocery sites was also up 5% on Black Friday, indicating that Black Friday shoppers may have leveraged discounts to stock their pantries. In fact, according to Similarweb’s Market Research Panel of 1,824 Survey respondents, 45% of consumers planning to buy groceries during Black Friday were doing so to stock up. Top US eCommerce sites on Black Friday, in visits with Year-over-Year change US, Desktop & Mobile Web, November 24th 2023 Many top retailers experienced sluggish growth or traffic, with consumer demand dampening: Amazon still managed to increase website traffic by over 2% YoY versus Black Friday last year, with mixed results across its key categories Fashion and apparel retailers overall experienced a larger decline: -16% for Macy’s, -18% for Kohls, -6% for Gap Despite growing unique visitors on Black Friday by 91%, Temu did not make it to the top 15 players in visits Top US Retailers in Unique Visitors on Black Friday, with YoY Change US, Desktop & Mobile Web, November 24th 2023 vs November 5th 2022 Amazon was more successful than last year in the first two days of Cyber 5, except in the Clothing, Shoes, and Jewelry category Amazon’s early Black Friday sales have surpassed expectations, with a surge in visits and impressive growth across several key categories. This year’s Black Friday saw a 6% year-on-year (YoY) increase in visits to the overall site on Thanksgiving, outpacing the growth on Black Friday itself (3% YoY). The peak in visits occurred around 10 pm on Thanksgiving, indicating that shoppers were eager to browse for deals after dinner. On Black Friday, the peak was reached around 3 pm. Top categories on Thanksgiving and Black Friday in Product views, by Year-on-Year change in visits US, Desktop, Mobile Web & Mobile App, November 23rd and 24th 2023 vs November While the Toys and Games category experienced a surge in product views (12% YoY on Thanksgiving), indicating a strong appetite for holiday gifting deals, the Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry category saw a decline in demand on both days. This trend aligns with the broader observation of slowing global demand for fashion. Beauty and Personal Care emerges as a top performer on Amazon The Beauty and Personal Care category was a standout performer, with visits up 15% on Thanksgiving and 21% on Black Friday compared to last year. This surge in interest was reflected in strong sales of beauty best-sellers, which were discounted by up to 60%. Moreover, some of the top products were TikTok favorites, such as COSRX or Mighty Patch. Apple Remains a Consumer’s Favorite Apple’s dominance in the consumer electronics space was once again evident on Black Friday. The iPad. Apple Watch, and Airpods made it into the top 10 most searched products on Amazon, demonstrating their enduring popularity among shoppers. No Barbie takeover in the Toys & Games category Despite the success of the Barbie movie, it did not translate to a boost in sales of Barbie dolls, with none of Mattel’s dolls reaching the top 10. In fact, the top-selling Barbie product on Black Friday was the Barbie Dreamhouse, which came in at number 15. Overall, consumers were willing to spend more on toys and games this year, with the average selling price for the top 10 best-sellers being $27.32, up from $23.42 in 2022.
