Elorea, a Korean fragrance brand that sells direct to consumers, captured the #1 spot for Beauty & Personal Care in Similarweb’s annual Digital 100 ranking of the online businesses with the most impressive growth. The average monthly visits to elorea.com increased more than 1,000%, year-over-year, between 2022 and 2023. This finding is based on Similarweb’s Digital 100 report for the US, published today at similarweb.com/corp/digital-100/ with top 10 rankings for 10 industries: Apparel & Accessories, Automotive, Beauty & Cosmetics, Consumer Electronics, Food & Drinks, Home & Garden, News & Media, Personal Finance, Pet Care, and Travel & Tourism. Each of the winners was already operating a substantial online business in 2022, but significantly increased its reach in 2023. For Beauty & Cosmetics, the Top 10 in are: Site YoY Traffic Growth Market Segment elorea.com 1156.30% Fragrance hismileteeth.com 539.00% Oral care withagency.com 401.30% Personalized skincare hellobubble.com 210.60% Scientific skincare lilacst.com 199.80% Lashes lush.com 192.60% Skincare mooncat.com 179.70% Nail care tripletraders.com 178.60% Oriental fragrance bluatlas.com 167.10% Skincare for men oakcha.com 152.00% Fragrance (dupes) These results suggest a few themes: Economy and luxury coexist While beauty consumers are pursuing cost savings strategies such as subscription models and dupes of famous brands, high end luxury brands that connect with the right audience also demonstrate success, with Elorea (+1,156% YoY) as the prime example. Consumers show a preference for direct-to-consumer sales by manufacturers, showing the importance of brand nurturing customer relationships. Nevertheless, fragrance dupes are here to stay nevertheless, with Oakcha growing significantly (+152% YoY). Personalization and subscriptions Skincare personalisation is reaching the US, as shown by Agency Skincare (withagency.com) in the #3 spot on our list (+401%). Using a subscription sales model, which we also see with lilacs.com, allows a brand to offer a combination of higher savings and a more intimate, personalized relationship. DTC male beauty brand Blu Atlas also offer a subscribe-save and bundle model, allowing recurring customers to save up to 30% on the asking price for a moisturizer. In addition to convenience, these offerings help consumers budget for their online purchases, while not having to compromise on the quality of the products purchased. We’ve noticed similar trends in other product categories, including automotive (mechanic.expert) and pet care (askaveterinarianonline.com) where consumers are looking for ongoing access to products and services for a predictable monthly price.

Today Similarweb also published rankings for the United Kingdom, France (in French and English), Germany (in German and English), India, Japan, Brazil, and Australia. Digital 100 Methodology Building on Similarweb’s general methodology for creating a comprehensive model of the digital world, the Digital 100 project reveals the fastest growing web domains from pre-defined industry categories. Growth is measured as a percentage increase in average monthly traffic volume from 2022 to 2023. To qualify for inclusion, each domain had to meet a minimum average monthly traffic in both years. For the US, the minimum was 100,000 monthly visits in 2023 and 50,000 in 2022. A lower threshold was used for specific categories in other countries. Similarweb analysts then manually filtered the results to discover the most meaningful examples of digital business growth.
