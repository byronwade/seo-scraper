Digital 100 Methodology Building on Similarweb’s general methodology for creating a comprehensive model of the digital world, the Digital 100 project reveals the fastest-growing web domains from pre-defined industry categories. Growth is measured as a percentage increase in average monthly traffic volume from 2022 to 2023. To qualify for inclusion, each domain had to meet a minimum average monthly traffic in both years. For the US, the minimum was 100,000 monthly visits in 2023 and 50,000 in 2022. A lower threshold was used for specific categories in other countries. Similarweb analysts then manually filtered the results to discover the most meaningful examples of digital business growth. by Inès Durand Inès provides market research insights in Retail, CPG, and Financial Services.
