Within the food & drink app category, Yelp’s ranking in the Android app store in the United States has ranged from 4th-26th and currently is ranked 18th. Yelp ranks in the top 100 in 84 separate countries, and in the top 500 in 100 countries. On Desktop and Mobile Web, Yelp has 139 million monthly visits, only slightly behind Tripadvisor.com web traffic, but well ahead of visits to OpenTable, The Real Yellow Pages (yellowpages.com), and CitySearch. Yelp rankings have worsened somewhat over time Yelp’s business model revolves around user-generated content on restaurants and local businesses, with the company largely generating revenues through advertising and other services, including restaurant reservations and restaurant wifi. A look at Yelp’s ranking in the Android app store in general, and under the food & drink category shows that the ranking has gotten somewhat worse over time. First, we took a look at its general ranking in the Android app store. The chart below looks at the date range of March 2022-March 2023, and you can see that Yelp’s overall app store rank fluctuated from a best of 167 in May 2022, to a worst of 727 in January 2023. As of March 2023, its overall ranking was 353. The food & drink category shows slight worsening over time. Looking at the date range of April 2021-March 2023, you can see that Yelp’s ranking in the app store under the food & drink category has ranged from a best of fourth place to a worst of 26th place over time. It’s currently sitting in 18th place in this category. You can see the changes over time below, with a higher number representing a worse ranking over time. Yelp’s ranking has been deteriorating over time within this category. Below, you can see a list of the top 25 companies in the United States in the food & drink category. Notably, there is a mix of food delivery and fast food restaurants on the list, with restaurant reviews/reservations only really made up by Yelp. So though they have lost share in this category over time, it’s largely due to the rise of mobile ordering at fast food restaurants, rather than them losing out in their own mix of business.
