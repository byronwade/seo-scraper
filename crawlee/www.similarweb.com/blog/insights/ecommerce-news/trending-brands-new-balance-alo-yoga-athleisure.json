September 12, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic This excerpt from Simlarweb’s global retail brand trends report highlights two outstanding examples The athleisure trend remains robust, with leading brands integrating athletic wear into everyday wardrobes. While the category may not be growing as fast as it once was in the wake of the Covid pandemic, some brands are still pushing the boundaries for the category as a whole and innovating to challenge the might of the biggest players. Two athleisure brands with outstanding performance are: New Balance: Now one of the big three, gaining ground on both Nike and Adidas, primarily through strategic collaborations, sponsorships, and exclusive drops. Alo Yoga: A key player to watch in the premium activewear market alongside Lululemon, driven by growth through celebrity endorsements, social media buzz, and creating a distinct brand experience. These findings below are excerpted from Shaping the Market 2024: The Brands Defining Retail Trends, a 50+ page Similarweb report exploring the brands that are growing at a time of consumer caution and economic uncertainty – and what those brands are doing to distinguish themselves from the competition. In addition to covering Athleisure, the report includes chapters on K-Beauty (Korean beauty brands), Quiet Luxury, and Pet Care. For each of the trending brands, the report provides detailed digital metrics for how each of them excels – for example, conversion rate and revenue growth – and a “how they did it” analysis of the components of their success. To identify trends, we looked at web visits and search volume for the first half of 2024, compared with the same period in 2023. Key takeaways Overall, traffic to athleisure brand websites was down -3.6% year-over-year (YoY). However, the decrease was not uniform worldwide, with increases of 5.1% in the UK and 4.9% in Germany. New Balance grew its web traffic 32.9% in the UK, 26.7% in Germany, and 14.6% in the US, although traffic was down -25.6% in France. In all of these countries, including France, search volume for the New Balance brand was up considerably: 68.9% in the UK, 32.3% in France, 13.1% in Germany, and 10.1% in the US. Alo Yoga grew its web traffic by 111.0% in the UK, and 70.6% in the US, 53.0% in France, and 16.0% in Germany. Search volume for the brand rose 72.4% in France, 41.5% in the US, 32.6% in the UK, and 6.1% in Germany. Cooling consumer demand, but with exceptions The global -3.6% YoY decline in traffic to athleisure brand websites reflects a general shift in consumer focus as a result of continued economic struggles, with consumers now having to prioritize expenditure and choosing to spend on things like travel over fashion. Traffic to athleisure websites from within the UK grew the most, and both of our featured brands—Alo and New Balance—saw increases in website traffic and consumer interest.
