The recognition is part of the Similarweb Digital Marketing Awards announced today. Similarweb’s Streamline Award is given annually to digital companies that effectively employed a resilient and efficient marketing strategy to achieve growth. This awards program recognizes success at using search marketing and other digital marketing techniques to drive website traffic, as judged by both Similarweb metrics and the reviews by our panel of digital marketing experts. Lululemon’s success in digital marketing is demonstrated by its creative tactics and willingness to prioritize business strategy over paid spend KPIs (like increasing the number of mobile users exposed to their DTC channel). This is why they are an excellent example for other consumer brands. Key takeaways In 2022, Lululemon achieved a 27% year-over-year (YoY) growth in total visits, surpassing some of its biggest competitors like Nike, Gymshark, and Fabletics. Email traffic rose 62% YoY Mobile traffic rose 50%+ YoY Lululemon demonstrated particular success in growing its mobile traffic audience by investing in paid search and a winning Black Friday email campaign.
