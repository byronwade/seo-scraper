Sol de Janeiro, Bose, Tesla, and Dusk were among the domains that stretched their gains across the peak ecommerce period. The black Friday ecommerce event really stretches from at least Thanksgiving Day in the US through Cyber Monday – known as the Cyber 5. The latest in our series of reports on what happened this year focuses on ecommerce retail and direct-to-consumer brands that grew the most, compared to the 5-day period last year. Key takeaways In the US, beauty brands Sol de Janeiro (soldejaneiro.com), Bose (bose.com), and Laura Geller (laurageller.com) more than doubled their traffic over the 5-day period, compared with last year. In the UK, sites that more than doubled their Cyber 5 traffic included home products retailer Dusk (dusk.com), Cadbury Gifts Direct (cadburygiftsdirect.co.uk), and Abercrombie & Fitch (abercrombie.com). Sephora (sephora.co.uk) did almost that well, with 95% year-over-year growth. Temu was the largest of the digital properties to rank in the top 10 for Cyber 5 growth in the US. Traffic to the temu.com website was up 58% year-over-year, and it achieved that growth on top of an already-impressive scale – nearly 20 million visits during the Cyber 5 period, compared with hundreds of thousands for the others on our list. In the UK, the retailer Debenhams (debenhams.com) had the combination of growth and scale, up 42% year-over-year to 2.7 million Cyber 5 visits.
