July 17, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Prime Day, Amazon’s annual sales event, has become a major fixture in the retail calendar since its inception in 2015. Traditionally held in July, but recently expanding with an October edition, this shopping extravaganza offers Prime members exclusive access to a vast array of deals across all categories. As the mid-year counterpart to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Prime Day has consistently grown in scope and impact, transforming the summer shopping landscape. In 2024, excitement for July’s Prime Day is palpable as consumers eagerly hunt for the best bargains on everything from electronics and home goods to fashion and beauty products. With Day 1 of Prime Day behind us, let’s dive into top best sellers that are captivating shoppers. These examples were identified by their Best Seller Rank (BSR), a metric provided by Amazon. We’ve added pricing data captured by the Similarweb Shopper Intelligence platform. Amazon Devices & Accessories: Blink Outdoor 4 – 3 camera system As security concerns continue rising, consumers increasingly purchase smart security cameras. Prior to Prime Day, the single-camera version of this product led the category’s BSR. However, consumers likely anticipated a more substantial discount to invest in the 3-camera system during the event. Notably, the 3-camera system saw a remarkable increase in its BSR, climbing to the third spot in its category on day one of Prime Day, despite not being in the top 100 the day before. The product was offered at $99.99 on the first day of Prime Day, 57% lower than the average price for the last 30 days. However, it seems the brand aimed to promote the product ahead of the event, as the same discount was available in the days leading up to Prime Day. Electronics: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) By now, we can count on Apple products making it to the top of bestsellers lists, and Prime Day is no exception. As we showed you in our previous blog post, searches for “apple headphones” were up 10.4%. While search clicks for “apple airpods” were slightly down, they are still among the most searched keywords in the electronics category. Although Apple is not part of Prime Day Deals this year, on day 1 of the event the product was offered at its lowest price we have seen recently, 17% lower than the average price for the last 30 days. The product jumped 7 spots in the category’s BSR to become number one on the first day of Prime Day. Although not as substantial as some of the other products we highlight here, it underscores Apple’s brand strength, as consumers continue to choose their products despite the smaller discounts. Beauty & Personal Care: LANEIGE Lip Glowy Balm K-Beauty brands have skyrocketed in popularity and Laneige is one of the best sellers among them. These brands are growing faster than the overall Beauty & Personal Care category on the platform. Laneige, regarded as a luxury brand, has seen a 108% YoY increase in units sold over the last 12 months, compared to the 26% growth of the Beauty & Personal Care category. The Lip Glowy Balm surged to number 3 in the category’s BSR on the first day of Prime Day, up from over 100 the previous day. Its price, on average, is nearly twice that of similar products in the Lip Balms & Moisturizers sub-category. Despite its cult-favorite status, this could explain why consumers opt to wait until Prime Day to make their purchases. Home & Kitchen: BISSELL Little Green Multi-Purpose Portable Carpet and Upholstery Cleaner Bissell’s Little Green Cleaner has become a TikTok sensation, with millions of views across hundreds of videos. The product offers several features that have contributed to its popularity including portability, powerful suction (especially appealing for pet owners), and specialty tools for rinsing and stain removal. With a price reduction of more than $40 in addition to its massive popularity, it’s no surprise that the Little Green surged to the second spot in the category’s BSR, up from beyond 100 the previous day. This product was also among last year’s July Prime Day best sellers, possibly anticipating consumer expectations for a price drop. Stay tuned for our complete Prime Day wrap-up to see if it maintains its BSR position. Health & Household: Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 5300 As seen in previous years, “electric toothbrushes” consistently rank among the most searched products during Prime Day. While we didn’t see many major discounts for this product in the last year, this year saw some early Prime Deals offering price drops about a week before the event. The Philips Sonicare 5300 offered a nearly 50% drop in price on day one which has seemingly significantly impacted its BSR, jumping to 9th spot in the Health & Household category from beyond 100 the previous day. It stands out as one of the priciest products among the top 10 BSR in this category. In contrast, the other dental care products in the top 10 include whitening strips, while half are everyday household items such as batteries and garbage bags. This underscores the significance of the sonic toothbrush’s rapid ascent to the 9th spot following its substantial price drop.
