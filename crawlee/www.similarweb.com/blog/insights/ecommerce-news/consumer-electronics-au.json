September 19, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Over the past 12 months, Australian consumers have endured 12 interest rate rises. Due to the lag in how these increases filter through to homeowners, it’s only in the past two or three months we’ve started to really feel their impact – both for homeowners and for renters having their rents increased to cover higher mortgage repayments. That in itself is enough to put a dampener on consumer spending, but with inflation at record-high levels (which is the catalyst for the rate hikes), we wanted to explore what the impact has been on Australian eCommerce traffic. Over the coming days, we’ll unpack the impact on several Australian eCommerce sectors. Last week, we unstitched Fashion and Apparel, and in today’s installment, we’ll decode Australia’s online Consumer Electronics sector. Key takeaways Traffic to Australia’s top Consumer Electronics websites declined more than 10% YoY in the first six months of this year. JB Hi-Fi dominates the sector, but all major players saw significant traffic declines. As economic pressures build, Australians are increasingly interested in refurbished electronics. Home office-related searches are MIA as people reclaim their homes for leisure. JB Hi-Fi is in a league of its own Australia’s Consumer Electronics market is absolutely dominated by JB-Hi-FI, with more than 21% of the entire category’s market share. Its closest competitor, Apple, has a 13.33% market share. The sector’s overall decline is evident in the performance of the category leaders who, with the exception of Bing Lee, experienced YoY traffic declines of between 3 and 38% (but Bing Lee only narrowly avoided joining the rest of the cohort with an increase of just 1%). JB HiFi dominates the category, while Reebelo, specializing in refurbished electronics, posts a remarkable 67% growth Category Leaders H1 23 Traffic Share % H1 23 Avg.
