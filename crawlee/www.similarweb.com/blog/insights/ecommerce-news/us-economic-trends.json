May 8, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Over the past few years, the US financial services sector has been on a tumultuous journey. Inflation, interest rates, and a cost-of-living crisis have changed how people spend, possibly forever. Consumers have grown used to tightening their belts and shifted to a much more value-driven mindset, one where every single transaction counts. They’ve also begun to expect enhanced customer experiences powered by technologies like AI. So, how can businesses keep up with evolving consumer needs and expectations in such a constantly shifting financial landscape?

Using Similarweb Market Research Intelligence, we gathered the very latest data on consumer trends and economic shifts having the biggest impact on the financial landscape in 2024. With these key insights, you’ll have the information you need to stay one step ahead. Be the first to act on emerging trends (hello, competitive advantage), anticipate product demand, and understand your target audience on a whole new level. Here are some of the key themes we unearthed in our report: A quest for financial stability While credit cards will never truly go out of style, they’re not the focus for consumers at the moment. Instead, people are seeking out tools that will help them gain more financial stability. It’s high-interest savings, debt management, credit score improvement, and short-term loans that are ticking boxes in 2024. Here’s some of the data: US credit card searches may have increased by 8% YoY with 58 million searches, but it’s very specific credit card types that are fueling this growth – like reward credit cards that allow consumers to earn points or cashback But, demand for travel reward cards decelerated, possibly due to the lure of better rewards. The younger generation are most interested in travel rewards, with 58% of American Express users in the 18-35 age group Consumers are also prioritizing local travel to help control costs. Interest in local experiences and destinations was on the up: ground transportation and tourist attractions grew by 12% and 13% respectively Mortgages are back After a challenging few years for aspiring home buyers, mortgages are slowly getting back on track High interest rates have reshaped standards, however, with consumers now looking for the most affordable route to home ownership. A glimpse into the data on mortgages in 2024: There was a 6% increase in traffic to the Real Estate industry between January and February 2024, even though the Federal Reserve rate hasn’t budged from its plateau at 5.33% The popularity of FHA loans is on the rise due to lower downpayment requirements and wider credit acceptance, which is crucial for aspiring homebuyers Chase Bank has the best conversion rate thanks to its superior pre-approval process that qualifies potential customers before applying and commits to matching or beating the lowest rate on offer (as well as offering cash-based incentives): AI is not just a trend, but the future It looks like AI is a sure way to increase your market share Rocket Mortgage is the AI pioneer of the financial services industry.
