December 7, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic As Lululemon prepares to report third-quarter earnings on December 8, its ability to keep stretching its digital audience is looking good and bodes well for the holiday season. Key takeaways For the quarter that ended in October, desktop and mobile web visits were up 41% year-over-year, and Similarweb’s preliminary estimate for November is that traffic was also up 41% for that month. Lululemon fans aren’t just browsing but buying: checkout page visits were up between 29% and 38% each month of the quarter and another 34% in November. Traffic stretching higher A big Black Friday November was a strong month for Lululemon overall, but with a particularly great Black Friday, November 25th – nearly 2.5 million visits that day alone. Lululemon showed generally strong online traffic growth throughout the quarter. Checking out Getting traffic to an online store is important, but motivating consumers to visit the digital checkout counter is what matters most. Our analysis of the segment of Lulululemon traffic shows the same steep upward ascent in November. Initiatives paying off In an earnings preview distributed to Similarweb Investor Intelligence clients in October, our analysts wrote that “Lululemon continues to dominate the athleisure space despite competitors increasing promotional activity to sell off excess inventory.” They noted that Lululemon increased conversions “at Nike and Adidas’ expense” while executing strategies like expanding sales of footwear and men’s apparel. Meanwhile, Lululemon launched its two-tiered Studio Membership Program in late September to build customer loyalty and increase engagement and connection between their physical and digital platforms.
