So, what trends have been driving pet product sales up? üìà When looking at Similarweb Shopper Intelligence data, it turns out that pet owners are putting their pets on a health kick, and the market has gone crazy for health-related pet üêæ products. This is likely due to people increasingly treating their pets like family members (as they should!), applying the same health-conscious standards to their pets‚Äô diets as they do to their own. This trend has led to a recent rise in premium pet products and services, from high-end pet spas and boutique hotels to gourmet pet foods and supplements. It seems that, as we become more aware of our own health, we‚Äôre also more willing to invest in our pets‚Äô wellness. Interest in pet supplements is particularly on the rise, as we see a notable increase in the use of functional foods and supplements designed to address pets‚Äô specific health issues. For example, products that address joint health, improve skin and coat condition, and boost digestive health and overall wellness (like multivitamins) are in high demand. As a result, the market for pet supplements is expanding rapidly, with chewable, powdered, and liquid supplements being particularly popular due to their high absorption rates and ability to be easily mixed in with pet food‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and the data from our platform tells a very similar tale tail. Dog-related health products lead the pack Which pets come up trumps? Our data shows that it‚Äôs the dog category that saw the biggest year-over-year (YoY) increase, at 24.7%. And after going for a deeper dive into our platform, we saw that many of the top trending keywords reflect this growing health-conscious trend ‚Äì ‚Äòprobiotics for dogs‚Äô and ‚Äòsalmon oil for dogs‚Äô both experienced over 50% growth in search volume and clicks: What does this insight mean for pet supplies companies? With this kind of actionable data, they can: Innovate with combination products: Develop products that integrate popular supplements like probiotics and salmon oil, tapping into the growing demand for comprehensive health solutions Run targeted marketing campaigns: Highlight the specific health benefits of probiotics and salmon oil and other supplements to attract health-conscious pet owners Tailor subscription plans: Implement subscription models to ensure repeat purchases, encouraging customer loyalty and consistent revenue Cats are in for a real treat this year According to our Shopper Intelligence data, the Cat category has also experienced robust growth, with a 23% YoY increase in revenue. It appears that cat owners are more focused on making their furry friends feel special, with ‚Äòcat treats‚Äô experiencing a 36% YoY increase in revenue growth. But, what treats in particular are cats going paw-stively nuts for? It seems that Churu cat treats, known for their creamy, lickable texture have driven a massive 327% increase in keyword clicks. And the astonishing 14,427%(!) surge in searches for ‚Äòcatnips for cats‚Äô indicates massive market potential for brands. To capitalize on these trends, if you‚Äôre a pet supplies company you should: Innovate with new flavors and formulas: Introduce diverse cat treat options to capitalize on the growing demand. Shift to smart marketing efforts: Develop targeted campaigns focusing on the benefits and popularity of cat treats, especially catnip products. These insights underscore the dynamic growth in the pet supplies sector, driven by increasing consumer demand for health and treat products.
