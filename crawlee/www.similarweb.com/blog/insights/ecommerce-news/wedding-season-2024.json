April 26, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Wedding season is in full swing, which means consumers are beginning their quest for the perfect evening and party attire. Similarweb Digital Data provides invaluable insights into current consumer searches, trending products, and the ecommerce brands that are capitalizing on this seasonal event. ASOS loses dominance over ‘wedding guest dress’ related search traffic While ASOS once had a firm hold on the wedding apparel industry, Similarweb data shows it’s losing its lead, especially regarding consumer searches for wedding dresses. Search visits driven by keywords related to ‘wedding guest dress’ peaked in May 2023 compared to the last 15 months. Although ASOS captured an average of 11% of traffic between January and May 2023, their share of voice declined to 1.4% in March 2024. Following ASOS’s traffic loss, Shein and Amazon both saw traffic share growth, a trend they’ve maintained throughout 2024. Both sites offer event and formal wear at lower rates than competitors, suggesting that shoppers in 2024 tend to be more price-conscious than last year. Traffic volume for the ‘wedding guest’ keyword segment increased 23% month-over-month (MoM) in March 2024, a larger increase compared to 2023, indicating a rise in demand this year. With ASOS in a slight decline, coupled with the recent rise of consumer demand, clothing brands have an opportunity to enter the wedding apparel space and win some of the share of voice before the seasonal peak of May. Traffic to ‘Wedding Guest Dress’ categories increases by 23% in March Our web analytics shows that while traffic to the wedding guest segments of five popular domains (Nordstrom, Anthropologie, Amazon, Asos, and Abercrombie) increased by 23% year-over-year (YoY) in March 2024, ASOS saw a 42% loss. This reflects ASOS’ decline in search performance – the site went from a leading destination for wedding guest dress wear and apparel to falling behind competitors. Nordstrom’s segment for wedding guests stood out in March 2024 with a 51% increase in traffic YoY. This growth stems from organic search optimization and direct traffic, suggesting a strong brand association with the wedding guest dress. Nordstrom’s organic search success is derived from non-branded search terms such as ‘wedding guest dresses,’ seasonal keywords like ‘summer wedding guest dress,’ and dress specifications including ‘black tie wedding guest dress’ and ‘wedding guest dresses blue floral.’ The Similarweb Insights & Communications team is available to pull additional or updated data on request for the news media (journalists are invited to write to press@similarweb.com).
