Women’s fashion footwear brand Vivaia captured the #1 spot for Apparel & Accessories in Similarweb’s annual Digital 100 ranking of the online businesses with the most impressive growth. The average monthly visits to vivaia.com grew 654.6%, year-over-year, between 2022 and 2023. This finding is based on Similarweb’s report for the US, published today at similarweb.com/corp/digital-100/ with top 10 rankings for 10 industries: Apparel & Accessories, Automotive, Beauty & Cosmetics, Consumer Electronics, Food & Drinks, Home & Garden, News & Media, Personal Finance, Pet Care, and Travel & Tourism. Each of the winners was already operating a substantial online business in 2022, but significantly increased its reach in 2023. For Apparel & Accessories, the Top 10 in are: Site YoY Traffic Growth Market Segment vivaia.com 654.60% Women’s footwear musinsa.com 375.70% Retail hoooyi.com 195.00% Skateboard/lifestyle edikted.com 183.30% Fast fashion underoutfit.com 177.00% Shapewear sandyliang.info 162.40% Luxury rihoas.com 160.10% Fast fashion portlandleathergoods.com 153.60% Handmade finesse.us 139.10% Fast fashion pakaapparel.com 138.00% Ethical outdoor brand A few themes popped out at us when analyzing the results. The power of Gen Z Most of the winners owed their growth to strong traction with Gen Z (18 to 24 year old shoppers), who made up 27% of their audience on average, compared with an industry average of 12%. That was particularly true of Finesse (45% Gen Z) and Ediked (41%). Vivaia and Underoutfit were exceptions (12% and 10% Gen Z audience share). Environmental awareness A growing awareness of the fashion industry’s environmental impact coupled with rising inflation has led consumers to look to more sustainable retailers, mostly those ensuring sustainable materials and practices, such as Vivaia and Paka. Inclusivity Inclusivity is an increasingly important topic in the minds of the US consumer, and its impact can be seen in the growth of apparel brands offering unisex clothing (Hooyi) and plus sizes (At Finesse and Underoutfit, sizes’ range from XS to 3XL).

Digital 100 Methodology Building on Similarweb’s general methodology for creating a comprehensive model of the digital world, the Digital 100 project reveals the fastest growing web domains from pre-defined industry categories. Growth is measured as a percentage increase in average monthly traffic volume from 2022 to 2023. To qualify for inclusion, each domain had to meet a minimum average monthly traffic in both years. For the US, the minimum was 100,000 monthly visits in 2023 and 50,000 in 2022. A lower threshold was used for specific categories in other countries. Similarweb analysts then manually filtered the results to discover the most meaningful examples of digital business growth.
