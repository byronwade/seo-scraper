Global Air Travel Demand Looks Strong Entering 2023 After a year in which the trend of “revenge travel” led consumers to choose travel over other expenditures despite high airfares, demand remains strong ending the year. Key takeaways Aggregated web traffic for the nine largest U.S. airlines rose 7% in November 2022, year over year, but declined 3% from October. November traffic was up 110% over October 2020 (during the pandemic), and was flat compared with November 2019 (pre-pandemic). Aggregated web traffic for seven large U.K. airlines (Ryanair, EasyJet, Wizz Air, Jet2, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa) fell 5% in November 2022, year over year, and was down 15% from October, in what we see as a normal seasonal decline. November traffic was up 77% over November 2020 (during pandemic), and was up 1% over November 2019 (pre-pandemic). Aggregated web traffic for four large airlines serving Japan (Japan Airlines, ANA, flypeach and Jetstar) rose 22% in November 2022, year over year, but was down 7% from October. November traffic was up 33% over November 2020 (during the pandemic), but was still 12% below November 2019 (pre-pandemic). Aggregated web traffic for seven large Australian airlines (Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin Australia, Singapore Air, Rex, Emirates and Qatar Airways) rose 51% in November 2022, year over year, but was down 3% from October. Overall trends remain encouraging Despite some seasonal weakness, all global markets we looked at in this report are showing a recovery in demand, as reflected in air traffic.
