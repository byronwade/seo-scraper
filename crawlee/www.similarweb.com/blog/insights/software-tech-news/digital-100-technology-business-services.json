Carr 3 Min. January 25, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic A promotional platform for creators and influencers topped the list, followed by tools for managing HR, marketing, and sales In the Similarweb Digital 100 category for business tools and services, the top spot went to Snipfeed, a monetization platform for creators and influencers – they call it a “monetization platform built in a bio link”. Total traffic to snipfeed.co increased 374.7% between 2021 and 2022, according to Similarweb estimates. Technology & Business Services is one of 10 key categories that make up the annual Similarweb Digital 100 ranking of the fastest-growing companies on the web. The ranking is based on desktop and mobile web traffic from the United States (see also the reports for the U.K., Germany, France, and Japan, with one for Australia to follow. Key takeaways Social media remains a powerful force. Snipfeed gets 44.4% of its traffic from social media, which makes sense given the nature of its business, and is particularly popular among Gen Z’ers (18-24-year-olds) and millennials (25-34). Of its other referrals, onlyfans.com is at the top of the list, with several other adult sites close behind. Snipfeed enjoys 51.7% direct traffic, reflecting strong brand recognition and repeat business. Overall, 18% of desktop traffic to the category winners was driven by referrals and 5.4% by social media. Making commerce easier pays off. Tremendous, which ranks second with a +326.5% increase, is a business-to-consumer payments platform that provides quick and free global payment services through gift cards, cash payouts, and donations. The other winners on the list make business management simpler, from marketing (roirocket.com, +191.2%) and, scheduling (servicefusion.com, +43.5%) to managing a workforce (timeco.com, +58.4%, and workhuman.com, +54.9%). Brand recognition matters. Taken as a group, the Technology & Business Services winners get more than 70% direct traffic – users coming straight to their websites, indicating strong brand recognition and return visits. On average, they get 13.8% of their traffic from referrals. While the category winner helps solo self-promoters, others in the top 10 focused on managing employees or greasing the wheels of digital commerce. For example, #2 Tremendous is a business-to-consumer payments and incentives platform focused on helping businesses send gift cards and cash payouts or make a donation to the individual’s favorite charity. The rest cover different aspects of marketing, selling, and managing a workforce.
