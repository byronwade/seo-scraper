Stadia had once been advertised as a market disruptor with its attractive offering of instantly accessing games on any device paired with its tagline as “the newest, most logic-defying, mind-bending, absurd gaming platform on earth! Forget boxes. Forget consoles. Just your games – your screens – and electric air. And this electric air is… STADIA!” Key takeaways In the month of its launch, November 2019, the platform had reached nearly 700,000 unique visitors, plateauing at around an average of 518,236 unique visitors from December 2019 – March 2020. In April 2020, Google launched the free tier of Stadia, giving Stadia Pro subscriptions free of cost for 2 months. Coming on top of their EA Arts partnership announcement to launch five EA games on Stadia, this led to a 686% increase in unique visitors from March to April 2020, reaching over 4.3M unique visitors that month alone. Shortly after its first anniversary, Stadia saw its largest surge in users in December 2020 at the time of its iOS launch, expansion into more countries, Ubisoft+ partnership launch, and Google giving free Stadia bundles to YouTube Premium subscribers. The platform’s audience grew 85% from November to December 2020, reaching 6.65M unique visitors in December. Stadia was unable to sustain the growth from its December 2020 surge, decreasing -56.46% by January 2021 and plateauing around an average of 2.1M monthly unique visitors for the rest of 2021. The shuttering of the company’s first-party Stadia game development studios in February 2021 marked the beginning of Stadia’s decline. The platform’s lack of popular exclusive games and a small catalog meant it faced competitive disadvantages that stunted its growth for the remainder of its run. Stadia saw an 8% decline in unique visitors YoY from 2020 to 2021. Furthermore, 2022 showed less promising results – with each passing month showing large year-over-year audience declines. Period over-period data shows Stadia faced a 27% decline in unique visitors from January – August 2022 compared to the same period last year. Less than 3 years after its launch, Google pulled the plug on Stadia following an unstable development phase and an even more unstable post-release phase. Months of setbacks snowballed into an unsuccessful product that failed to compete with market leaders like Xbox Game Pass which offered subscription models with better value. Ultimately, mounting consumer skepticism and unprofitability overshadowed the remainder of Stadia’s future potential, leading to its rapid demise. In January 2023, Stadia will join Google’s long list of shuttered experiments – though its legacy will live on in other Google ventures.
