The SimilarPoll 2022 Midterm Election Survey provides real-time election polling featuring responses from over 23,000 unique panelists nationwide and reveals that economic concerns are swaying voters: both Democrats and Republicans ranked “Inflation and Cost of Living” and “Economy” as the most important issues in America today while ‘Abortion’ is not as prominent in these voters minds as might have been expected, given the intense politics around that issue. The poll Similarweb’s proprietary Market Research Panel – a daily sentiment tracker of mobile phone users in the United States – to engage directly with users on their mobile devices and qualify attitudes and behaviors. Used commercially to provide businesses with a comprehensive view of consumer activity in the mobile ecosystem, this curated, longitudinal data-gathering proved remarkably accurate in the 2020 US presidential election and has been updated for analysis of key U.S. Senate and gubernatorial races. We also gathered a state-by-state breakdown of the panelists’ most important issues. Because we are able to poll survey participants on an ongoing basis, using their most recent responses as their views change, SimilarPoll provides a unique perspective that traditional polling cannot easily capture. Here is a peek at one key chart, which shows the state results where one party is favored by more than the poll’s margin of error: For more details, including state-by-state breakdowns, download the full report.
