January 25, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Buy Now Pay Later and alternative financing services saw great gains With 2022 traffic growth that topped 3,000%, Synchrony is the #1 Financial Services company in the Digital 100. The company offers merchants private label credit cards and alternative financing products, including Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services. Financial Services is one of 10 key categories that make up the annual Similarweb Digital 100 ranking of the fastest-growing companies on the web. The ranking is based on desktop and mobile web traffic from the United States (see also the reports for the U.K., Germany, France, and Japan, with one for Australia to follow. Key takeaways BNPL credit experienced major growth as a way for consumers to stretch their budgets. BNPL was part of the story of Synchrony’s success, and other BNPL players who made the top 10 included Uplift (up 139.7%) and Zip (up 127.5%). Adventurous uses of money still draw traffic. NovaTech, a foreign exchange and cryptocurrency trading platform, turned up at #2 on the list, despite the current decline in enthusiasm for crypto, up 518.4%. Referrals are key. Second only to direct traffic (50.8%), referrals drove 31.4% of the traffic to the fastest-growing finance sites. Synchrony brought in the most traffic across the direct, search, referral, and social channels, and ranked second for display advertising traffic. The biggest Digital 100 theme is what we’re calling “The Year of the Cost-Conscious Consumer,” and financial services was one of the areas where we saw consumers looking for ways to stretch and continue to make purchases at a time of elevated inflation and budget sensitivity. Somewhat bucking the trend toward economizing was NovaTech, at #2 with 518% growth for a site specializing in foreign and exchange and cryptocurrency trading – relatively adventurous uses of money – although right behind it was treasurydirect.gov, the official U.S. government website for buying and trading bonds, a more conservative investment. The Mohela servicer of federal student aid also made it into the top 10, likely because of President Biden’s program aimed at forgiving student loans – a plan currently tied up in court challenges.
