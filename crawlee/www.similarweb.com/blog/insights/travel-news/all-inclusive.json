The websites for all-inclusive resort vacations are growing much faster than the broader hotels and accommodations category, reflecting increased consumer interest, both in the US and worldwide. Key takeaways In April, US traffic to all-inclusive resort websites was up 14.7% year-over-year versus 1.2% for the broader hotels and accommodations category. Worldwide traffic for all-inclusives was up 16.9%, compared with 3.2% for hospitality overall. Using a trailing 12-month analysis to see the longer-term trend, US traffic to all-inclusive websites is up 18%, versus 2.2% for hospitality overall. That’s calculated using the last 12 months of traffic, versus the previous year. Some all-inclusive resorts saw even bigger increases. For example, US traffic to alltrabyplaya.com was up 131% over the trailing 12 months period, while excellenceresorts.com – also one of the largest by traffic volume – enjoyed a traffic increase of 39%. How all-inclusives stack up versus hospitality in general All-inclusive resorts have a value proposition somewhat similar to a cruise, offering a relatively fixed price for a luxury bundle of services. As a recent article in Nerdwallet notes, many consumers appreciate making it easier to budget for a vacation, even if the price is not the lowest. Largest and fastest-growing all-inclusives websites in the US Longtime category leader Sandals (sandals.com) got the most traffic from the US in April, more than 1.7 million visits, followed by RIU Hotels & Resorts (riu.com) with 1.2 million visits. The all-inclusive brands with the fastest-growing websites, measured by traffic growth over the last 12 months versus the previous year, are alltrabyplaya.com, palladiumhotelgroup.com, theexcellencecollection.com, excellenceresorts.com, and playaresorts.com. Two of these, excellenceresorts.com and theexcellencecollection.com, offer different promotions for the same brand. Where are they getting all that traffic growth? Much of their traffic comes from organic search, although paid channels also play a role, with alltrabyplaya.com getting about one third of its traffic from paid search. Of the five fastest growing, excellenceresorts.com is the largest by traffic volume, getting most of its traffic from search – 78.5% from organic search and the rest from search advertising. Much of that organic search traffic is driven by branded searches for specific resort properties like “excellence playa mujeres.” Fastest-growing all-inclusives websites, worldwide Worldwide, RIU and Meliá (melia.com) attract the most traffic, followed by Sandals. The fastest growing all-inclusive sites, worldwide, based on our trailing 12 months growth analysis, are playaresorts.com, up 70.8%, followed by clubmed.co.jp, theexcellencecollection.com, palladiumhotelgroup.com, clubmed.com.br, and clubmed.be, all up more than 30%. Note that includes three different Club Med properties that are growing in popularity.
