Despite the global scale of the Olympics, travel to Paris for the 2024 games does not appear to be surging. While there are signs of increased interest in travel to France, it seems to be going to other regions of the country. Decline in bookings for Paris lodging Overall, lodging bookings for the city made during the first six months of this year have decreased by 14% compared to the same period last year. Although vacation rental bookings experienced some growth earlier this year, it pales in comparison to the significant increases seen across all categories at the beginning of 2023. Consistent yet declining: Top countries for travel to Paris The top countries driving travel to Paris have remained consistent with last year, but most have seen a year-over-year decrease in travel compared to the same period. The US is the only exception, showing a modest increase of nearly 5%. Changing trends among top countries Two countries showing some of the highest increases in those traveling to Paris from last year include Serbia (88% YoY growth), with 112 participants in the Olympics and possibly driven by an interest in what might be Novak Djokovic’s last Olympics, and Croatia (73% YoY growth), with 75 participants, known for its remarkable success in the sporting world. Going beyond Paris: Growing interest in France’s diverse regions Travel to Paris for the Olympics hasn’t seen a significant surge among most top countries, but overall summer travel to France appears to be higher than last year. For instance, Air France has seen an increase in bookings through their website in the US, the UK, and Germany, as visits to the airline’s payment page from these countries show YoY increases in the first half of this year. While the US stands out as one of the few top countries experiencing an increase in travelers to Paris YoY, many other French regions are seeing even greater gains in popularity. Despite YoY declines in travelers from the UK and Germany, Paris remains the most sought-after destination in France for accommodations. However, interest in other French regions is rising. Seaside towns like Biarritz and Cannes are becoming increasingly popular among French and UK travelers. Lille is gaining traction with visitors from the UK and Germany, and Annecy is attracting more interest from German tourists in particular. High lodging prices in Paris during the Olympics might encourage travelers to explore other regions. For example, Lille, less than a two-hour train ride from Paris, has grown increasingly popular among visitors from the US, UK and Germany. This suggests that while travelers prefer to base themselves in other regions during their holidays, they still perhaps seek convenient access to the capital for shorter day trips.
