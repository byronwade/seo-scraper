Japan Rail Pass captured the #1 spot for Travel and Tourism in Similarweb’s annual Digital 100 ranking of the online businesses with the most impressive growth. The average monthly visits to jrailpass.com grew 239%, year-over-year, between 2022 and 2023. This finding is based on Similarweb’s Digital 100 report for the US, published today at similarweb.com/corp/digital-100/ with top 10 rankings for 10 industries: Apparel & Accessories, Automotive, Beauty & Cosmetics, Consumer Electronics, Food & Drinks, Home & Garden, News & Media, Personal Finance, Pet Care, and Travel & Tourism. Each of the winners was already operating a substantial online business in 2022, but significantly increased its reach in 2023. For Travel & Tourism, the Top 10 in are: Site YoY Traffic Growth Market Segment jrailpass.com 238.90% Japan railroad tickets spotlight.vegas 216.10% Las Vegas travel booking oneworldobservatory.com 212.30% Attraction at the top of the World Trade Center zipair.net 210.60% Airline japanwondertravel.com 203.30% Japan guided tours flynorse.com 183.40% Airline klook.com 181.00% Travel experiences aqvoyages.com 180.60% River cruises china-airlines.com 174.30% Airline gobrightline.com 162.10% Florida’s new high speed railroad Some themes from the results: Japan is a hot destination Together with #5 ranked japanwondertravel.com, up 203%, Japan Rail Pass reflects the rising popularity of Japan as a destination for American travelers. Japan is the fastest-growing destination for Gen Z and Millennials, according to a study by American Express. Seeking out discounts US consumers want to travel, but they are actively seeking out the best values before booking. Thus, the rise of Zipair, which joins other airlines offering basic travel at a discount. Destinations include Tokyo, so its success might also reflect the Japan travel boom, but it also flies to destinations on the US West Coast as well as Honolulu, Seoul, Manilla, Bangkok, and Singapore. We also see the desire for discounts in the popularity of Spotlight Vegas and Klook. Experiences attract The drive for unique experiences brought traffic to One World Observatory, an attraction atop the rebuilt World Trade Center in New York, and American Queen Voyages (aqvoyages.com), which offers river cruises and “expeditions” in the US and Canada.

Digital 100 Methodology Building on Similarweb’s general methodology for creating a comprehensive model of the digital world, the Digital 100 project reveals the fastest growing web domains from pre-defined industry categories. Growth is measured as a percentage increase in average monthly traffic volume from 2022 to 2023. To qualify for inclusion, each domain had to meet a minimum average monthly traffic in both years. For the US, the minimum was 100,000 monthly visits in 2023 and 50,000 in 2022. A lower threshold was used for specific categories in other countries. Similarweb analysts then manually filtered the results to discover the most meaningful examples of digital business growth.
