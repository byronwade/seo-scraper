Bluesky’s Web Traffic Grew 37%, while US App Users Rose 30% in February Try Similarweb by David F. Carr 2 Min. March 11, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Bluesky showed the strongest growth of any of X’s challengers despite being one of the smallest In the first month after Bluesky dropped the requirement for new users to have an invite code, web traffic to bsky.app grew by 37% worldwide. In addition, mobile app users in the US increased by 30% for iOS and Android combined, according to Similarweb estimates. Worldwide, monthly active users for the Android version of Bluesky were up 57%, month-over-month (Mom). Backed by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, Bluesky is potentially one of the most formidable challengers to Elon Musk’s X. However, it has purposely limited its growth while solving certain engineering challenges. Bluesky aims to replicate Twitter on a distributed computing model, incorporating concepts similar to the blockchain model used by cryptocurrencies. Regardless of the technical virtues of that approach, up until recently, Bluesky wasn’t as convenient of an option for those seeking a Twitter / X alternative. Meta’s Threads, a spinoff from Instagram, has made more progress but still lags far behind X. Here’s the current ranking based on mobile app usage in the US: The Similarweb Insights & Communications team is available to pull additional or updated data on request for the news media (journalists are invited to write to press@similarweb.com).
