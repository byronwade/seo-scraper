July 18, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic In the rapidly evolving SEO landscape, standing out requires a blend of innovation, strategy, and impeccable execution. ELOREA, a Korean perfume brand, has exemplified this by skyrocketing to the top of search results and capturing the hearts of US consumers. This blog post delves into ELOREA‚Äôs remarkable journey and provides actionable insights on how you can replicate their success using Similarweb‚Äôs digital marketing suite. Riding the K-wave: Market timing and positioning ELOREA‚Äôs journey began in mid-2023 with a rising trend in the beauty and personal care market. By capitalizing on the burgeoning demand for Korean beauty products in the US, ELOREA positioned itself uniquely within a rapidly expanding niche. Driven by a strong presence on TikTok and other social platforms, ELOREA capitalized on this trend by entering the market early. This strategic timing, combined with effective positioning, resulted in a 2,811% increase in organic traffic. Branded keywords lead the way A critical factor in ELOREA‚Äôs success was its focus on branded keywords. An astounding 84% of their searches were for branded terms, indicating high demand and strong purchase intent. This strong brand presence was a significant driver of the company‚Äôs success in growing organic traffic. What‚Äôs interesting about the brand is its homepage ranking on broad terms, some of which are transactional, including: Korean fragrance Korean perfume Korean perfume brands We‚Äôd assume the search intent for terms like Korean perfume would result in listicles that include popular perfumes or perhaps transactional pages. A brand‚Äôs homepage, on the other hand, is unexpected. The question is, how did ELOREA rank its homepage on these broad terms? Sniffing out success What‚Äôs perplexing is that ELOREA‚Äôs site doesn‚Äôt have the strong SEO signals you would expect to explain such high rankings. Looking at the homepage, the only mention of Korea is: In the title tag In three words of body text (which is below the fold) Additionally, the ‚ÄòOur Story‚Äô page, which establishes the brand as a Korean perfume company, surprisingly has no text. Instead, all of the page‚Äôs text is embedded within an image, which is suboptimal for SEO purposes. Yet, these minimal SEO elements somehow managed to secure top rankings for broad search terms. The mystery of missing keywords Another puzzling aspect of ELOREA‚Äôs SEO success concerns its backlink profile. While anchor text is typically a critical factor in SEO, especially when it includes relevant keywords, ELOREA‚Äôs backlinks notably lack mentions of the word ‚ÄúKorea.‚Äù With minimal SEO elements present, how does the brand rank for Korean perfume terms? Looking at the product descriptions Although ELOREA‚Äôs product pages do not include the word Korea in their title tags, they do feature subtle mentions of Korean ingredients as well as brief product descriptions in Korean. These small mentions contribute to the overall perception of ELOREA as a Korean perfume brand. Entity connections: The key to high rankings Perhaps the answer to ELOREA‚Äôs SEO success can be found in Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph. Across the web, ELOREA is contextually connected to Korea. The brand‚Äôs social media accounts, which have substantial followers and rank on its brand SERP, clearly present ELOREA as a Korean perfumery. Furthermore, numerous tier-1 publications and blogs describe the brand as a Korean fragrance line, including: The New York Times Allure Various beauty-focused blogs There are also blog posts on the SERP ranking for Korean perfume keywords that link to the ELOREA homepage and list ELOREA as a Korean perfume brand. Contextual connections: Leveraging entity SEO Although ELOREA has minimal on-page SEO and no keyword-focused anchor text, all of these brand mentions help Google understand what the site is about. Especially the pages that mention Korean perfume brands. As a result, Google has gradually ‚Äòlearned‚Äô what the brand is about and has incorporated ELOREA into its Knowledge Graph, establishing a strong association between the brand and entities like perfume and Korea. Competitors missing the mark Interestingly, ELOREA‚Äôs competitors ‚Äì including RboW and Tamburins ‚Äì rarely mention ‚ÄúKorea‚Äù in their content, giving ELOREA a unique competitive edge as a ‚ÄòKorean beauty brand.‚Äô This strategic differentiation helps ELOREA stand out as perhaps the only perfume brand with a strong tie to Korea. The result: ELOREA ranks in search results for highly competitive terms related to Korean perfume. Scent-sational tips to boost your brand entity online To enhance your brand‚Äôs online presence, educate Google about your brand entity by acquiring mentions across relevant websites. Focus on getting your brand mentioned in content that is contextually related to your niche. Consistently achieving mentions on high-traffic, authoritative sites will help associate your brand with your chosen topic and increase Google‚Äôs confidence in your site‚Äôs relevance. Acquiring brand mentions is closely related to acquiring links, as link-building efforts inevitably result in brand mentions as well. Here are some tips to get started with acquiring brand mentions: üîé Analyze competitors‚Äô backlinks in your niche: Using link analysis tools, identify websites that frequently link to multiple competitors. These sites are more likely to link to your content as well, given their history of referencing resources in your field. ‚úçÔ∏è Create valuable assets for third-party sites: Based on your analysis, try to understand which assets acquire the most links. Are they free tools, data visualizations, or informative content? Identify patterns in what others consistently link to, then create superior versions of these assets. üí¨ Conduct strategic outreach: Build genuine connections with media professionals in your niche. Reach out to relevant sites to acquire links or brand mentions, leveraging your high-quality assets. Educate Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph and win ELOREA‚Äôs ascent to the top of the digital perfume market demonstrates the power of strategically positioning a brand entity alongside closely related entities in Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph. By implementing this approach in a niche where competitors overlooked this strategy, ELOREA achieved significant growth and market visibility. Do you want to emulate this success in your business?
