October 11, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Key Takeaways: The pet health market is rapidly growing, with a 54% year-over-year increase in searches for salmon fish oil and a 25% surge for dog probiotics. Amazon is the primary platform for pet health products, generating $1.6 billion in annual revenue for dog health supplies. Paid search now accounts for one-third of clicks in the dog health category, highlighting the critical need for brands to invest in digital marketing strategies to maintain competitive visibility. As pet ownership continues to rise, so does the emphasis on keeping our pets healthy. The pet health market has seen remarkable growth, particularly across brand websites and Amazon. In this blog, we use Similarweb‚Äôs Web Intelligence tools and Shopper Intelligence to reveal the consumer trends shaping this booming segment. We‚Äôll highlight the leading brands and discuss strategies for success in this competitive space ‚Äî with a special focus on what‚Äôs happening on Amazon, the world‚Äôs largest marketplace. Demand surges for dog health products Our analysis began with the creation of keyword groups for pet health. We found searches for dog health-related products, such as probiotics and salmon fish oil, have surged. Search volumes increased 25% and 54% year-over-year (YoY), respectively, from September 2023 to August 2024 compared to the previous year. Interestingly, the total search volume for dog probiotics (778K) is 4.5 times higher than that of salmon fish oil (171K), indicating a clear preference for probiotics.

However, many consumers conduct thorough research before purchasing, with publishers also capturing a significant share of clicks. Source: Similarweb Shopper Intelligence Key takeaway: To succeed in this space, brands should prioritize visibility on these marketplaces while also building credibility through partnerships with influential publishers. Dog health supplies on Amazon reach new heights The dog health supplies category on Amazon reached $1.6B in annual revenue with a 31% YoY increase in both revenue and units sold. This reflects sustained consumer demand. Interestingly, prices have remained relatively stable, indicating the revenue growth is primarily driven by an uptick in sales. Source: Similarweb Shopper Intelligence Amazon‚Äôs Subscribe & Save remains a key driver Subscribe & Save feature ‚Äì the Amazon program that enables customers to automatically receive recurring shipments of select products at regular intervals ‚Äì continues to gain momentum. It now accounts for around 20% of all category sales. Over the past 18 months, its share has grown from 9% to 19.7%, making it a critical tool for brands looking to drive repeat purchases. Subscribe & Save‚Äôs convenience is particularly appealing to consumers seeking long-term pet health solutions. Source: Similarweb Shopper Intelligence Growth is seen across all subcategories A remarkable 13 out of 15 subcategories within the dog health market have witnessed substantial growth in revenue and units sold over the past year. This broad-based trend suggests a growing consumer focus on pet health, not just individual products or brands. The top three subcategories ‚Äì Supplements & Vitamins, Hip & Joint Care, and Digestive Remedies ‚Äì account for 62% of total category revenue. Digestive Remedies have seen the most significant growth, with a 51% YoY revenue increase. Source: Similarweb Shopper Intelligence Zesty Paws remains the alpha dog, but competition is heating up Zesty Paws continues to lead the dog health category, with 14.5 million product views ‚Äì double that of the second-place brand, Nutramax Laboratories. Despite this, Zesty Paws posted only modest revenue growth of 8%, while Nutramax Laboratories saw a 34% increase. Source: Similarweb Shopper Intelligence Smaller players like Petlab Co., VetIQ, and Native Pet are making rapid strides, with revenue growth rates of 71%, 86%, and 93%, respectively. üí° Key takeaway: This surge in competition underscores the fierce battle for market share in this expanding retail segment. The battle for brand association continues to intensify Consumers aren‚Äôt overly fixated on specific brands when searching for dog health products, presenting both opportunities and challenges for brands. The top keywords in this category are brand-agnostic, a common feature of new or rapidly growing markets. Several brands are actively claiming keyword ownership: Zesty Paws dominates ‚Äòsalmon oil for dogs,‚Äô Arm & Hammer leads for ‚Äòdog toothpaste,‚Äô and GKD captures 40% of clicks for ‚Äòcalming chews for dogs.‚Äô This spread of product categories further emphasizes the broad consumer interest in pet health, with no single product driving growth. Source: Similarweb Shopper Intelligence Successful brands have top products across sub-categories Top brands like Zesty Paws, Nutramax Laboratories, and VetIQ have established top-selling products in multiple subcategories, which plays a key factor in their success. Consumers often purchase a range of products for their pets‚Äô health. So building trust as a brand across different product lines helps drive loyalty and cross-category sales. Source: Similarweb Shopper Intelligence Paid search is booming, now responsible for one-third of clicks Paid search has seen a significant increase. It now accounts for approximately one-third of total clicks in the dog health category. This further highlights the growing competitiveness of the space, as brands strive for greater marketplace visibility. Source: Similarweb Shopper Intelligence üí° Key takeaway: To compete effectively, brands need to allocate a substantial portion of their budget to paid search to capture at least a third of their clicks. Organic visibility alone may not be enough in this saturated market. Nutramax Laboratories thrives with strategic paid search investment Nutramax Laboratories has emerged as the leader in units sold, largely due to its investment in paid search. With 40% of its product clicks coming from paid search, it‚Äôs outpacing competitors in driving sales volume. Source: Similarweb Shopper Intelligence üí° Key takeaway: Nutramax Laboratories‚Äô example highlights the importance of paid search in securing brand recognition, especially in non-branded keyword searches where competition is fierce and brand loyalty is still forming.
