June 27, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic In the ever-competitive world of digital marketing, staying ahead requires a blend of strategy, creativity, and data-driven decisions. Wildgrain, a frozen carb delivery service, exemplifies this blend with its remarkable content-led SEO strategy. In this blog, we’ll explore some key strategies that resulted in 600% organic growth in 2023, including: Keyword clustering Targeting multiple search intents Brand focused SEO Plus, we’ll show you how to leverage Similarweb’s digital marketing suite to achieve similar results for your business. Carb-loading content: Dominating the top pages In a market dominated by giants like Amazon and Walmart, Wildgrain’s blog strategy helps them carve – or should we say carb – out a unique space. These big players typically do not invest heavily in detailed blog content. Wildgrain, on the other hand, is capturing a significant amount of organic traffic through its blog. In fact, an impressive 75% of its top pages are blog posts, each targeting low-competition, long-tail keywords. This strategy not only drives traffic but also allows Wildgrain to engage users at various stages of the customer journey. Clustering keywords: A recipe for success Wildgrain’s strategy extends beyond single keywords to clustering related search terms. By recognizing user intent, they group queries that have: Similar user intent Multiple related user intents This enables them to create comprehensive blog posts that enhance SEO performance and improve user experience by providing thorough, relevant information, all in one place. This approach has helped a single blog, ‘Bread vs. Pasta vs. Rice vs. Potatos’, to rank for 714 keywords, demonstrating the power of keyword clustering. Targeting multiple user intents in a single blog post Although Google has trained us to target a single user intent (or keyword) per page, Wildgrain is able to expand its reach dramatically by creatively breaking this rule. For instance, in a blog post entitled ‘What’s Better: Bread vs. Pasta vs. Rice vs. Potatoes?’, Wildgrain simultaneously mapped and targeted terms like: Rice vs bread Potato vs rice Bread vs potatoes Carbs bread vs potatoes While these terms represent different search intents, Wildgrain unifies them under the broader concept of comparing carbohydrates – effectively treating them as one overarching intent. The results are evident, with these pages ranking for hundreds of keywords and driving substantial traffic to its site. Templating and scaling: Efficient content production Success in content marketing often hinges on scalability. Wildgrain excels in this area by templatizing its content creation process. This involves using a consistent format for blog posts, which includes a standard image, question-based H2 headers, and posts authored by experts with PhDs in nutrition. Each post is meticulously crafted, averaging 800-1,000 words, to ensure depth and quality. Maintaining quality at scale Despite producing content at scale, Wildgrain maintains high standards of quality. Their emphasis on Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trust (EEAT) is evident in every post. By including disclaimers and ensuring content is written by qualified professionals, they build credibility with both users and search engines. Leveraging branded SEO: Control the narrative Wildgrain has mastered the art of branded SEO, ensuring that their brand-related searches lead users to their own content. This is particularly evident in their customer review strategy. Curious carb-loaders: ‘Wildgrain reviews’ search terms increase As Wildgrain’s brand awareness grows, so does the search volume for ‘Wildgrain reviews,’ which currently garners over 2,000 monthly searches. Recognizing the high intent behind these queries, Wildgrain has created their own review page, featuring over 28,860 customer reviews. This page ranks #1 in search results, boasting a five-star rating and effectively pushing third-party review sites like Trustpilot lower in the rankings. This ensures a higher likelihood of seeing visitors continue through the funnel, as they’re already within the company website. Zero-click searches: Satisfying users before they click Interestingly, 72% of review-related searches result in zero clicks, meaning users find their answers directly on the search results page which is most likely influenced by Wildgrain’s impressive review rich result. However, of the remaining 28%, Wildgrain captures 57% of the clicks, demonstrating the effectiveness of its branded SEO strategy in driving high-intent traffic to Wildgrain’s site. Tips and key takeaways SEO tip: When it comes to branded SEO, ensure that your brand’s narrative is controlled through strategic content creation. Optimize pages for searches related to ‘[brand] + [term]’ to capture traffic and influence user perception. This includes creating detailed “About Us” pages, comprehensive review sections, and informative comparison pages to manage your brand’s story effectively. Key takeaways: Target low-competition long-tail keywords: Focus on these keywords to bring large volumes of relevant traffic to your site. Templatize and scale your blog frameworks: This allows for faster content production and a consistent user experience. Don’t neglect branded SEO: Own all branded queries, even negative ones, to control your narrative and drive traffic to your site.
