June 6, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic As summer heats up, so does the desire for fun and refreshing treats at home. This season, the Ninja Creami ice cream maker by Ninja Kitchen has become a hot topic, with search demand skyrocketing over the past month due to strong organic interest and Pay Per Click (PPC) marketing. Whether you’re a retailer looking to boost online sales or a marketer aiming to capture new trends, understanding the dynamics of this market, especially within leading marketplaces like Amazon, can provide a significant competitive edge. Let’s dive into the latest insights and see how you can make the most of this opportunity. The rise in search demand for Ninja Creami Over the last three months, search interest in the Ninja Creami ice cream maker has seen a remarkable increase. This surge indicates a growing consumer interest in making homemade ice cream, driven by the combination of summer heat and the convenience offered by Ninja’s innovative home appliance. Our analysis reveals that the top paid keyword competitors over the past month in the UK include genieshopping.com, amazon.co.uk, and argos.co.uk, with ao.com also making a notable appearance in 16th place. This competitive landscape underscores the importance of strategic keyword bidding and targeted advertising to capture consumer attention. Ninja Creami’s top competitors and their strategies By diving deeper into the data, we identified the leading competitors in the paid search landscape for Ninja Creami. Using Similarweb’s Last 28 Days view (as of May 18), prominent players include genieshopping.com, amazon.co.uk, and argos.co.uk. Additionally, ninjakitchen.co.uk – Ninja’s D2C website – is receiving just below 70% of the domain search clicks, amounting to 34K monthly visits. These insights provide a clear view of who’s actively vying for market share in this space. Using Similarweb’s Landing Page Analyzer, we analyzed amazon.co.uk’s top paid landing pages for Ninja Creami. This revealed the specific keywords Ninja targeted, such as “Ninja Creami best price” and “buy Ninja Creami online,” giving us a blueprint of successful Amazon strategies. By understanding and leveraging these keywords, you can enhance your own campaigns to attract more traffic. Insights for maximizing revenue Let’s translate this data into actionable insights. If you’re a marketer selling kitchen appliances or other related products that are seasonal or impacted by consumer trends, consider increasing your spend on high-performing keywords within your space. By driving an additional 3,000 visits to its Ninja Creami landing pages on Amazon, Ninja Kitchen was able to see a substantial revenue boost. Here’s a rough calculation of what that looked like for Ninja: Conversion Rate: 2% Average Order Value (AOV): £150 Additional Website Visits: 3,000 With these parameters, Ninja was able to drive an extra £9,000 (or $11,400) in monthly revenue, amounting to $135,000 annually. This simple yet effective strategy underscores the potential of targeted paid keyword investment, which can be achieved using Similarweb’s Paid Search Tools. What else can you do if you’re a retailer selling on both your own website and Amazon? While your D2C presence should be prioritized, when consumer demand is high it is worth directing more traffic to marketplaces where conversion rates are high. Ninja has deliberately directed its PPC spend away from its own website and into Amazon, benefiting from positive ROI. At the same time, optimizing your D2C site for organic and direct traffic is paramount for ecommerce. Don’t get complacent because you have a strong brand – make sure you’re optimizing for the right branded keywords and delivering a good user experience, creating easy user journeys geared towards sales or conversions.
