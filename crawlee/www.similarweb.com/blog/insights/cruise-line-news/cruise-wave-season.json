That means consumer interest is strong, giving the cruise lines many opportunities to win bookings. Fastest Growing Brands The brands with the biggest year-over-year (YoY) percentage growth were the MSC Cruises USA (+32.9%) and Holland America (+26%). Royal Caribbean + Celebrity up 11% YoY Royal Caribbean (royalcaribbean.com) attracted the most traffic of any cruise brand, 16.9 million visits for the quarter, up 14% YoY. Royal Caribbean owns Celebrity (celebritycruises.com), and for the two combined traffic was up 11% YoY. Traffic to Carnival Cruise Lines flagship website, carnival.com, was flat, but traffic was up to princess.com (+11%) and hollandamerica.com (+26%). For those three brands combined traffic was up 7% YoY. Growth by challenger brands MSC Cruises, a fast-growing challenger brand, saw a 21.4% YoY gain across three websites (msccruisesusa.com, msccruises.com, and msccrociere.it), with the US website showing the strongest gain, up 33% YoY for the quarter. Virgin Voyages, the smallest of the cruise brands Similarweb has been tracking, saw web traffic growth of 20%, attracting 2.7 million visits worldwide.
