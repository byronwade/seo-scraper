Super Bowl’s First OT in 7 Years Fuels Betting App Frenzy Start your free trial by Daniel Reid 4 Min. February 13, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic The Super Bowl was an electrifying game with a nail-biting finish – only the second overtime in Super Bowl history – that left fans of the Kansas City Chiefs (and Taylor Swift) with cause for celebration. But who else were the big winners of Super Bowl LVIII? To take the game’s digital measure, we engaged the Similarweb market research panel to answer questions and allow us to track their actual game day app usage. Key takeaways: Overtime increased Sports Betting activity a whopping 184% vs the daily average DoorDash owned a third of Food Delivery app sessions, boosted by their in-game advertising DraftKings didn’t manage to win the hearts of Fantasy fans but remains the app of choice for Sports Bettors From stadiums, to living rooms, to the digital world with apps Super Bowl fans chose to watch the game several different ways – some watched with family, some chose to watch alone at home, some attended watching parties and a smaller number still chose the local sports bar as their venue of choice. But one thing we can be sure of is that the majority of these fans also used an app of some variety to enhance their experience of the game. In fact, over a quarter (27%) said they had planned to use a Food Delivery app to feast on some tasty treats during the match, while close to one in five said that they would use a Sports Betting app in a bid to beat the house and a similar proportion were hoping to get those vital end-of-season points in their Fantasy Football teams. Who were the app winners? Food delivery app usage began to climb as early as 7:00 am as fans began their game day preparations and got their food orders in early with this activity peaking at 6:00 pm – half an hour before kick-off. Fans betting on the game’s outcome also started early in the day but began to gather steam an hour before the game began. However, the rush of overtime added to the frenzy with people scrambling to their favorite betting services to right their previous wrongs (or look to make some extra cash from their winnings!). Fantasy Football fans’ activity followed a similar trajectory to those using Sports Betting apps, with activity ramping up right up until kick-off, followed by a small decline and a large spike as the game went into OT. PrizePicks Takes Home the Trophy: Most Popular Fantasy App When it came to fans’ Fantasy Football app of choice, PrizePicks had the lion’s share of overall sessions on the day of the game with a consistent share of sessions each hour. DraftKings secured over 50% of the sessions between 8:00-9:00 am while SuperDraft managed to draw an audience during the game itself. DoorDash Delivers Touchdown as Top Snack Source DoorDash owned 34% of Food Delivery app sessions over the day. However, perhaps because of their ads during the game, this jumped up to close to 50% of sessions once kick-off had occurred – and kept climbing after the game ended. Those looking for pizza to enhance their game experience turned to Dominos, with session share in the lead-up to the game almost quadrupling from 6% at 2:00 pm to 23% at 6:00 pm. DraftKings Deals the Winning Hand: Top Sportsbook Choice for Super Bowl Bets The betting frenzy sparked by the extension of the game into overtime didn’t do much to sway the preferred betting platform of choice with proportions of sessions remaining in line with the theme of the day: DraftKings was the most popular, followed by FanDuel and then BetMGM.
