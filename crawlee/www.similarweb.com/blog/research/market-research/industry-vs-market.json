Although they’re closely connected, they differ in definition, size, and nature. Read on to learn the difference between a market vs. industry, and find out how to determine yours in a few easy steps. Definition of industry An industry is often named in a way that matches the primary product or service it offers. Think: banking, cosmetics, travel, renewables, finance, and insurance. In most major economies, industries are classified by a Standard Industrial Classification Code, which identifies each and every business according to its core business activities. It is a collection of companies offering products or services that function similarly, serve the same purpose, or seek to solve the same problem. Definition of market A market is the place where services or goods are transacted. Four of the core elements of a market include: sellers, consumers, price, and commodities. It’s where groups of customers buy industry-specific goods or services. A market can be split through a process called market segmentation. Each segment consists of different products or consumer groups. Dividing a market into segments enables organizations to deliver more targeted messaging, products, and offers. For instance, in the insurance industry, a market could be defined by those who focus on life insurance, aka the life insurance market. In the renewables industry, an example of a market would be solar solutions for commercial clients. Example of industry vs. market A few practical examples of market vs. industry include: Industry example: Insurance Market examples: Healthcare insurance market, pet insurance market, auto insurance market Industry example: Finance Market examples: Mortgage market, personal loans market, currency market Industry example: Travel Market examples: Accommodation market, food and beverage market, tour operator market Difference between industry and market Now that we’ve covered the definitions of market vs. industry, it’s time to examine the key differences between each.
