These days, doing regular market research is key. Particularly given how quickly consumer behaviors shift and companies change tactics to keep up with the ever-growing number of competitors in their industry. In this post, I’m sharing six market research report templates to give you a head start and help steer your analysis in the right direction from the onset. What is a market research template? Market research templates provide questions and specific fields to fill out – relevant to specified market research objectives. You can add or remove fields according to what’s relevant to your market and research goal. It provides a framework to develop your own research methodology if you don’t want to go full-scale with a research firm. What are the advantages of using market research templates? There are many ways market research templates benefit organizations of any size. It costs less than hiring an external market research firm. Completion is often quicker because pre-set fields guide your research. Little to no professional training is required to complete a template.

Research Intelligence tools like Similarweb make it much easier to access market research data than ever before. Using a template enables you to stay focused and organized.

You set your priorities and start collecting information without untimely back-and-forth correspondence. This is particularly valuable for online companies in markets that develop and change quickly. You need real-time data to improve your results, so time is always of the essence. In addition to time, you also save costs. Comprehensive market research usually demands additional financial resources. By using shareable templates, you can involve relevant internal business units at minimal extra cost. This presents another advantage: You own your information. You can come back to the files, reuse, update, and compare whenever it’s relevant. This is particularly useful in the dynamic world of online business because you’ll want to research the market repeatedly to detect and adapt to changes. What are market research templates used for? Most types of market research templates provide a robust framework that steers market research efforts in the right direction. When we consider the “journeys” a market research report template can help with – most use cases aren’t merely one-time research projects but should include periodic monitoring and analysis. Assess your brand’s strength and influential power. Evaluate your market share, and measure which percentage of the market you reach and sell to. Launch a new product or enter a new market. Get to know the territory and the key players to avoid unnecessary risks and recognize new opportunities. Identify and keep tabs on your top competitors. Be aware of your competitor’s strengths and weaknesses to align your strategic planning. Understand your target audience. If you truly want people to resonate with your product or service, you need to take the time to get to know them, their interests, pain points, likes, and dislikes. Innovate your business model. Before applying changes to products or business strategies, understand user demand and need shifts. Drive more sales. Optimize product placement by identifying your product’s uniqueness and the specific value to boost your marketing campaigns. Fine-tune your digital advertising and analytics. Find and optimize the marketing channels and keywords with the highest potential and lowest competition. Find and follow emerging trends. Detect changes in the market development early and use them to your advantage. Five things to do before using a market research analysis template As you’ll soon discover, there are lots of tools and resources at your disposal – and you won’t need all of them to reach your goal. Your choices should depend on the goal of your research, something you’ll need to clarify before you start to use any type of market research report template.
