July 17, 2024 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic One sure way to outpace your competitors in an ever-evolving world of changing consumer tastes and preferences? Understand how to gauge market demand for your products. Why? Because knowing what your customers want and when they want it can mean the difference between sinking and swimming in todayâ€™s fast-paced, ultra-competitive landscape. In this guide, weâ€™ll take you through the ins and outs of market demand â€“ its importance, types, influencing factors, and how to analyze it for your specific products. And, of course, how to use market research tools like Similarweb to ensure youâ€™re doing it better than all of your competitors. So, letâ€™s get ready to master gauging market demand ðŸ’ª What is market demand? In the simplest terms, market demand is how much of a product that potential customers in a particular market or area are willing and able to purchase at a given price, over a specific period. In economic terms, itâ€™s a fundamental principle in helping businesses understand to what extent their products or services are desired by the market. The most fun part? Market demand fluctuates constantly. This is thanks to many influencing factors that can and will change at any given moment. Weâ€™re talking about things like economic conditions, consumer preferences and technology advancements that, as we all know, continuously reshape the market. Why is market demand important? You may be hard-pressed to think of something more important than understanding market demand. The bottom line is that if customers arenâ€™t interested in your products, youâ€™ll struggle to make sales, and theyâ€™ll be a whole load of money down the drain. The importance of market demand extends far and wide, underpinning crucial decision-making across the whole business. Understanding market demand is important for many reasons, including: 1. Allocating resources When you know which products are in demand, and when, you can allocate resources as efficiently as possible. For example, a retail giant like Amazon will hire seasonal workers during peak periods like Black Friday, Christmas and Prime Day, or a start-up may use market demand to make the most of their limited budgets by prioritizing the development of a feature that users are actively requesting. 2. Determining price This is thanks to the good old theory of supply and demand. American Airlines, for example, may use market demand to set pricing that maximizes profitability, adjusting ticket prices to reflect that higher demand leads to higher prices and vice versa. Market demand can also affect pricing strategies in other ways. A retailer like Walmart could use demand data to decide when to offer discounts and promotions on certain products, like on summer clothing towards the end of the season when demand begins to drop off. 3. Strategic planning Understanding market demand can give you the data-backed confidence needed to make more precise and effective strategic decisions about anything from product production and inventory management to marketing planning. For example, market demand will help you determine the right quantity of products you need to manufacture and when to ramp up production to meet surges in demand. Similarly, with inventory management, market demand ensures you have the right amount of stock, saving you from costly excesses or missed opportunities caused by shortages. 4. Minimizing risk Getting a grip on market demand for your products can really help you anticipate future changes in the market, helping you to minimize risks and react proactively. This could be anything from promoting lower-cost products during times of economic downturn, or knowing when to enter a new market. For example, Starbucks will leverage demand analysis to decide whether to open a new store in a new location, reducing the risk of a failed expansion. Types of market demand To help businesses with the nuances of demand, there are several different types of market demand that can be applied to specific market conditions. These include: Primary demand: refers to the total demand for all brands within a product category, driven by overall customer interest rather than interest in a specific brand. This can help when a business wants to increase the overall market size, most relevant for an emerging industry where the goal is to attract more consumers to the category itself. An example could be electric cars. Brands will want to first focus on boosting interest in electric cars over gas cars, rather than their specific brand of EVs. Selective demand: the demand for a particular brand within a category, driven by brand identity, customer loyalty and marketing strategies. This helps businesses understand when to invest in building up their brand and emphasizing their productâ€™s USPs with targeted marketing campaigns. Seasonal demand: the type of demand that fluctuates based on seasons change or specific events of the year, driven by weather, holidays, events and other predictable cycles of demand. Businesses can plan inventory and marketing strategies around seasonal peaks and troughs, or offer seasonal promotions and adapt product lines to suit changing seasonal preferences. Latent demand: a type of potential demand that hasnâ€™t been fully realized yet, driven by unmet needs and desires but hindered by lack of innovation or favorable market conditions This is a tricky situation for businesses to address. It involves identifying and tackling whatever barriers are stopping the customers from realizing the demand for the product. They must innovate and get creative to meet latent demand. A good example of this is home automation systems, which for a long time lacked the technology and accessibility to properly enter the market. With the launch of affordable options like Amazon Alexa and Google Home, the latent demand was overcome. Negative demand: when the majority dislikes/doesnâ€™t resonate with a product and avoids buying it. Another difficult nut to crack. To overcome negative market demand, businesses need to focus on addressing the driving factors behind it. Why donâ€™t people respond to my brand or product? This is usually achieved through rebranding efforts, improving product quality,or attempting to change public opinion with targeted, strategic marketing. A good example of this was when Dominoâ€™s launched its â€œPizza Turnaroundâ€™ campaign in 2009 to address the fallout after a video was released of some employees handling the food in a questionable manner. When their reputation took a hit and sales dropped, Dominos chose to face the music instead of waiting for it to blow over. They released a branded documentary video that addressed several customersâ€™ complaints about the quality of their pizza head-on, with an air of complete honesty and transparency. And, it worked. Dominoâ€™s has been at the top of the pizza chain charts in the US since 2017, with a revenue of $4.53 billion in 2022. Derived demand: demand for a product directly influenced by the demand for another product, like demand for tires driven by demand for cars. Businesses can navigate this type of demand by understanding the relationship between the connecting products to predict and respond to any changes in demand effectively. What can influence market demand? It can be hard to keep track of all the aspects that can influence demand for your products. However, hereâ€™s a quick look into some of the biggest factors that can help you predict and respond to demand changes more effectively: ðŸ’¸ How much a product costs â€“ higher prices tend to lead to a dip in demand and vice versa ðŸ¤‘ Disposable income â€“ as consumer incomes increases, the demand for products generally goes up, too ðŸ‘‘ Changing consumer preferences and tastes â€“ customers can quite literally change their preferences overnight! ðŸŒŸ The availability of substitute goods-â€“ substitute products can reduce demand for a specific product âœ¨ The availability of complementary goods â€“ demand for complementary goods can cause demand for related products to rise alongside it ðŸ“ˆ Market trends â€“ emerging trends and technological advancements can directly influence demand patterns ðŸ’¡ The strength of marketing efforts â€“ effective marketing strategies can boost demand ðŸ’² The state of the economy â€“ periods of stability or instability can hugely affect consumer purchasing power and, therefore, demand for products Market demand examples Technology Are you eagerly awaiting the newest iPhone? Youâ€™re certainly not alone. Because of this, demand for smartphones often peaks with the release of new models by tech giants like Apple, and Samsung, driven by intense consumer anticipation and a whole lot of marketing hype. Indeed, every time Apple launches a new and improved iPhone, itâ€™s a prime example of how selective demand plays out in the tech industry. Every year thereâ€™s a huge buzz created around its launch, sparked by many teasers and announcements about all the snazzy new features. Often anticipation can be so high that customers will wait for the new release before upgrading. This is mostly thanks to Appleâ€™s super loyal customer base, top-notch marketing strategies and consistency in producing new innovative features and improvements. All of this ensures that the demand for the latest iPhone always peaks around its launch. Recent example: Appleâ€™s campaign for the iPhone X was an absolute masterclass in creating hype and demand. The company highlighted revolutionary features like Face ID and the edge-to-edge OLED display through high-impact advertisements, social media buzz and live demonstrations during their keynote event. This campaign not only generated immediate sales but also reinforced Appleâ€™s position as a market leader in innovation. Seasonal fashion This is one you canâ€™t help but notice. Seasonal demand is a clear driver within the fashion industry, with winter collections naturally being more in demand during the colder months and summer collections gaining traction during warmer weather. Above, you can see that traffic to zara.com gradually increased from March 2023, peaking in June, before dropping just before autumn â€“ only to then peak again around the holidays â€“ hello party dress season! Clothing stores like Zara are a perfect example of effective management of seasonal demand. Every few months, Zara releases new collections in line with both seasonal peaks and emerging fashion trends. This constant renewal keeps the brand fresh and in demand throughout the year. Zaraâ€™s agile supply chain allows for rapid response to seasonal changes and fashion trends, making sure that in-demand products are available at the right time. This helps keep inventory and stock levels well-balanced to optimize sales and minimize waste. Also, their effective marketing strategies help emphasize the latest trends, encouraging customers to update their wardrobes with each season. Electric cars (EVs) A great example of demand influenced by customer preferences and trends is the demand for electric cars, such as Tesla and Rivian, which has surged due to things like increased environmental awareness, cutting-edge technology, and government incentives. Letâ€™s take Tesla, which has been at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution, and the launch of the Tesla Model 3. In 2017, Tesla released the Model 3 alongside a very effective campaign â€“ led by founder & CEO Elon Musk on stage â€“ that highlighted the affordability, range and innovative features of the new electric car. As part of the campaign, they leveraged online reservations, direct sales, and strategic partnerships to drive up a high level of pre-launch demand. The combination of rising environmental consciousness, favorable policies and Teslaâ€™s innovative approach has led to a significant shift in consumer preferences towards electric vehicles. Teslaâ€™s marketing campaigns effectively highlight the benefits and unique selling points of their EVs, driving strong market demand. How to find market demand with Similarweb Now that you know what market demand is, letâ€™s walk through the two main steps you need to take to do it effectively. Step 1: Gauge the market First things first. Get to grips with your market and your place in it. When you analyze the broader category, you can better understand the context in which your product exists. Weâ€™re talking trends, consumer behaviors and other market dynamics that weâ€™ve already discussed can really impact market demand. But, where to start? As a guide, hereâ€™s how you can analyze your market using Similarwebâ€™s Market Analysis module: 1. Assess market size Begin by assessing the overall market size of your productâ€™s category. As an example, weâ€™ll zone in on the Beauty and Cosmetics industry in the US. Here, you can gauge some key sizing indicators such as total visits to websites within the Beauty and Cosmetics industry from a select period (for example, over the last 12 months) and see the year-over-year (YoY) change. There are also key metrics like â€˜visits per visitorâ€™ or â€˜pages per visitâ€™ to use as industry-standard benchmarks. 2. Identify leaders Next, get a feel for the global competitive landscape. Find out which brands are killing it and which global markets are getting the most traffic by reviewing the market share breakdown: When it comes to the top players of the Beauty and Cosmetics industry, there are very few surprises here. But itâ€™s certainly interesting to see which markets are on the rise â€“ Japan saw a 17% uplift over the last year, and Brazilâ€™s market share grew by just over 10%. This is a great way to find geographic hotspots where demand for your product may be growing, so you can get ahead and strategize your marketing efforts accordingly. 3. Assess any barriers to entry within your market Build out your understanding of how difficult it is to compete within your wider industry under Market Assessment, where youâ€™ll find its â€˜Difficulty Scoreâ€™. This is based on several metrics including market saturation, customer loyalty, the strength of branded traffic and other barriers to entry. As you can see, the Beauty and Cosmetics industry has a medium Difficulty Score suggesting that itâ€™s possible to gain market share with a carefully considered product and marketing strategy. For example, it appears that customer loyalty is low in this category, which means that 80% of people who visit one beauty brand are likely to go on to visit several others. But itâ€™s also important to understand that 65% of traffic comes from direct and branded searches, showing that having a strong brand identity is also important in this industry. It might be worth spending a few extra bucks on advertising to raise brand awareness. 4. Identify risers and declining players Seeing which brands are on the rise, and which are declining in popularity, within the wider industry is a great way to understand what type of products have been resonating with your audience over the past year. For example, skincare brand With Agency has seen a 270% increase in unique visits since July 2023, showing a keen and growing interest in anti-aging skin care. Another anti-aging skincare brand, Laura Geller, makes the top 5 with an uplift of 117% YoY. 5. Get to know your competitors Another key step in understanding the competitive landscape is assessing the brand strength of top players in your industry or segment. Our Market Quadrant Analysis illustrates the performance of the top players based on key metrics for easy comparison (and business benchmarking): Here, you can dive into juicy competitive data surrounding their audience growth (growth in unique visits vs. audience size), brand strength (branded search volume vs. direct traffic), cost efficiency (PPC spend vs. change in visits) and loyalty and retention (number of returning visitors vs. exclusive visitors) This can help point you to the brands that have the most in-demand products and are masters at growing and retaining their customer base. 6. Audience demographics Naturally, an important part of understanding the demand for your products is understanding your audience, who are key drivers of that demand. Youâ€™ll find a host of audience data to dive into under our Demographics section: Here, you can see that the Beauty and Cosmetics industry has a predominantly female audience of 75%, and 30% are over the age of 45. This may suggest that, while the bulk of product assortment and marketing should be geared towards Millenial and Gen Z audiences, there is a lot of opportunity to unlock with the 45+ demographic â€“ as we can clearly see with the rising popularity of anti-aging skincare products and brands. Step 2: Gauge current demand for a topic 1. Check out the demand for topics related to your products Now weâ€™re getting to the nitty-gritty. The first thing to look at is whether demand for the relevant topic is growing using Similarwebâ€™s Demand Analysis module. Letâ€™s narrow down our Beauty and Cosmetics example and hone in on the topic of Korean Skincare. Start by uploading a list of relevant keywords into the tool. This will generate an overview of the general interest in this topic to show whether it is growing, stagnating, or declining: Here, you can compare demand between 2023-2024 with the previous year to see how itâ€™s changed. As you can see, demand for Korean skincare has skyrocketed by 84% within this period. For a more visual look at the trajectory of demand, you can also refer to Similarwebâ€™s Demand Trend graph. This can be very helpful in pinpointing any changes in seasonal demand. In fact, we can see that there was a slight dip in demand during September 2023 and again in February 2024 which would be worth investigating. 2. Keyword trends Next, itâ€™s time to see which keywords are driving the demand trends. This is so you know which keywords to use to optimize your SEO, content and paid advertising strategies to drive more traffic to your website and product listings going forward. Diving deeper, you can check out the Keywords Trend Summary, which gives a more detailed breakdown of the top search terms within the topic. For example, we can see that the keyword volume for â€˜Korean face care productsâ€™ has grown by over a whopping 2000%. But, search terms that feature â€˜k-beautyâ€™ are experiencing either slower growth or declining. Whatâ€™s keyword research without some marketplace intelligence? Using Similarwebâ€™s Shopper Intelligence platform, you can get the hottest keyword data straight from Amazon: Here, you can review what Amazon shoppers are actively searching for in your category. Check out the % change in clicks over the selected time period to gauge how demand is changing for products. For example, â€˜bubble skincareâ€™ experienced a 592% increase in clicks YoY, suggesting that their gentle, simplified skin care products have really resonated with consumers, particularly the younger generations. 3. Traffic by country As mentioned above, itâ€™s important to pinpoint geographical hot spots of demand for your chosen topic. You can do this under the Traffic by Country section: The difference here compared with the data found in Market Analysis, is that you can see where in the world traffic from either organic or paid search (or both together) is coming from for this topic. You can use the organic vs. paid split to determine whether you need to invest more money in advertising in some global markets that have a higher percentage of paid traffic â€“ like the Netherlands and Belgium. To wrap things up: Itâ€™s time to deliver on demand In todayâ€™s fierce market, understanding market demand is not just beneficial, itâ€™s essential.
