January 26, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Businesses go to great lengths to understand their customers, and for good reason. While first-party data can provide valuable insights, it isn’t always enough. We look at first, second, and third-party data, with the pros and cons for each; then explain why modern organizations must use a blended approach where data sources are concerned. There’s also a new kid on the block: zero-party data. Don’t worry; we’ll cover this too. What is first-party data? First-party data is defined as data that is collected directly from a company’s customers, website visitors, or mobile app users. It’s collected and owned exclusively by the company that gathers it. First-party data examples Email addresses collected through a subscription form Phone numbers collected through a customer contact form Website engagement metrics Purchase history from an ecommerce store Demographic information from an in-store survey Customer feedback from a loyalty program Social media engagement data Referral data from an affiliate program Product usage data from an app Location data collected through a mobile app Pros and cons of first-party data Pros of first-party data Cons of first-party data You own the data and are in complete control of it. It can be expensive to collect and maintain. Useful for the optimization of campaigns and increasing conversions. Requires significant infrastructure to store and manage information as part of a first-party data strategy. Use it to gain a better understanding of your customers and target them with personalized messages. Incomplete or inaccurate information can present itself in the data set. Complete visibility into the data and how it is being used. Difficult to interpret the data and draw meaningful conclusions. Helps you gain insights into customer behavior and trends. Challenging to keep up with changes in consumer behavior. What is second-party data? Second-party data is shared between two parties who have an existing relationship. It’s typically shared in exchange for a service or other value. Second-party data examples Website user-generated content Social media posts Aggregated reviews Location data Purchasing transactions Demographic data Third-party advertising data Loyalty program data Retailers’ inventory data Online search trends Pros and cons of second-party data Pros of second-party data Cons of second-party data Can provide access to valuable data unavailable through other sources. Often more expensive than other forms of data. Sourced from trusted partners and is more likely to be accurate. Not always available in the quantities or formats desired. As data is shared mutually between closed parties, it’s not freely available to your rivals. A challenge to determine the accuracy or reliability of the data. Provides detailed insights into customer behavior. Can be difficult to integrate with existing systems and keep up with changes in partner data sources. What is third-party data? Third-party data is collected by an outside entity and sold to companies for marketing and advertising purposes. It’s often used to target ads and can be collected from various sources, including online surveys and public records. Third-party data examples Online retail data Weather data Social media data Location data Demographic data Audience segmentation data Financial data Mobile app usage data Advertising data Marketplace data Pros and cons of third-party data Pros of third-party data Cons of third-party data Often cheaper than first or second-party data. Some sources of data are outdated and not reflective of current consumer behavior. Usually available in large quantities in various formats. Determining the accuracy or reliability of the data isn’t always easy. Useful to gain insights into consumer behavior and market trends. Integration with existing systems can sometimes be complex. Helpful if you need to target audiences with precision. It can be challenging to keep up with changes in third-party data sources. What is zero-party data? Zero-party data is intentionally and proactively shared by customers with companies in exchange for value. It’s usually obtained via opt-in surveys, quizzes, and social media posts and can be used to personalize and enhance customer experiences. Zero-party data examples Social media posts Website analytics Search engine queries User survey responses Customer support tickets Browser cookies App usage statistics Video streaming records Payment transaction records GPS location data Pros and cons of zero-party data Pros of zero-party data Cons of zero-party data Highly accurate and reliable as it is actively gathered from customers. Can be difficult and expensive to collect. It is more current and up-to-date than most other data sources at the point it is obtained. May not be available in the quantities or formats desired. Helpful for building detailed profiles of consumers. Difficult to interpret the data and draw meaningful conclusions. Can be used to increase loyalty and engagement based on known consumer interests. Customers must be willing to share their data, and privacy concerns can be an issue. Enables better personalization, both in marketing and product development. Doesn’t allow you to keep up with changes in customer behavior. First-party data vs. second-party data vs. third-party data First-party data is often the most valuable, as it’s company-specific and useful to draw insights into customer behaviors and preferences. It’s also data your rivals won’t have. However, second-party data comes into play for companies with limited access to their own customer data, and need additional insights into target customer segments. If you want to enter a new market or even start a new business, you might not have relevant internal data sets to use, and creating a first-party data strategy isn’t feasible or realistic. Let’s say you want to gain insights into consumers’ behavior and preferences, first-party data would likely be the best option. Alternatively, if you want to understand the competitive landscape, second or third-party data could be the better choice. Ultimately, the best data for a company will depend on its individual needs and goals. For a comprehensive view of a market, a mix of both first-party and third-party data is the best approach. By combining both types of data, you get a detailed view that accounts for your own customer data, along with key market intel in tandem. First-party data vs. zero-party data First-party data is useful for those with access to customer data and who need to understand their customers, preferences and behaviors better. Zero-party data is a relatively new type of data that’s best for companies that need to collect more detailed, permission-based customer data and gain deeper insights into customer behavior, preferences, behaviors, and intentions. First-party data is just one piece of the data puzzle. First-party data is important, and while it does provide valuable insights into existing customers, it is often limited in scope and accuracy. Using a comprehensive range of data sources allows businesses to gain a complete understanding of their customers and the marketplace. Additionally, by using a mix of first, second, third, and zero-party data, businesses can ensure that their strategies and data-driven decisions are independent of any single data source. Having overtaken oil, data is now considered the world’s most valued resource. But just like oil, data is of no use until after it’s been mined and handled (aka analyzed) correctly. Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine.” - Peter Sondergaard, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Research at Gartner, Inc.
