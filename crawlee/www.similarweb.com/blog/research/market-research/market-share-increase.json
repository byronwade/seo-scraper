May 18, 2021 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic For a company to see a market share increase, it’s usually down to tactics and hard work in tandem. Kleenex. Band-Aid. Chapstick. What do these terms have in common? They’re brand names that became the terms for products. Language alone shows that the brands cornered their markets, making it much easier for them to grow their market share. But most brands can’t achieve this (at least not right away). So, how can you increase your market share and profitability? In addition to quality products, you need a quality market strategy and an accurate market research tool to take a bigger share of the market. Read on to find out how to assess market share increase potential, and get tips for how to start to increase your market share. What does growing market share actually mean? Market share is basically a pie and every company in that market has a slice. As the market grows, companies need to expand with it to keep their share of that pie. So yes, growth is required just to keep what you have in most cases. If you want to increase your market share, it means you are growing faster than average. In other words, you are outperforming the competition. Here’s the formula: Market share = Your total sales / Entire market total sales *100. How to increase your market share When looking at how to do something right, it helps to have examples – companies that actually did it. Here are some of the most successful strategies industry leaders use to grow their market share. You can pick and choose the strategies that you think make the most sense for your company. 1. Level up your branding and marketing Brand identity. It’s your personality. If you don’t have one, it’s hard to make an impact. It’s even harder to build a connection with your customers. Market share leaders usually have an X-factor brand identity and marketing edge that makes them stand out. Think: Tesla, Ikea, and McDonald’s. These brands are household names. What’s important here is developing a holistic brand strategy that embodies your mission, your vision, and your message. When you develop a cohesive design and voice that reflects all these and consistently present it to your audience, you will make a lasting impression. It’s much easier to grow from a niche market compared to if you try to conquer the entire market from the jump. A classic example is Coca-Cola. This consumer giant didn’t stop after cornering the soft-drink market. The global powerhouse went after a more health-conscious and fitness-oriented market, with hydration and water products like Smart Water, Vitamin Water, and Powerade. The lesson here: Consider aligning your marketing to target a specific group or market segmentation and build a reputation. Then grow from there. 2. Keep innovating (and not just technology) To continue to grow your market share, you need new technology. Apple is a perfect example. The iPhone maker practically stands for innovation and sleek design and is constantly releasing new products. Another example is Google and its ever-changing search algorithms to improve results and meet users’ needs. Google has the largest market share of all search engines, even in regions where you’ll find other prominent search engines like Russia, and not by accident. Product development is a priority for market leaders. And even if a product itself doesn’t change, you can still innovate. Look at Starbucks and how their marketing constantly draws new attention to different seasonal trends. There’s always a way to innovate. You just need to find it. 3. Add discounts, benefits, and incentives Review your current pricing structure and compare it to your competitors. Discounts, bonuses, or extra benefits can provide an additional incentive for consumers to buy. In eCommerce, for example, companies that offer free shipping generally have an advantage, even if it means adding an extra product to your cart to meet the minimum. Find your competitive advantage. These methods can boost your business when competition is aggressive, or you’re not growing as much as you planned. 4. Cultivate your customer base Keep your eyes on your customers. Yes, your existing customers. Your current customer base generates your market share. To maintain that, you need to hold on to it and view each customer as an investment. Turn your target audience into loyal customers by making them feel appreciated, engaging with them, and most of all, listening to them. Why? Because they will show you where to invest your resources next. They can tell you what they love about your product and what they are missing. Use that in your innovation, your marketing strategy, and your pricing policy. Your customers need to keep coming back for more. When they do, they will bring their friends and families. Word of mouth is a popular marketing strategy. By nurturing customer loyalty, you’ll naturally bring in new customers, which will lead to a higher market share. 5. Look out for acquisition opportunities Sometimes the best way to increase market share is by acquiring it. Instead of putting efforts into developing new products or services that fit their vision, enterprises often buy out smaller companies that have already done that or offer a better product. This option requires financial stability and managerial capabilities. On the other hand, it keeps competition at bay. Market share increase starts with growing your traffic share If you want to grab a larger market share, you should start with traffic share.
