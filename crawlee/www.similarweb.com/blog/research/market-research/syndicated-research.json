September 30, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic When a company starts any market research project, there is a range of options at its disposal. Syndicated research is readily available, which often makes it a tempting choice. However, it’s not always the most viable option. From primary to secondary research, or quantitative to qualitative methods; the key to success often depends on choosing the right type of research. Read on to see what syndicated research is used for, its benefits, and examples. What is syndicated market research? Syndicated research is a type of secondary market research that delivers broad insights covering a specific market. It’s carried out by a third-party organization, and data is delivered in the form of a report, raw data, or presentation. This type of market research is typically conducted by a market research firm. They sell the syndicated research to multiple parties, and it’s predominantly used to help an organization understand and analyze a market. There are many reasons why people favor using a syndicated service. Perhaps the most compelling of all is the low cost, but also that it’s readily available to anyone who might need it. The major downside is that the data is available to anyone who wishes to pay for it. So there’s no exclusivity, and little competitive advantage to be gained. Syndicated Research vs. Custom Research A syndicated service delivers non-exclusive data that’s available to anyone, anytime. It’s general in nature and offers a static market perspective. On the other hand, custom research is tailored. It can take many forms, but costs more as a result. Syndicated research Custom research Ownership of the data The company conducting the research retains ownership. If the research is funded by partner companies, they will also own the data. Ownership of the research data belongs to the client for whom the custom research is being done. The type of data available Data is generalized and covers a specific market and period. The research firm will choose the method and scope of the research. Research data can be customized to suit a client’s needs. The method of research used is tailored to project goals. What can it show? General data on the state of a market. It usually runs over a fiscal or calendar year. Targeted data on any research topic of interest. Control over the direction of the research There is no control over the direction of the research. You have greater control over the direction of the research. What can the data be used for? Reports show key facts, insights, and market demographics. Data is not dynamic and only applies to the period analyzed. Useful for things like benchmarking, trendspotting, segment analysis, economic insights, audience analysis, and competitive benchmarking. What industries are covered? Some syndicated services cover specific industries. Others cover multiple. Most research providers offer total flexibility over the industry or markets being covered. Which type of research costs more money? A syndicated service costs less than custom research. Because reports are repeatedly sold, the costs of the research are shared. It costs more than syndicated research. This is due to the tailored nature of the research, and the exclusivity of the data. The benefits of syndicated market research (pros and cons) As with everything in life, the choices we make are often guided by the desired outcome, or the resources available at the time. For some, it’s more about balancing resources – with cost and time dictating whether syndicated research is right, or not. We’ve broken down the pros and cons of using a syndicated service for market research. Pros of syndicated research Costs less than hiring a market research company. Data is readily available. Helps a company identify market-specific trends. Larger sample size than custom research. Useful for a research thesis, business plan, or investment pitch deck. Cons of syndicated research Research company dictates the project methodology, questions, and topics. Information in a syndicated report is freely available to anyone who buys it. Data is broad-market data, offering few granular insights of value. It cannot be used to identify moving changes or trends in a market. Data is not dynamic – information quickly becomes outdated.

Insights are up to date and reveal timely trends that syndicated research reports don’t have the capacity to uncover. Wrapping up…. Syndicated market research serves a basic purpose. It gives you a point-in-time analysis of a specific market. However, this data won’t continue to give you insights as the market changes, and it cannot show you things like changing trends, conditions, or competitive research data that can give you a real edge in your market. So, if you’re going to invest in any form of market research for your business, it’s vital to take this into consideration – and look at the best alternatives to syndicated research.
