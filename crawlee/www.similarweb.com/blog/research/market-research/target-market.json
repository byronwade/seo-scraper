December 21, 2023 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Apparently, some people can sell ice to an Eskimo. If your company doesn’t employ salespeople with superhuman selling powers, however, it’s critical to cater your product or service, as well as your marketing efforts, to the specific target market most likely to purchase it. What is a target market? A target market is a distinct customer group with shared characteristics such as demographics, income, lifestyles, or behaviors and is a subset of the total market for a product or service. It is regarded as the most likely potential customer for a business, maximizing the profitability and success of its marketing efforts. In other words, your target market is a niche group of people who are most likely to buy your product — be it to satisfy a need or solve a pain point. When conducting your market research, you should be laser-focused on reaching and attracting that group because they’re just waiting to discover you. If targeted correctly, they’ll become your biggest fans, be devoted enthusiasts of your products, and invite all their friends to your profit party, with increased market share as the VIP guest. That’s why you must define your target market, clearly understand it, and create a business plan to attract your ideal potential customer. You can start with broad categories like location and age groups, but the more granular you get with the help of digital intelligence, the more you can boost your conversion rates. Your target market strategy will include adapting your product lines, packaging, and distribution channels to win your fans’ approval or optimizing your marketing strategy and messaging to speak their language.

Learn more Target market example: Anti-aging face cream Here’s a target market example. If you were to sell anti-aging face cream, you’d likely not succeed in selling it to many consumers under thirty, right? Some skin-conscious shoppers might start worrying about their wrinkles in their twenties, and they may even buy your product, but your biggest devotees, that sweet spot of solidarity, will come from that group above thirty-five. Your primary target market will be the consumers to whom you are catering your product and marketing resources, in this case, clientele over thirty-five. Your secondary target market will be niche pockets of clientele, for example, people with certain skin disorders, dry skin, or sun-damaged skin who want to revive their appearance. But let’s not guess. Let’s delve into Similarweb Digital Data based on real-user digital signals inside Amazon. Here’s some of what you can learn about the Wrinkle & Anti-Aging Devises category with a few clicks on your keyboard: Over 63% of the consumers visiting the category are above 35 years of age Almost 80% of them are female More than 75% work full-time, and most have an annual income of $50K – $100K The vast majority are college-educated (83.5%) 47% live in a two-person household Shopper insights, Wrinkle & Anti-Aging Devises category on Amazon, Dec 2022 – Nov 2023 Whether launching a new product for anti-aging face cream or trying to grow its existing market share, you’ll have to understand and consider your target market. The more you know about your potential customers, the more you can cater to them. A famous TikTok teen might look great on the packaging but won’t feel relatable or might even be offputting to your more mature customers, and a glass jar will probably feel more credible than a squeezy tube. You might even decide to create two separate products, each appealing to different target markets. When marketing your skin-reviving cream, there will be specific keywords that appeal to your group of fans, language that resonates with who they are, and places where they like to shop, be it online or at brick-and-mortar stores. These factors must be considered, and defining your target market is vital to that data-driven decision-making process. The five main target segments When conducting your target market analysis, you’ll want to divide your audience into distinct market segments to be more effective in reaching and engaging it. Don’t worry about getting too specific. Consumers outside your chosen scope can and will still buy your products. No one is stopping them from joining your fan club. They just won’t be the primary focus of your marketing campaigns. You can examine many market segmentations, but they mostly fall under 5 main categories. Demographic — This segment includes the fundamental traits identifying your target audience. Every potential customer falls into a specific age group, generation, income level, gender, and education level. Geographic — With the ever-increasing impact of globalization and streamlined shipping processes, this segment has become more critical to consider, as regional trends will affect your conversion rates. Firmographic — Suitable for business-to-business (B2B) companies and considers the target market’s industry, location, size, number of employees, average sales cycle, customers, and products. Psychographic — This segment delves deeper into the “why” behind the decision-making and considers lifestyle, hobbies, interests, dislikes, opinions, attitudes, and values that drive a person’s buying habits. Behavioral — This segment closely examines what your audience does, how it behaves, and what it comes into contact with to spot untapped product and marketing opportunities and relies heavily on research into market trends. What’s the difference between your target market and your target audience? Once you’ve analyzed your product utilizing these five target segments and understood the characteristics of the consumers it serves, you’ll have your target audience, which is the specific section of your target market on which you will focus your strategic efforts. It’s critical to base your target audience on thorough audience research. Successful companies have insights specialists who read reports, conduct surveys, and analyze digital data to target consumers who are genuinely interested in their product, even if they don’t align with the initially intended customer base. If, for example, your company decided to create a product to compete with the Air Tag, it would face heavy competition from Apple, an established consumer electronics company with a devoted following — the Apple cult. You could market your tag as a crucial product for travelers. On the other hand, you could find a niche market you can appeal to and build your product and marketing around it. With extensive research, you might discover that pet owners require a small GPS device for their cats and dogs. You could then design a product with pet icons and create ads utilizing targeted keywords such as “pet gps tracker” and social posts that appeal to dog and cat owners. The mini GPS tracker might still appeal to travelers looking for a lively design (the target market), but you’d craft your marketing campaign to target the dog owners, your target audience.
