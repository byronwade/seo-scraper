Different types of market research Market research is a questions and answers game. Once you’ve asked the important questions, you’ll need to choose the right type of research to get your answers. There are four core types of research, each of which can be applied to help you solve a problem or gather insights to inform key decisions. Primary market research Primary market research is the first-hand collection of data. It’s data that’s not available to others, and can be obtained in a number of ways. Here are the most common. Web Metrics Use analytics software that provides traffic and engagement metrics to understand how audiences behave. Observation To observe how users behave and navigate your site, you can install software that records visits and creates heatmaps. Such tools are useful for qualitative research regarding your UX/UI and at the same time, quantify the findings. Customer surveys Survey questionnaires and polls can be distributed to any number of customers through email, SMS, your site, or social media. They let you collect both qualitative and quantitative data from respondents using open-ended questions. Focus groups You select a small number of people for a group discussion. A moderator leads the session with questions and records the conclusions. This is also a form of qualitative research, and you would use it to get in-depth information. Face-to-face interviews Another qualitative assessment method is one-on-one interviews. Consumers representative of your target audience or a segment of it are selected to answer questions about a specific research topic. Phone calls To involve a larger number of people and get more answers, you can conduct surveys over the phone. These interviews would be less specific and include fewer questions.

It’s available to all who wish to consume it. Using this type of data is preferred by those who wish to keep costs low, as it can be quicker and freely available. Government reports and census data Annual, quarterly, and other periodic industry reports are a rich data source to tap into. Government organizations publish statistics in areas of trade, ecommerce, and finance. Academic papers and educational resources University research is a source of high-quality information. This is useful for in-depth background information on a broad scale. Online articles and case studies, public and commercial sources Industry-specific publications can be a valuable source of information for market segmentation, providing you with data and insights on market trends or a specific market segment or niche.

Here are just a few examples of what market research is used for, with a few real-world examples thrown in for good measure. 1. Company research Market research allows you to shine a spotlight on any business and unpack its wins and losses for your own gain. Let’s say you are doing market research for a business plan; you’ll likely want to evaluate the successes of others in your industry.

Competitive benchmarking Most of your relevant data will come from your competition. If you plan to offer something that’s new for you but already exists in the market, learn from other’s mistakes and successes. If your goal is to evaluate and optimize, collect competitors’ data, and compare it to yours. See what works for them, find their weak spots, and improve on them. What market research gives you here, is the ability to systematically compare each of your rivals. And, it’s not as complex as it sounds either. Simply choose a type of competitive analysis frameworks to use, complete the template for each; then compare the results to uncover relevant insights.

Data collection over time helps you understand the dynamics of the market. Some markets have strong seasonal fluctuations. Increased shopping during December is an obvious example, but often these shifts are not always evident unless you measure and analyze them specifically. With the data from your historical market research, you can evaluate their impact and the likelihood you will keep seeing these trends. Based on that, you can make predictions about future developments. 4. Audience analysis Who will find your product most useful and why? Examining the size of your audience and the existing demand for your product or services is crucial. Understanding your target audience allows you to build your product offering and marketing strategy more efficiently. You also want to learn first-hand where people buy this type of product and how much they are willing to spend so that you can estimate your reachable market share. Here’s a quick example of how we use Similarweb to do effective audience analysis. You can unpack key audience demographics for any site you choose. And get up-to-date stats about gender, age, location, interests, browsing habits, and more. 5. Market segmentation There are lots of ways to segment a market. Doing this well can deliver higher conversions, reduce costs, redefine marketing strategies, and help you connect with customers on a more personal level. Market research can help you do most types of market segmentation, the most widely adopted of all is demographic segmentation. Here, you look for shared but specific characteristics of a target audience. Using Similarweb, I can view audience demographics for a website, and compare it side-by-side with rival sites.

Marketing strategy Market research can also help you reach the right decision regarding where to advertise or market your business.

View the various channels across social media, email, direct, organic search, paid search, and display ads to see which channels convert and where the highest channel traffic comes from. 7. Customer experience Market research is your best way to get information that isn’t naturally visible but that may significantly affect your business. Just think, the fact that your users don’t complain doesn’t necessarily mean they are all delighted with what you offer. While some customers tend to keep their criticism to themselves, others will be vocal and leave reviews online. Market research is a powerful tool to help inform improvements to services and products alike. Asking for feedback, listening to it, and looking at the feedback left for rivals in your market can uncover telling insights that can shape service offerings, marketing campaigns, and new feature development.
