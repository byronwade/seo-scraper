November 24, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic In the battle of instinct vs insight, there’s clear evidence that data-driven decision-making pays off. A McKinsey study into data-driven decision-making found that organizations using data to make decisions are more likely to be profitable and can more effectively retain and acquire customers vs those who fail to use this approach. Whether you’re launching a new product, investing in a promising startup, or designing a marketing campaign, data-driven decision-making is a necessity few can afford to ignore. In this article, we’ll show you why making decisions based on data is critical, how to implement it in your organization, and give an example of data-driven decision-making. What is data-driven decision-making (DDDM)? Data-driven decision-making is the process of making decisions based on reliable data, insights, and facts. It’s a decision-making approach that collects, analyzes, and interprets data around critical KPIs and can be used as a foundation for all business decisions. Using research as part of the validation process for any initiative makes good business sense. Today, 90% of enterprise professionals report that data and analytics are key to their core transformation initiatives. Modern consumers are leaving more data traces online than ever, allowing businesses to study everything from their interests and behavior to purchase preferences and brand associations. With more comprehensive, reliable, and accurate data, organizations can make data-driven decisions faster than ever – helping them pivot and flex at pace. The benefits of data-driven decision-making Making data-driven decisions allows organizations to identify trends, formulate new services or products, do accurate forecasting, and establish the most effective channels for growth. It can impact almost every area of an organization, from customers, employees, recruitment, sales, and revenue. 1. Achieve a higher ROI Data-driven decisions directly impact company profitability. Doing it provides relevant insights that can help increase sales and decrease losses. When choices are based on solid numbers rather than instinct or personal preferences, a company can make decisions logically and with greater confidence. 2. Shift from reactive to proactive Data provides insights that enable you to identify trends and patterns and accurately forecast the demand. With the right data, you can plan more confidently, calculate risks, and discover opportunities others can’t see. This allows you to be more proactive and make early moves that others won’t. It’s just like having night-vision glasses in the dark – you see things others cannot, and you react and respond accordingly. 3. Improve customer experience Satisfied customers use your service for longer, spread the word about your business, and become advocates for your brand. A data-driven decision-making approach helps you boost customer satisfaction levels by: Regularly measuring customer satisfaction Gathering feedback Spotting trends Identifying dissatisfaction sources Taking steps to counter dissatisfaction Optimizing processes and services to improve service standards Without data, it’s hard to truly know what customers feel about your product. When your decisions are based on solid data, you know where you stand and how you can better meet and exceed customer expectations. 4. Gain a competitive advantage Staying one step ahead of competitors is the hallmark of all successful companies. Where your market is concerned, knowledge is power. A data-driven decision-making approach allows you to closely monitor your competitors actions, campaigns, and tactics. As a result, you’re better positioned to predict their moves and counter their strategies by making more timely and informed decisions. Data-driven decision-making example This sample shows competitive research in action. It was shared with us by Wonderbly, an international firm serving 6 million customers. By analyzing the audience demographics of a key rival and looking at gender and age distribution, it was able to identify the competition was doing a better job at attracting a younger audience. Wonderbly used Similarweb to view rivals’ website demographics alongside their own. Here’s what it was able to determine. Wonderbly was winning with the female audience, with 62% vs 56% in its favor. However, its rivals were better at attracting a male audience, and its share in the 18-24 age range was just 12% vs 19%. Showing a clear opportunity to do more to reach both younger and male personas. Impact: It developed a new audience profile and significantly changed future campaigns. It was then able to grow its business and attract more new customers. 5. Greater confidence in decision making Data-driven decisions remove uncertainty, minimize gray areas, and enable you to see things clearly. Your decisions aren’t guesswork or wishful thinking. It comes from taking calculated steps based on insights from comprehensive data collected across your customer’s life cycle. Naturally, this means you have confidence in your decisions which trickles down to your teams and allows them to follow your instructions with greater conviction. 6. Faster access to insights In today’s ever-changing markets, consumer behaviors shift at lightning speed; emerging players appear and grab market share at a moment’s notice, and disruptive technologies impact entire industries in an instant. Having a faster speed to insight can help your business respond to changes much quicker, compete, and stay ahead of the curve. Data helps you spot these changes while there’s still time to do something about it; without faster access to insights, you risk being left behind.

How to practice data-driven decision-making in your business To develop a culture of data-driven decision-making in your company, there’s a process to follow and a mindset to shift. Everyone can benefit from using data to make decisions from the most experienced business leader to those just entering the workplace. 1. Set clear goals that align with business objectives What do you want to achieve with data? That’s the first question you should answer before investing in data analytics or any other solution. For example, you might be looking to optimize your processes, find loopholes, and identify your most profitable sales channels. Or you might be looking for more audience insights to inform your marketing or product development strategy. Whatever it is, you need to set clear goals to measure and track key metrics over time. 2. Conduct market research Consult your internal teams and decision makers to understand the questions they want data to answer, their current data sources, and how they want to improve them. Based on their feedback, conduct market research to find ways other companies handle these challenges. This would help you understand the data sources you need to improve and the market research tools required to meet your company’s decision-making needs. 3. Collect and prepare data To analyze and interpret data, you must first identify all your existing and potential data sources and build a centralized data repository. This can be challenging if your decision-makers currently use data from disconnected sources. In particular, there’s the risk of data duplication and inaccuracy. So, you must ensure that your data is credible and relevant to facilitate effective decision-making. 4. Analyze your results, look for patterns, and explore Now that you’ve collected and organized your data, analyze it from relevant angles to find answers to your questions. This is where data visualization and dashboarding come in handy. Using charts, graphs, trend lines, and other visualization types, you can make your data more accessible and easier to understand. 5. Develop insights Representing data with visualization is one thing but summarizing its core findings and insights requires deeper analysis. You must connect the dots between the various data sets to see if they answer your questions and provide insights for decision-making. 6. Collaborate and make decisions Once you’ve developed insights and have data-backed answers to your questions, it’s time to communicate them with your teams and other stakeholders. By using data storytelling, you will help your audience understand the context behind your data, and see the bigger picture and details behind your decisions. It also helps to bring the key decision-makers in your company on board and makes your data-driven decision-making process more transparent.
