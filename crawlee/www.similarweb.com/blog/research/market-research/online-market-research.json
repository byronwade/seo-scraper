Oh, and it’s not just you. Over 53% of consumers do online research routinely, with an astounding 95% reading online reviews before making a purchase. What is online market research? Online market research takes secondary data from the internet or collects primary data online to support research or expand knowledge for a chosen topic. The information is then analyzed to inform or substantiate a theory. Here are a few things you can do with digital market research: Discover new topics or content to write about Track consumer journeys See what creatives and ads perform well Find the best marketing channels Explore which markets are ripe for entry Analyze a target audience Research potential product or service improvements Benchmark your business Understand market dynamics and spot trends Find out what your competitors are doing and unpack their tactics Uncover new opportunities Digital market research can help a company grow efficiently and effectively—supporting a business in its quest to stay relevant; and to survive and thrive in its market. Take two, and hear first-hand from Harvard Business School Professor Rem Koning about the difference between traditional market research and state-of-the-art Digital Intelligence powered by behavioral data from Similarweb. Online market research methods Almost all online market research methods can be grouped into two subcategories; primary or secondary market research. Within these two core groups, you also have qualitative and quantitative research methods to consider. Here’s a quick explainer of the core four types of online market research, including what they are and how to use them. Primary Market Research This is the first-hand collection of data by an organization. It gives full control over what questions are asked. The data obtained isn’t freely available online to anyone else, and the person or company conducting the research retains full ownership of the information they acquire. This type of research wasn’t always this easy to do online. Thanks to advancements in technology and the heightened use of video conferencing in our daily lives – many types of primary research can be done remotely. Market research surveys, online focus groups, and interviews are perhaps the most widely adopted form of online primary research online. See below for a complete list of primary research types. Secondary Market Research This takes information from various sources online and repurposes it to inform or pad-out research into a chosen topic. It’s often quicker and cheaper to conduct than primary market research but offers fewer controls regarding research methodologies and customization. This data is freely available to anyone online, providing no exclusivity with the insights or information used. This type of digital market research is also known as desk research and is a tried and tested way to gather facts or insights into a market, consumers, competitors, or products. Research reports, digital intelligence platforms, media outlets, and rival websites are some of the most relevant types of research. But there are others Aside from the core online market research methods, there are two other well-known research types to consider. Qualitative Market Research This type of digital market research looks at how people feel about a specific topic or brand. It takes more time to plan than most other forms of research, often with a smaller group of people. Let’s say you want to trial a new feature or product; you’d do this form of research pre-launch or post-trial to get under the hood and understand consumer sentiment. As a form of primary data, it’s a highly tailored form of research that aims to give granular insights into why things are the way they are. Some of the most popular forms of qualitative research that can be done entirely online include focus groups, online forums, and interviews.

It’s a process that collects and analyzes data, dealing with primary and secondary information contained in a numerical format. The uses of quantitative market research include making predictions, trendspotting, finding patterns, and establishing averages in a market or business. If an organization needs to do market sizing, market validation, and forecasting – they’ll usually use quantitative research to inform these activities. It can be done online when you need to gather numerical data from or about a target audience. It’s delivered in mixed formats, including raw data, charts, graphics, and tables. A common form of quantitative research that’s done online is a survey—specifically those using close-ended questions with answer options that have a numerical value. Once the values are collected, various analysis tools can be used to turn them into insights.

This means you need to collate any: Tools Templates Research questions Delegation of any responsibilities As someone who’s written extensively about doing online market research and spoken with many thought leaders and professionals about the topic, the biggest tip I can provide is this. Pro Tip: Take a systematic approach to documenting your findings. Record everything in a workable file in a centralized space.

Regardless of the type of digital market research you choose, always keep your research goal in mind. If you’re using tools like Similarweb Research Intelligence to do industry, company, or market research, then make sure you compare the right data sets that examine the same periods and location. For secondary research, ensure that any reports or stats are backed up with verifiable sources. And for primary research, specifically, focus groups or surveys – be open to needing to change the line or type of questions being asked if you don’t feel confident the feedback will answer your research question adequately. 5. Analysis time This final step in doing online market research involves summarizing your uncovered data. If you took on board the tip about using a systematic way of collecting data, this is where your foundation-setting will really start to pay off. Once the data is summarized, you can start to analyze and uncover key insights that give you answers to your initial research questions and help bring you closer to your goals.
