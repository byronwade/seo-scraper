March 31, 2021 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Crypto has had a monumental year. In December, Bitcoin (BTC) shot past $20,000, and at the time of writing, BTC is trading just below the $60,000 level. This rapid ascent may feel like déjà vu from 2017 when BTC climbed from $975 to $20,089. An analysis of the digital growth of U.K. cryptocurrency sites, along with worldwide events, indicates that financial services companies should keep a close eye on crypto this time. We’ll show you some tools to help. U.K. cryptocurrency sites traffic soars 1. U.K. crypto traffic growth Traffic growth to the top 10 U.K. cryptocurrency exchange websites demonstrates that digital currencies have become attractive for mainstream investment.

This upswing in traffic is significantly greater than that of the next biggest traffic winners – Turkey, Vietnam, and Germany.

While traffic to crypto exchanges grew 212% in two years, the majority of growth (128%) occurred in the last three months of 2020. Pandemic-related worldwide economic activity and crypto-industry milestones helped drive up the price. Government spending induces fear In the first half of 2020, governments spent trillions of dollars in stimulus payments due to the pandemic. The result: mounting fears of currency debasement. Unlike government currencies that can be issued subjectively, only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created – distrust in fiat helped inch up crypto growth. October digital currency milestones October brought some major announcements from payments providers. The general public became more reliant on contactless payments during the pandemic. Therefore, when favorite payment providers recognized BTC, they took notice. PayPal accepts Bitcoin PayPal announced that it will allow customers to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. With the ability to use Bitcoin on the payments platform, customers can use digital assets to shop among the 26 million eCommerce merchants on the network. Square announces $50M in crypto investment Payments company Square announced that it will put approximately $50 million, or 1% of its assets, into cryptocurrency. 5 tips for harnessing up-to-date cryptocurrency insights Given the hyper-fast pace of the cryptocurrency market, many real-time insights you read here or from other sources may be obsolete shortly after they are published.
