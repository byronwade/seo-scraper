May 11, 2021 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Web visits to the insurance industry jumped nearly 33 percent year-over-year (YoY) from May 2020–April 2021. As consumers spent more time online in general, insurance websites benefited. So, which sites are driving traffic and why? We’ll answer this by analyzing the top 10 most visited insurance sites using insights from Similarweb platform, and provide takeaways for insurance brands. Benchmarks from the top 10 insurance websites Average monthly visits: 10.5M Month-over-month (MoM) change in traffic volume: -6.48% Average session duration: 5:47 Unique monthly users: 5.9M Bounce rate: 33.6% 1. It’s time to get mobile Mobile visits accounted for 55% of traffic to the top-ranked sites, exceeding the overall industry average (48%). We suspect that this is because the top insurance sites provide better mobile experiences, resonating more with the insurance industry’s largest demographic of digital users. The 25–34-year-olds age range makes up the industry’s largest demographic (22%). For the top 10 websites, this number is higher (24%). This generation prefers to make purchases using mobile devices and tablets (36%) over laptop or desktop computers (24%). Millennials’ (24–39) spending power will continue to rise. By 2030, the collective annual income of millennials worldwide is expected to exceed 4 trillion dollars. Therefore, brands should focus on catering to their needs and habits. Key takeaway Insurance providers should make sure that their websites are optimized for mobile and provide mobile convenience to customers. Geico, the second-most visited site on our list, features live chat on its mobile website, and, a mobile app – two features other brands can emulate. Moreover, insurance providers can include apps to allow policyholders to access and manage claims online. Geico, the second most visited website, provides a mobile-friendly experience for users 2. Auto insurance: Progressive and Geico take top spots Progressive and Geico, took the number one and number two spots, on our list. Traffic to both increased approximately 4 and 3 million, respectively vs. the prior period. Skyrocketing consumer interest in car rentals helped propel this growth. With fears of flying and riding trains due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cars became the preferred way to travel propelling demand (and prices) for car rentals. Consumers that aren’t already covered by existing auto insurance, need insurance for renters. Traffic share of Progressive and Geico vs. competitors (via Similarweb PRO) “Renters insurance” was the number one trending keyword over the last year for the competitive set. Terms related to “renters insurance” including “renter’s insurance,” “renter insurance,” and “what is renter’s insurance,” composed nearly half of the top 10 trending keywords. Terms relating to renter insurance make up 4 out of 10 top keywords last year (via Similarweb PRO) Although the most traffic share went to Allstate, number four on our list, Progressive and Geico were not far behind and went after traffic share for the term. Progressive ran paid ads for renter insurance-related keywords, its top-performing search ad, which went to a specific landing page for the campaign. Key takeaway If organic content does not generate significant traffic share for top searched terms, brands can invest in paid search ads. 3. Health insurance: healthcare.gov wins Traffic MoM decreased to all but one of the top 10 sites – healthcare.gov (+6.08%) the U.S. government’s health insurance marketplace. This increase can be attributed to government policy change. Under the Trump administration, citizens had 45 days, Nov. 1–Dec. 15, to enroll in government healthcare. When Biden took office, he signed an executive order to extend the open enrollment deadline (currently it is August). The extension reduced the urgency to enroll within a narrow time period. As a result, web traffic to healthcare.gov increased less drastically from November –December than in previous years during open enrollment. Though traffic increased less during these two months, it remained at elevated levels at the beginning of 2021. Visits to healthcare.gov regularly spike November – December but were less in 2020, but remained elevated in 2021 due to the extension of open enrollment With the ability to sign up through summer, we expect traffic to remain at slightly elevated levels compared to previous years.
