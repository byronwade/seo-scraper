It was new for us, and new also for investors who received valuable data they had no access to before.

One month into the Corona crisis, we added a heatmap that shows in real time which industries areas were most affected. Pro Tip: With access to website traffic data, investors can choose the relevant metrics to evaluate and benchmark company performance and forecast growth. By doing this, investment managers increase conviction in investment hypotheses and find new investment opportunities. Read the full post: What is alternative data and how to integrate it into your investment process One of the big winners this year was the American food delivery service DoorDash. As of January 2020, the company owns the largest market share. And it’s been great ever since because the demand for delivery services, specifically for food, has only increased. Ahead of its IPO (initial public offering) on Dec. 9th, we took a close look at its history, growth, and potential. Just the kind of information investors needed at this point in time. The in-depth financial analysis next to traffic analysis of DoorDash in relation to its rivals—such as Uber Eats—is still relevant after the IPO. 2021 promises to be an exciting year for DoorDash and investors. Stay on top of the data with our alternative data Stock Intelligence. Pro Tip: In its SEC filing, DoorDash calls itself the market leader but notes that “US consumers on our platform in September 2020 represented less than 6% of the U.S. population as of September 30, 2020.” It adds, “We believe we are in the early phases of broad market adoption.” Read the full post: DoorDash IPO: Insights into Online Performance Bonus Blog I don’t know about you, but I’m ready for a fresh new year.
