November 12, 2020 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Today, we’re announcing the next generation of Similarweb, an exciting step toward significantly enhancing the way companies win in the new digital reality. Our new product enhancements provide digital marketers and researchers with the opportunity to boost their strategy and digital presence to new heights by giving them access to advanced tools that will change the way competitive intelligence works. I’m proud of the progress we’ve made at Similarweb, by working with the industry’s top leaders to identify the unique challenges facing the digital world. With the unforeseen obstacles 2020 has brought to all of us, Similarweb has remained laser-focused on innovating a 360-degree, all-inclusive digital intelligence platform. Today, we’re launching something that will set your business up for success in all situations that may come your way. Similarweb shines a light on the digital world – so you can be more efficient in setting your strategy and capturing market share. We don’t have to tell you that the challenges you face as a digital business are unique. Promoting products, services, and content is a whole new ballgame compared to the physical world. Competition is vast and global – these days, even more so than before. There are truly no borders in the online world. The market changes constantly and quickly, and anyone can join the game at any time (and get out just as quickly). Ultimately, the internet is a big black box. Business leaders can use direct measurement tools like Google Analytics to measure their own growth but are still flying blind because they can’t see if their performance is good or bad in relation to direct competitors and the industry as a whole. While a clear market leader or emerging player may be present, there is no visibility into the digital marketing strategies and tactics that have driven that growth. This makes it nearly impossible to build a truly successful plan. We created the next generation of Similarweb with digital marketers and researchers in mind. Digital marketing professionals struggle to grow traffic to their sites significantly and to use their marketing budgets efficiently. Why? Because they lack the data that matters. Marketers consistently analyze their own direct measurement analytics to understand how their website is performing but are lacking tools to gain actionable insight into the results, marketing channels, and tactics that their competitors use to acquire traffic. This competitive intelligence is critical in formulating an effective SEO and content strategy, affiliate programs, display ads strategy, and more due to the competition to reach and engage with the same audience. Market research specialists struggle to gain context within the market and set a competitive digital strategy. In addition to their regular reporting of their own performance, they need reporting on their market share to guide and validate their initiatives. Strategists need to perform company teardowns of competitors or market leaders to collect best practices. Audience developers or consumer insights leaders need to understand where their audience spends time online outside of their digital properties, and who their competitors’ audiences are to improve content and target to reach them better. We’ve heard these struggles time and time again. We’ve come so far in the digital age that it’s time for transparency and access to advanced digital research tools to help you be more efficient when building a winning strategy to capture new audiences and more market share. The path to our new solutions Our goal at Similarweb has always been to empower business professionals to confidently set digital strategies in virtually all facets of the organization. This includes benchmarking performance against your peers, uncovering new opportunities and threats in the market, and learning from competitors’ marketing tactics to outpace them and grow your market share. We believe that information is true power. The more you know about the competition, your market, and your digital space, the more your digital strategy will gain. In February 2019, we launched dedicated capabilities for specific customer needs. These included streamlined access to critical marketing metrics and alerts, including Workspaces, Website Segment Analysis, and the Keyword Generator. The reception we received from our customers was fantastic. We decided to double down on a use case orientation in our product to create the next generation of our Solutions. Our new advanced interface will help your business in three ways: Increase revenue Mitigate risk Save time & better utilize resources By having access to in-depth, data-driven analytics, you’ll be able to grow your business and therefore increase revenue by having a wealth of information at your fingertips guiding you to successful business growth.

Lastly, you’ll save time (and therefore valuable money!) by quickly finding actionable insights and improving resource efficiency.
