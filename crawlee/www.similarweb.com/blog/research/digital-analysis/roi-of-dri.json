Watch the recap of our webinar featuring Forrester. What is digital intelligence, and why is it important? In its simplest terms, digital intelligence helps you understand how you perform in the online world. It collects and analyzes website or mobile app performance, traffic and engagement, marketing channels, keyword strategy, and more. It’s how you explore your market, discover industry trends, analyze competitive performance, and understand audience behavior. Digital intelligence gives you access to the top trends and data in the digital world. Think of it as a user manual for what’s happening in your industry with your competitors and audience’s behavior. Researchers and strategists that aren’t using digital intelligence are missing out on valuable data that can help them react quickly to potential threats, mitigate any risks, and identify white space opportunities. How will digital intelligence boost your ROI? First of all, you’ll save time. No more wasted days searching for the right information to help formulate your plans. The data you need will be available at the click of a button. Digital research also saves you money by helping you to effectively discover trends in your industry and identify new market opportunities. It’ll also help reduce costs on keywords while at the same time increasing traffic.
