May 16, 2022 X Facebook Linkedin Copy link Free Website Traffic Checker Discover your competitors' strengths and leverage them to achieve your own success Analyze Traffic Researching digital data can be like mind acrobatics. You need to bend over backward to dig up the precise data that generate the insights for your reports. But some researchers master their tasks with the elegance of an Olympic gymnast. How do they do it? We found Nicole, who delivered a perfect 10-routine at the leadership meeting, to be a perfect example. As part of our winner series, Nicole reveals some of her secrets and describes how she manages to present outstanding numbers time after time. Get into a winning routine We caught Nicole right after she finished presenting to the board. Her performance was widely applauded and earned her the highest score so far. We’re not surprised; Nicole has had a fantastic gymnastics season. We wanted to know what her secret is and asked the research specialist to share her success formula. To our surprise, Nicole said it was no secret at all, and she was happy to walk us through how she put her pitch together. We discovered simple routines that everyone can follow. “I use Similarweb Research Intelligence,” said the research athlete. “The platform offers an array of web measuring and monitoring tools, one of them designed for market, audience, and company research. Every industry research routine starts with an overview of the type of research data required for various types of reports.” Nicole can conduct an all-inclusive web industry analysis, or she can run audience-based research and analyze search intent. A third option is app category analysis. For some competitions, Nicole also inspects specific rivaling companies under company research. Discover and leverage your potential “In my recent routine, I needed to show there’s a potential market for a new feature release,” Nicole tells us. “For this, I went for the industry research routine because it delivers the necessary data on market share, market growth, market trends, and the audience. With a single click, I can identify the market leader and then dive into the details on where they get traffic from, how they market, and to whom”. We’ve seen her exercise, when Nicole opened by showing the industry’s overall growth. From there, she managed an effortless transition to executing a breakdown of market share distributed among the top companies in her industry. Industry trends view with market share breakdown. Get the management to applaud and buy in But that was the easy part of Nicole’s pitch. “How were you able to find the convincing arguments to get your leadership’s buy-in?” We asked. Nicole smiled. “Actually, it wasn’t as difficult as I expected.” She admits and explains to us how she used Similarweb audience research features to learn about her competitors’ audience demographics, behavior, and loyalty. She discovered that several leading companies share her audience and that large parts of the competitor’s loyal audience also frequently visit rivaling sites. Nicole understood that it would be easy to reach the target audience for the new feature because they overlap with the current actual audience. Also, behavior shows that the target audience is interested in comparing and finding new offers. “I chose to present the audience overlap in my pitch. My management is always impressed by the benchmarking capabilities and it’s visually very appealing”. Be persistent and exercise We thank Nicole for sharing the exclusive insights. We have a feeling that Nicole will continue to impress us and her management with research routines that build on Similarweb data. The platform enables her to turn web data into the actionable insights she needs to win. Nicole believes that winning can become a routine, but you need to put in consistent work, a bit of creativity, and a lot of persistence.
